Petra spent 15 years on the show, having joined in 1962            Blue Peter presenter Simon Groom holds Blue Peter pet Goldie as he announces his engagement to Ann Costelloe, who was not a presenter, on the set of the show in 1979She first appeared on Blue Peter in 1962, when its very first presenter Christopher Trace fronted the show alongside Valerie Singleton.Petra, who was looked after by Trace, appeared as a regular for 15 years, and remained the longest serving animal companion until 2011.There is even a bronze bust of the beloved canine, crafted by William Timym, outside the Blue Peter studios in Salford.Petra gave birth to the second Blue Peter pet, Patch, in 1965. The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

As became tradition, her name was chosen by viewers.Goldie was the first in a long line of Golden Retrievers to appear on the show, including one of her puppies, Bonnie, who joined in 1986.The new mother left the show shortly after giving birth, and went to live with Groom on his Derbyshire farm.Bonnie then took up the mantle - and appeared with 16 different presenters on 1,150 editions of Blue Peter.The show\u0027s second Border Collie, Mabel, joined the show when she was just six months old in 1996, after being rescued by the RSPCA in south London.She became the longest serving pet since Petra, and was recognisable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears.Mabel frequented the show alongside Lucy, a pedigree Golden Retriever who joined in 1998.Both Mabel and Lucy passed away within a month of each other in 2011, having served on the show for 14 and 12 years respectively.

Barney was the show\u0027s ninth dog - a former stray given to Helen Skelton by the Dogs Trust.The playful pup was said to receive just as much fan mail as Skelton, and he left the show with his owner in 2013.

A suite, where Kate is believed to have given birth, is thought to cost closer to £7,500.How much does the baby weigh?The baby weighs 8lbs and 9oz, just two ounces more than his cousin, Prince Louis. In fact, Pippa’s son is heavier than all of his Royal cousins, with George weighing in at 8lbs 6oz and Princess Charlotte at 8lbs 3oz.Until Louis was born, George was the heaviest future king in 100 years, and while Louis has taken that title from his older brother, Pippa’s son can boast that he in turn is heavier than him.Pippa’s son is much heavier than his uncles, with Prince William hitting 7lbs 1.5oz back in 1982 and Prince Harry coming in at 6lbs 14oz in 1984.What will the baby be called?No name has been announced so far, but a couple of the names Pippa and her husband James could go for are their father’s names: Michael and David respectively.Who is Pippa Middleton’s husband James Matthews?Pippa’s husband is the financier James Matthews. They married in May 2016.

Pregnant...Share this article    Prince Harry has ignored the torrential rain to deliver an inspiring speech dedicated to Australia\u0027s struggling farmers          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park on Wednesday afternoon where a huge crowd had turned out to see the royal couple           The couple\u0027s trip to central New South Wales drew  came just days after the announcement that Meghan (pictured) is pregnant          An excited crowd of 15,000 locals turned out to get up close and personal with the royal couple in the wake of their pregnancy announcement \u0027Sixty-four years ago my grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were right here visiting all of you. It\u0027s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western plains region since then,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech at Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park.  \u0027Coming here brings back memories of 2003 when I spent some time on a small 16,000 hectare property in Roma in Queensland chasing cows through the bush... and it was great - I perfected the great Aussie salute.\u0027The greatest part about visiting country Australia is the people. You are the salt to of the earth: honest, hardworking and as tough as they come. That resilience, sense of humour and commitment to the land are what make you unique.\u0027You are the backbone of this country.\u0027 To laughter from the crowd, the drenched prince said: \u0027Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.\u0027You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.\u0027Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, in reference to the devastating drought.\u0027It must be hard not to lose hope when you endure so many dry months knowing you are powerless to do anything about it,\u0027 the Duke of Sussex said.\u0027The rich traditions of the Australian outback are legendary. You have a lot to be proud of. But I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.\u0027And despite welcome rain it\u0027s going to take a lot more and a long time to recover. \u0027People in many farming communities generally don\u0027t feed themselves before they need, they are often more isolated, social networks are smaller and there is still a stigma surrounding mental health.          Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, mentioning the devastating drought          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were gifted a boomerang after his speech during the couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo          Prince Harry pretends to throw a boomerang gifted to him after his speech in Dubbo, in regional New South Wales          Prince Harry tries to encourage a jumping dog to scale a wall during his visit to Dubbo          Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall\u0027We know that suicide rates in rural and remote areas are greater than in urban populations and this may especially be true among young men in remote regions.\u0027But outside all of that, here\u0027s what I also know. You are one huge community and with that comes an unparalleled level of internal support and understanding.   \u0027All you need to do is ask for it... chances are they may well be suffering too, and will relish the opportunity to either listen or talk themselves. You need to know a part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it. You must not silently suffer.\u0027If I may speak personally, we are all in this together, because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better.\u0027Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity.\u0027Your culture of mateship and reputation for looking out for each other ensures that when people are ready to ask for help they will be heard.\u0027          Prince Harry said the royal couple have been \u0027impressed and inspired\u0027 by stories of Australians rallying together to help one another during adversity          The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional clapping sticks offered by dignitaries through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager          Prince Harry and Meghan visit the Clontarf Foundation and Girls Academy at Dubbo College during the couple\u0027s royal tourHe said the couple had enjoyed their time in Dubbo, known as the \u0027city of smiles\u0027.\u0027Dubbo, I am told is now a popular tourist destination renowned for its zoo, festivals, boutique wineries and the old Dubbo jail. \u0027The quality of lives and shared values of people here in rural and regional Australia are very special.\u0027 Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall – before meeting members of Team Rubicon, an organisation for veterans which uses disaster response to help former service people back into civilian life.The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional Aboriginal clapping sticks offered by dignitaries, through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager designed for their visit.Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftPrince Harry and Meghan receive a warm welcome in MelbournePrince Harry and Meghan Markle touchdown in MelbourneKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakePolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorPrince Harry and Meghan admire Aboriginal street art in MelbourneMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboPolice arrive at Saudi consul\u0027s residence to search premisesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs    Five-year-old Luke Vincent managed to stroke Prince Harry\u0027s beard after the royal arrived in Dubbo, stealing the show after the royal couple shook hands with every single student on the tarmac          Luke, who was among schoolchildren who greeted the royal couple at Dubbo Airport on Wednesday morning, received a hug from Prince Harry           The kindergarten student had waited at the very end of the line to met the royal couple who are spending Wednesday in the regional city of Dubbo\u0027We gave him a can of special brew,\u0027 said Peter West, 62, from the city.\u0027It\u0027s a mixture from her town in America and his in England.\u0027It\u0027s beautiful.

Luke\u0027s favourite person in the world is Santa Claus, who has a beard. So he rubbed Harry\u0027s beard,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s been a wonderful experience for these little country kids to meet people they\u0027ve only ever seen on TV.\u0027            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a new best friend when they touched down in the drought-stricken regional city          The Duke and Duchess spent time with Luke after they arrived in Dubbo for the second full day of their Australian tour           The royal couple were visibly delighted to meet with five-year-old Luke during their tour of Dubbo in Wednesday           The youngster, who was sporting green glasses and a checkered cap with his school uniform, had also handed the Duchess of Sussex a bouquet of flowers          Luke\u0027s school uploaded a picture of the youngster travelling on the bus on the way to meet the royal couple at the airportForecast rain held off while the children jumped up and down with anticipation, cheering as the couple came down the steps from their RAAF jet for the second full day of their royal tour.Despite running behind schedule, Harry and Meghan took their time with the school children, the Prince bouncing around energetically and Meghan kneeling down to speak to them.Ms Van Dartel said of the royal couple\u0027s visit to Dubbo, whose farming community has been hit by the devastating drought in recent months: \u0027This is a real morale boost\u0027.James Fogg, 11, from Eumungerie Public School, which has just nine pupils, told Harry he wanted to be a helicopter pilot, with the Duke replying: \u0027Good choice, good man\u0027. \u0027This is so exciting for Dubbo.

Prince Harry was wearing a grey-blue shirt and trousers. Also in the line-up was Troy Grant MP, the member for Dubbo and minister for police and emergency services, and his wife Toni.Previous royal visitors to Dubbo have included Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1920, the Queen in 1954 and 1992 and Prince Edward in 2006.   The farming region got barely any rain through the winter and has been blighted by temperatures in excess of 45C leading to the death of thousands of cattle, loss of livelihood and severe food shortages. Some areas have experienced the driest spell since records began in 1900. Prince Harry and Meghan  visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service after their arrival to learn more about the life-saving role the aviation service provides for people living in remote areas.   There, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a hero medic who pulled three survivors from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceMarcus Wilson, 47, an ex-soldier who was running a medical service at the time, was awarded Australia\u0027s Bravery Medal for his actions. Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftPrince Harry and Meghan receive a warm welcome in MelbournePrince Harry and Meghan Markle touchdown in MelbourneKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakePolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorPrince Harry and Meghan admire Aboriginal street art in MelbourneMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboPolice arrive at Saudi consul\u0027s residence to search premisesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbsThe couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance \u0027is going straight to the pool room\u0027.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

Prince Harry takes Meghan (and his Akubra) to rural Australia – 15 years after he spent his gap year working on a remote stationBy Kylie Stevens for Daily Mail Australia Prince Harry and The Duchess of Sussex have touched down for some fresh country air in rural Australia, bringing their Akubras with them to fit in with the locals.But the prince is no stranger to donning the iconic Australian hat.Their whirlwind visit to Dubbo in central New South Wales on Wednesday brings back vivid memories Prince Harry has of his time in country Australia 15 years ago.          Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.

He is pictured here in 2008\u0027Playing Big Bird is one of the most joyous things of my life,\u0027 Spinney told the New York Times last week. \u0027I always thought, how fortunate for me that I got to play the two best Muppets?\u0027 But the time has come for Spinney to hang up the suit for good. Spinney had to stop puppeteering for Big Bird in 2015 due to the physical requirements that come with handling a full body costume for an 8ft 2in bird.  He began to develop problems with his balance, and thus for the last three years has only been recording the voices for Big Bird and Oscar. With Sesame Street\u0027s 50th anniversary on the horizon - for which his final voice recordings will be used - Spinney felt it was the right time to say goodbye.          It has been an incredible television career for Spinney, who first caught the eye of Muppets creator Jim Henson back in the early 1960s          The pair met at a puppeteering conference and Henson asked Spinney to join the Muppeteers and perform on the very first season of Sesame Street Spinney first became interested in puppeteering when he was just a five-year-old watching a performance of Three Little Kittens. Three years later he bought a monkey puppet in a yard sale and began putting on his own shows, eventually using the Punch and Judy puppet his mom bought him one Christmas. Spinney continued to puppeteer throughout his adolescence, putting on shows to help save money for college.But after graduating from high school, Spinney joined the US Air Force. Upon his return, he spent nearly a decade puppeteering for a show in Boston and working as an animator. Spinney first met Henson at a puppet festival in 1962. Their paths crossed again in 1969, at another puppeteer festival in Salt Lake City.           Spinney won children\u0027s hearts with both the cranky Oscar the Grouch and the lovable Big Bird          Spinney can be seen here in the 1970s, chatting with Henson while playing Oscar for a sceneHenson was in the audience as Spinney tried to put on a multimedia show with both live actors and puppets, a faulty spotlight washing out his animated background. Still, Henson was impressed. After the show he went up to Spinney and said: \u0027I liked what you were trying to do\u0027. He then invited Spinney to join the Muppeteers full-time and revealed that two new characters were being developed for a children\u0027s program called Sesame Street. The rest, they say, is history. Since that fateful day Spinney has played the lovable Big Bird and the cantankerous Oscar, performing them everywhere from Australia and China to Japan and Europe.           Spinney has played the characters everywhere from Australia and China to Japan and Europe          Spinney is pictured here with Oscar the Grouch in 1970, when the character was still orangeIt was Spinney who helped shape Big Bird, originally imagined to be a \u0027 funny, dumb country yokel\u0027. \u0027I said, I think I should play him like he\u0027s a child, a surrogate,\u0027 Spinney recalled telling the producers. Grieving mother whose baby was stillborn one year ago walks...Sunny gays: Sesame Street founder who created Bert and Ernie...Share this article\u0027He can be all the things that children are. He can learn with the kids.\u0027 Sesame Workshop president Jeffrey Dunn credited Spinney with helping shape the beloved character and the long-running children\u0027s series as a whole. \u0027Big Bird has always had the biggest heart on Sesame Street, and that\u0027s Caroll\u0027s gift to us,\u0027 he said.           Sesame Workshop president Jeffrey Dunn credited Spinney with helping shape Big Bird and the long-running children\u0027s series as a whole          Spinney said he feels grateful that he got to play a \u0027six-year-old for 50 years\u0027. He is pictured here on Sesame Street Day in New York City in 2009 \u0027I think it\u0027s fair to say that Caroll\u0027s view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organization.\u0027 Spinney went on to win four Daytime Emmys and two Grammys for his work on the program, as well as a lifetime achievement award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.          Spinney would go on to win four Daytime Emmys and two Grammys for his work on the beloved children\u0027s show Sesame Street would also be responsible for introducing Spinney to his second wife Debra, who had been working at the Children\u0027s Television Workshop when they met in 1972. \u0027I couldn\u0027t believe Big Bird was coming up and talking to me,\u0027 she recalled of the day they met. Big Bird will next be played by Matt Vogel, who has been Spinney\u0027s apprentice since 1996. Vogel, who now also plays Kermit the Frog and Count Van Count, knows that following in Spinney\u0027s footsteps will be \u0027daunting and important\u0027. \u0027The more I do the character, the more that I try to preserve what I think Caroll\u0027s intentions were,\u0027 he said. \u0027Inevitably, part of our own personality starts to creep into those characters. But that\u0027s the way they live on.\u0027 Spinney said he feels grateful that he got to play a \u0027six-year-old for 50 years\u0027. And while he may be hanging up the Big Bird suit for good, Spinney isn\u0027t really saying goodbye. \u0027I don\u0027t get to play him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I get to live his life.\u0027           While he may be hanging up the Big Bird suit for good, Spinney isn\u0027t really saying goodbye. \u0027I don\u0027t get to play him,\u0027 he said. \u0027I get to live his life\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/04/5159E7BC00000578-0-image-a-21_1539661982945.jpg","title":"Samantha Markle says jumping joy Meghan pregnancy announcement","story":"Baby on the way: Meghan Markle\u0027s controversial sister has told DailyMailTV she feels nothing but happiness for the royal couple after learning they are expecting their first child          Supportive sister: Samantha Markle, 53, says she was \u0027jumping for joy\u0027 in her wheelchair after hearing the news and has called for the Markle family to set aside their beef and come together for the new babyThe mom-of-three has previously been one of the most outspoken members of the Markle clan and has made a number of attacks on the Duchess of Sussex in the media over her treatment of their father, Thomas Markle Sr.Less than two weeks ago, she was pictured delivering a letter to Kensington Palace that contained a plea for Meghan to make things up with the retired lighting director, 74.Meghan and her father have not spoken since the royal wedding in May when he was forced to pull out after suffering a heart attack amid a staged paparazzi photo scandal. But Samantha told DailyMailTV that the baby news has changed everything and is now calling for the whole family to stop fighting and unite around her future niece or nephew.  She said: \u0027I think everybody really just needs to come together and realize this is really important and special for Meg, for Harry, for the child, for all of us, and we need to stop the sparring.\u0027I want things to be alright in my family and everybody has to be on the same page.

More than 50,000 retail jobs have already been lost this year.Critics said it was deeply unfair that internet giants such as Amazon and Asos pay very little in business rates because their premises are out-of-town warehouses. Marks and Spencer, for example, paid £184million in business rates last year compared with Amazon’s £14million for British  warehouses.          General view of the online retail giant Amazon\u0027s distribution centre in Swansea, South Wales. Amazon paid just £14million in business rates last year           Amazon workers packing orders on the warehouse floor at the Amazon UK Fulfilment Centre in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. The Chancellor is facing pressure to introduce a so-called ‘Amazon tax’ on the internet giantsThe Chancellor is facing pressure to introduce a so-called ‘Amazon tax’ on the internet giants to try to level the playing field, while some have called for a freeze on business rate rises to give struggling high street stores some relief.Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The Chancellor must provide targeted support to those businesses struggling to keep their heads above water.It’s vital that businesses are given the right support in the form of a rates freeze from April 2019, when the next inflation-linked rise is due.’Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ‘The Chancellor has got to tackle the issue of business rates, which are causing mounting anger, are a tax on business improvement, and create a disadvantage against tax-dodging tech multinationals.’Shops for let in Falmouth - Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher warned that surging property costs are the biggest challenge facing the High StreetUber and Airbnb reveal plans to give out equity after years...Ocado wants to whisk goods through tunnels with Elon...\u0027Panicking\u0027 stores launch sales that could last till...High streets on the brink with more job losses and shop...Share this articleShadow chancellor John McDonnell demanded a crackdown on tax avoidance by Amazon and other online giants. ‘The current business rates system is crippling Britain’s high streets but Philip Hammond is refusing to do anything about it,’ he said. ‘We need action so jobs and local communities don’t continue to suffer.’The Mail is campaigning for reforms that will give bricks-and-mortar stores a level playing field with online rivals.Ministers have been dropping broad hints that Mr Hammond’s Budget at the end of the month will include some reforms to help the High Street.           General view of closed-down shops on Margate High Street, Kent, England - the rise will hit stores of all sizes from corner shops to department chains, as well as manufacturers and white-collar firmsThe 2.4 per cent rates rise, in line with the September inflation figure, means most companies will have to pay 50.5p in the pound, according to analysis by consultants at Altus Group.This would be the first time the 50p threshold has been passed since the tax was introduced in 1990. In the retail industry, this could mean the difference between profit and loss. The rise will hit stores of all sizes from corner shops to department chains, as well as manufacturers and white-collar firms.           General view of boarded up shops on Margate High Street, Kent. A treasury spokesperson said \u0027We’ve appointed an expert panel of industry leaders… to diagnose the issues affecting our high street’It follows a jump in costs after premises were revalued last year to take account of rising property prices. Debenhams boss Sergio Bucher warned that surging property costs are the biggest challenge facing the High Street.Writing for the trade magazine Estates Gazette, he said: ‘While nearly all of our 166 UK stores are profitable today, extrapolate current market trends three to five years forward and that picture is going to change.’John Webber, of property firm Colliers International, said: ‘Further increases are unsustainable. This could impact decisions to either close or keep open stores.’          Closing Down Sale posters are seen in shop windows of store Twenty One in Fleetwood, LancashireRobert Hayton, of Altus, added: ‘Our high streets are engulfed in crisis. It is time for the Chancellor to take a step back and support business through an unprecedented stimulus by freezing rate rises next April.’Mr Hammond faced pressure from his own backbenchers last night, with former Tory chairman Grant Shapps saying: ‘After years of struggle, the High Street deserves a boost and there’s no better place to start than ensuring a business rate-friendly Budget.’Fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘The Chancellor must scrap or curtail business rates for independent shops and they should also get tax breaks.’A spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘We’ve introduced more than £10billion of business rate support to help our high streets, so many bricks-and-mortar businesses now pay no rates at all. \u0027We’ve appointed an expert panel of industry leaders… to diagnose the issues affecting our high streets.’ Town centre that struggles... as nearby online fashion giant thrivesStruggling Barnsley shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant Asos.A few miles outside the South Yorkshire town centre stands the vast warehouse of the retailer that yesterday announced £2.4billion in revenues.While small firms on Barnsley’s dying high street have to pay out large proportions of their takings to cover rising business rates, the thriving online retailer paid only £1.1million for its Grimethorpe site where it employs 4,000 staff.Mark Rayner, manager of Ashworth and Bird men’s clothing shop in Barnsley, said it was impossible to compete with the retail giants: ‘Business is tough, footfall is down and it’s hard to make a profit.           Empty stores in Barnsley, where struggling shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant AsosYet for Julie and Wayne Chalkley, who run the Sofa and Bed Barn shop, staying open is still a challenge.They said: ‘Every day the druggies hang around in the alleyway. They are on spice, there’s fighting and all sorts going on. \u0027They used to go to Poundworld to rob it but that’s closed now. We’ve got nothing nickable and anyway I talk to them but it does put customers off coming.‘Little old ladies are terrified. We need to clean this area up. We had a stabbing a few weeks ago near the market.’Alex Cobham of the Tax Justice Network said: ‘We’re effectively subsidising the likes of Amazon to outcompete shops that create employment on our high streets. We’re undermining our own economy.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/18/01/51670CFA00000578-6288569-She_was_spotted_at_Perth_Airport_wheeling_her_luggage_to_a_waiti-a-35_1539822012331.jpg","title":"Here Harry Meghan Lady Kitty Spencer lands Australia royal couple continue tour","story":"    Lady Kitty Spencer (pictured) has touched down in Australia ahead of a charity event      Australian man sparks royal security scare after BBQ he was...Meg-mania hits Melbourne: Pregnant duchess and Prince Harry...\u0027Pipe down Karl ... are you after a knighthood?\u0027 Piers...Share this articleLady Kitty oozed a casual vibe as she made her way through the airport in an on-trend camouflage jacket, casual grey t-shirt and \u0027boyfriend\u0027 jeans.The royal completed her informal look with a designer red chain bag, a pair of rainbow shoes and black sunglasses - her hair flowing casually over one shoulder.She announced the visit on Instagram earlier in the month, the fundraiser\u0027s website saying she was continuing the legacy of her great aunt, Princess Diana.     Lady Kitty oozed a casual vibe as she made her way through the airport in an on-trend camouflage jacket, casual grey t-shirt and \u0027boyfriend\u0027 jeans          Lady Kitty\u0027s in Australia ahead of Perth\u0027s annual Channel Seven Telethon fundraising eventWhile Lady Kitty is close with cousin Prince Harry, attending his nuptials with Meghan Markle in May, it\u0027s unclear whether they intend to meet up.Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan continue their tour of Australia, departing Sydney for Melbourne on Thursday morning.They\u0027re in town promoting the Invictus Games and due to meet the public in front of Melbourne\u0027s Government House, crowds already building."},{"url":null,"title":"BBC recruit unemployed Jobcente criticism corporation didnt reflect modern Britain","story":"    The BBC will recruit unemployed youngsters through the Jobcentre as it desperately tries to shed its posh image.

She was really genuine.\u0027After a wet and windy start to their time in Sydney the sun was shining for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first public walkabout since they revealed a royal baby is on the way.Around two thousand people packed into the promenade outside the world famous Sydney Opera House as royal well wishers flocked gathered keen to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.Shortly before 1pm Harry and Meghan spent more than their scheduled 20 minutes meeting and greeting the incredibly excited locals as royal baby fever seemed to have already reached fever pitch in the city.But their attention was dedicated to one special fan who has stolen a kiss from Prince Harry on more than one occasion.Daphne Dunne, 98, has been dubbed Prince Harry\u0027s \u0027favourite Aussie\u0027 with the Duke of Sussex stopping to have lengthy chats with her during both his 2015 and 2017 trips to Australia.          The royals climbed aboard a water transfer - Admiral Hudson flying the White ensign of the Royal Australian Navy - after the visit to Taronga Zoo for a 20 minute crossing of the harbour to the Sydney Opera house          After their zoo visit, the couple strolled down a walkway towards Sydney Harbour to take a boat towards from the Man O\u0027War Steps, the landing point for British and Australian fleets for 150 years            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped out in Australia today for the first day of engagements during their tour - which coincided with Meghan announcing she was pregnant. Meghan was seen wearing Diana\u0027s butterfly earrings and bracelet as she and Harry made their way down to the Man O\u0027War steps to take a boat across Sydney Harbour          Meghan and Harry chat as they watch the modern dance inside the Sydney Opera House on the first full day of their Aussie tour          The royal couple watched a rehearsal at the Sydney Opera House of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre, an internationally acclaimed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander modern dance company          Bangarra tour their dance shows across Australia and have also performed in London and New York    Overjoyed: Meghan arriving in Sydney yesterday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced todayPrince Harry is ‘happier than he has ever been’ as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an ‘emotional wreck - but in a good way!’ since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.‘It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn’t be happier. He is so protective of her,’ the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week.Meghan, 37, is understood to have just had her 12-week scan. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie’s wedding. It sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who has made no secret of his desire to start a family.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, toward the end of July, conceived their first child.In the middle of that month, they were on a ‘mini-moon’ royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry’s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.                                                    As they clasped hands Harry, 34, said: \u0027I was looking for you earlier and hoped you\u0027d be here, it\u0027s so good to see you again.\u0027Harry immediately looked round his shoulder and scanned the crowd for his wife, keen to introduce her to his special fan.Soon enough, the Duchess - who had been warmly greeted by hundreds of well wishers congratulating the couple on her pregnancy - approached Ms Dunne, knelt down and hugged her.War widow Daphne\u0027s first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died aged 25 in 1945 during an attack on a Japanese machine gun post in Papua New Guinea.He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry.Meghan said: \u0027I\u0027m so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it\u0027s so lovely you came to see us, thank you.\u0027Daphne said: \u0027It was lovely to meet the Duchess Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I\u0027m so happy he had found happiness, they both deserved the absolute world together.\u0027Asked if this time was the most special meeting her hero Harry, Daphne said: \u0027We\u0027ll it was certainly different. He\u0027s married now for a start and he looks very happy. I am over the moon for him. She is a wonderful girl.\u0027I congratulated them on their baby and said I wished them all the happiness they deserve.\u0027Before leaving, Meghan told her: \u0027Hopefully next time we\u0027ll have our little one with us.\u0027 Other editable locals included sisters Hannah and Francesca Francis, 12 and 10, said they were \u0027super excited\u0027 to meet the Royal couple outside the Opera House.The schoolgirls said they had waited for three hours to just catch a glimpse of the royal couple and \u0027couldn\u0027t believe it\u0027 when the royal couple came over to speak to them.Hannah said: \u0027I told my sister we would see Meghan today but I couldn\u0027t believe it when she came over to speak to us.\u0027She was so nice and friendly and she is so pretty. She was so nice to us and said thank you for coming down to meet her.\u0027Francesca said: \u0027We were both super excited to meet Harry and Meghan I just can\u0027t believe we did.\u0027Our friends are going on be so jealous, we\u0027re going to be taking about this forever.\u0027    Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are seen meeting Ruby a mother Koala who gave birth to koala joey Meghan, named after Her Royal Highness          Prince Harry and his wife the Duchess of Sussex announced on Monday morning they are expecting their first child          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex met the tiny bears named after them when they married in May          Up close and personal: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted stroking the bears at the Taronga Zoo           The Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them          The ten-month old joeys were wedding gifts from the people of NSW for the couple, who got married in May - and just announced they were expecting their own baby          Meghan, showing just a hint of a baby bump, cooed at the koalas before stroking them, saying: \u0027Sweet, cute\u0027 as keeper Suzie MacNamara explained how the animals are threatened in the wild          In front of hundreds of Taronga staff, donors, young volunteers and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (second from left), Meghan used golden scissors to cut a line of green tape to open the centre          After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre          The couple was presented with a koala toy for their new baby - a hastily arranged surprise for the couple after the news of their pregnancy yesterday          Prince Harry - who has previously met koalas - was a tad more irreverent during the meeting          The then walked to the new Taronga Institute of Science and Learning holding hands, inspecting quokkas and wallabies before heading into the koala enclosure    The Duchess seemed very taken by the cuddly furballs and listened intently before asking if she could stroke them          After being invited to pet the echidna, the Duchess tentatively stroked its spines, which are used to track the animals and monitor their diet          The scientific research will allow those tackling the illegal wildlife trade to better pinpoint where animals are coming fromThe Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them.\u0027Taronga Zoo seems to be leading the way.

I\u0027m going to get my wife to come over to say hello,\u0027 he said to Ms Dunne, before introducing his wife to her.\u0027Oh my goodness, is this Daphne? I\u0027m so happy to finally meet you. I\u0027ve heard so much about you - all good things,\u0027 Meghan said as the two women clasped hands. Ms Dunne replied: \u0027It\u0027s wonderful, the two of you\u0027 as she  congratulated the pair on their exciting baby news: \u0027Congratulations, it\u0027s just what Harry needs.\u0027He will be a marvellous dad. He won\u0027t let anything stand in his way and he will be so gentle and loving.\u0027During their heartwarming encounter, Prince Harry noticed something different about Ms Dunne.\u0027Have you dyed your hair a shade of pink?\u0027 he asked, to which she responded \u0027yes\u0027.The royal fan gifted the couple flowers, as Meghan thanked her, adding: \u0027Hopefully next time we see you, we\u0027ll have a little one with us.\u0027       Daphne Dunne has been reunited with Prince Harry, and she got to meet wife Meghan Markle    A blast from the past: The pair reunited on Tuesday (right) after meeting in 2015 (left) and 2017            Ms Dunne (pictured) first met Prince Harry at the Opera House when he visited Sydney in 2015Speaking to AAP following her meet-and-greet with Meghan, Ms Dunne said: \u0027She said she had heard all about me, she\u0027s so beautiful.\u0027Ms Dunne first met the Prince at the Sydney Opera House in  2015 where she nabbed a kiss on the cheek after he noticed the Victoria Cross she wore.Two years later, the pair crossed paths again when they shared a kiss and hug after she waited to meet him in the pouring rain for seven hours with an esky full of beers.Appearing on the Today show on Tuesday  before the meeting, the super royal fan shared her excitement about the prospect of meeting Prince Harry for the third time.\u0027I\u0027m quite excited. I don\u0027t think he has changed very much but I probably have. Seeing my age is going up, up, up,\u0027 she told reporter Sylvia Jeffreys.\u0027He\u0027s a natural. He just loves what he\u0027s doing but seems to fit in with everything he says. I\u0027m very happy for him. I\u0027m glad he\u0027s got a wife now and soon a bubba.\u0027            Prince Harry introduced his wife to Ms Dunne, who waited to meet the couple with flowers            Meghan told Ms Dunne that she hopes the next time they meet again, she would see their baby            Beautiful moment! Ms Dunne was overjoyed when she got to see her Prince again on TuesdaySpeaking fondly about the Prince, Ms Dunne told Sunrise: \u0027Harry is just wonderful, you couldn\u0027t describe him any other way.\u0027I have to meet Meghan because she and Harry are really in love, you can see it coming out of their eyes and out of their hearts too.\u0027Weighing in on the baby joy, Ms Dunne said: \u0027I\u0027m thrilled for them, especially Harry because I know how he wanted a baby, now he\u0027s got his wish.\u0027She added that Prince Harry will be a \u0027hands on\u0027 father when the baby arrives.Reminiscing their heartwarming encounter, Ms Dunne told the Today show a selfless Prince Harry seemed unfazed when he braved the rain to talk to her in May 2015.\u0027He didn\u0027t worry about, he just continued on with what he was doing, which was talking to me,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027When he started to go, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. And when he came back later, he gave me another one because I was lopsided, and I had to have another kiss to put me right.\u0027When asked where the third kiss will go, Ms Dunne laughed as she responded: \u0027I don\u0027t know, I might not even get one.\u0027       Thomas Markle, the father of the Duchess of Sussex has said he believes she will be a \u0027great mom\u0027 - but his daughter did not tell him she is pregnant            Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next Spring            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed that  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland knew about the pregnancy and was said to be \u0027very happy\u0027. Thomas was not mentioned.  \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted. He heard the news before it was made public and was overjoyed. He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. A royal disaster! Prince Harry (left) was targeted by serial prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler (right) during his Australian tour with wife Meghan Markle on TuesdayOn Tuesday,  footage of Pete\u0027s encounter with Meghan and Harry was posted to The Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show\u0027s official Instagram account.\u0027Bit of royal mingling! Wait til you hear what Prince Harry said to crush Intern Pete\u0027s ego,\u0027 the caption teased.But fans didn\u0027t have to wait long, as another video was soon uploaded that revealed Harry\u0027s dry-witted response.    \u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry!\u0027 As Meghan and Harry arrived at the Sydney Opera House to meet their Australian fans, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement and began shouting at themAs Meghan and Harry approached the crowd of fans awaiting their arrival at the Opera House, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement.\u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry! I talk to you every year!\u0027 he breathlessly shouted.But Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027.Unfortunately, Pete didn\u0027t take the hint and awkwardly reminded the visiting royal that they had actually met \u0027a few times\u0027 before.             \u0027I talk to you every year!\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition when Intern Pete (pictured) reminded him they\u0027d met beforehand, and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027            \u0027You behave today!\u0027 Meanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027            \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot LavaMeanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete  and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027.In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot Lava.The game requires players to escape the floor by climbing on a surface within five seconds of someone yelling \u0027the floor is lava\u0027.Harry awkwardly laughed as Pete repeatedly shouted \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at him from behind a barricade. It was clear during the exchange that Harry had absolutely no idea what Intern Pete was talking about.   \u0027I\u0027ve longed for kids since I was very, very young\u0027: Heart-melting pictures that prove mischievous Harry was born to be a dadTrust Harry to cheer us up on a grey and fractious news day. Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010In 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd.

When congratulated by the media on their happy news, Harry smiled shyly and said \u0027thanks\u0027. They also accepted good wishes from dignitaries including the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP. \u0027Thank you, that\u0027s very kind,\u0027 said Meghan.

And thank you very much for organising the weather! Let\u0027s hope the rain stays off!\u0027 The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.

The visiting royals doesn\u0027t change that remotely. Watch this space,\u0027 he tweeted.FitzSimons, and others in his camp, insist the reason the royals are popular is not because they are members of the constitutional monarchy but because they are tiara-wearing celebrities who have extravagant weddings. In other words, Harry and Meghan\u0027s celebrity status is what draws the crowds, rather than any loyalty to the monarchy itself. A new poll released on Monday backed up that claim, showing 52 per cent of Australians support the country becoming a republic, with only 22 per cent supporting the monarchy.           Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex meet members of the public during a walk about outside the Opera House in Sydney, AustraliaSupport for dropping the British monarch as Australia\u0027s head of state was strongest among those aged 25 to 34, while those aged over 65 were happiest to keep on with the status quo, the poll by ResearchNow found.  Dr Giselle Bastin, a royal expert at Flinders University in South Australia, said the young royals\u0027 social activism was what gained them support among the younger generation who are not loyal to the monarchy.Both Harry and Meghan champion the environment, education, public health and Indigenous rights - while Meghan is renowned for her ardent feminism.\u0027I think young people might be a bit indifferent about where royalty sits in terms of our constitution,\u0027 Dr Giselle told Hack.\u0027In some ways it suggests to me that the royals have gone beyond constitutional monarchy. \u0027They have certain interests and you\u0027ll find those interests are ones that align with many young people\u0027s interests... they engage the hearts and minds of the young.\u0027           The Australian tour has kicked into full swing for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex with a sea of supporters gathering at each spot they visited          Prince Harry is embraced by 97-year-old Dafney Dunne during he and Meghan\u0027s walk outside the Opera House in Sydney, Australia          People hold posters of Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and wife Meghan as the Royal couple visit SydneyAustralian republicans have been pushing to ditch the monarchy since before their country was federated in 1901.They narrowly lost the last referendum in 1998 because the republican vote was split on the method proposed for selection of a president.Many commentators say it is likely the republicans will push for another vote not too long after the Princes Charles takes the throne. Meghan masters the art of the tour wardrobe!

I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.   \u0027I had had a chance to live my life.

Kate Woodley said the farm had “barely any rain for seven or eight months”. They moved on to Dubbo’s Victoria Park where The Duke of Sussex praised Dubbo’s resistance and hardiness in dealing with recent hard droughts in a speech as the rains poured in the city.Harry joked “I’ve got my wife” as he was offered an umbrella before taking to the lectern at , as Meghan provided shelter from his side.He also quipped that the “rain was a gift” as hundreds of people from the region had turned out to see the royal visitors.The much-needed rain began to fall about 10 minutes before their arrival and only got worse as they saw stalls at the picnic in Victoria Park.He said: “Sixty-four years ago my grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, were right here visiting the war memorial.“So it’s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western Plains region since then.”Addressing the crowd, he said: “You people are the salt of the earth, hard working and as tough as they come.“I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.”To laughter from the crowd, he said: “Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.“You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.”Harry and Meghan began their visit by watching a display of jumping dogs – with the Duke trying his hand at beckoning a canine over a wall – before meeting members of Team Rubicon, an organisation for veterans which uses disaster response to help former servicepeople back into civilian life.The couple received an array of gifts during their visit, from traditional clapping sticks offered by dignitaries through to a can of Dubbo Royale lager.“We gave him a can of special brew,” said Peter West, 62, from the city.“It’s a mixture from her town in America and his in England.“It’s beautiful. We bought a slab to take home but we had a few waiting here this morning.”  Meghan was glowing as Prince Harry waved to the wellwishers who had turned out at Dubbo airport to greet the couple           The Duke and Duchess met with local schoolchildren who had lined-up to see the couple arrive at Dubbo airport           Prince Harry meets with the local schoolchildren after stepping off the Royal Australian Air Force plane from Sydney          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceGirl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftPrince Harry and Meghan receive a warm welcome in MelbournePrince Harry and Meghan Markle touchdown in MelbourneKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakePolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorPrince Harry and Meghan admire Aboriginal street art in MelbourneMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboPolice arrive at Saudi consul\u0027s residence to search premisesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs      Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are pictured boarding a plane at Sydney Airport, bound for Dubbo            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were each holding an Akubra hat which had been gifted to them by the Governor-General of Australia and his wife a day earlier  Getting some tips, Harry?

She\u0027s normally in bed at 10.30am but we had to stay up for this.

The stone came from the same mine in Senhora De Lima’s native Brazil which has provided aquamarines for the Queen.It was not just Diana who enjoyed a special link with the generous Lucia, so too did William and Harry.

Pregnant...Share this articleIf it was money, it was often a £50 note. ‘Ooh, a pink Granny,’ the boys would exclaim excitedly, a reference to the Queen’s head on the banknote.Harry never forgot such kindness and, when he and William were making their plans for a statue of their mother as a permanent memorial, they sought the views of Sra De Lima.Sadly, she died last year before the project could be completed. But both boys knew how much she meant to their mother during the years she was in London as the wife of Brazil’s ambassador to the UK, and later in Washington when he was appointed envoy to the U.S.Diana would often talk to Lucia and other friends of her ‘precious boys’ — but particularly of Harry. She adored them both but William, destined to be King, was marked from birth for special attention.As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry. ‘I have to,’ she would often tell me. ‘Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amounts of our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William.’            Princess Diana meets 91-year-old Nellie Corbett at the Lord Gage Centre in NewhamOne day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother, with whom the Princess had always had an ambivalent relationship.Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. ‘It’s not fair,’ Harry told his mother.Diana took it up with the Queen Mother explaining, as delicately as possible, that she would prefer it if she didn’t show favouritism to William. For her part, the Queen Mother argued that as William was heir to the throne he should be groomed as such. However, things did change a little. More than anything Diana didn’t want Harry to have a complex about his position in the family.She need not have worried, although slower at learning than William and more sensitive, Harry was a happy-go-lucky boy with a streak of curiosity.William, on the other hand, was slightly aloof, and this made him a little more serious and retiring.Diana empathised with her eldest son’s predicament. ‘He doesn’t want his every move watched,’ Diana would say.Whereas Harry’s attributes, she felt, were better suited for royal duty. She came up with the nickname Good King Harry, GKH for short, which she shared with a handful of friends.How Harry loved it when he was alone with Diana at Kensington Palace. Once, when home ill from boarding school, he gleefully told one of Diana’s friends: ‘I have got Mummy to myself . . . and I don’t have to share her with William!’Quite how many of his childhood memories from the Palace nursery Harry will recall as he becomes a father himself, remains to be seen. But there is one quality he is bound to want to replicate. Diana ensured that the domestic staff and police referred to the boys only by their first names, not as ‘Prince’ and never as ‘Your Royal Highness’.Says her friend Simone Simmons: ‘She knew they need to have a little dose of reality.’Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftPrince Harry and Meghan receive a warm welcome in MelbournePrince Harry and Meghan Markle touchdown in MelbourneKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakePolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorPrince Harry and Meghan admire Aboriginal street art in MelbourneMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboPolice arrive at Saudi consul\u0027s residence to search premisesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs  Princess Diana in Vancouver, Canada (left) and the Duchess of Sussex in Sydney on Tuesday She smothered them in love and tried to give them an education outside the classroom — hence those visits to the homeless and the sick during their childhood.But for all her efforts how heart-breaking it was to hear Harry recall last year of the times after his parents’ break-up when ‘we never saw our mother enough or we never saw our father enough’.All the same, Diana considered motherhood to be her greatest achievement. As the years pass it is harder and harder to visualise the beautiful young woman who died at 36 as a grandmother four times over, but how she’d have loved to have imparted some of her wisdom to the women who married her sons.She would, of course, have understood Kate’s wish to have her own capable mother, Carole Middleton, on hand for the arrivals of George, Charlotte and Louis, and installed as ‘Granny Number One’.But it may have been impossible to keep her out of the nurseryafter Meghan gave birth. For Harry will be fulfilling a desire his mother once held — becoming parent to a mixed-race child.Diana’s dream was to have a baby with Hasnat Khan, the kindly Pakistan-born heart surgeon with whom she fell in love after watching him operate at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital.And if it was a girl so much the better. For Diana this was no idle fantasy. She believed a child with Muslim Khan could have far-reaching implications for the world. It would help, she reasoned, bring the Muslim and Christian worlds closer together.Girl bursts into tears of joy after receiving a hug from Prince HarryEx-swingers club owner shows off house that Emile Cilliers visitedJean-Claude Juncker greets Theresa May with a kissEmile Cilliers daughter struggles to cope with him having leftPrince Harry and Meghan receive a warm welcome in MelbournePrince Harry and Meghan Markle touchdown in MelbourneKarl Stefanovic slams Piers Morgan for calling Meghan Markle fakePolice is at Westfield shopping centre after man fell from top floorPrince Harry and Meghan admire Aboriginal street art in MelbourneMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboPolice arrive at Saudi consul\u0027s residence to search premisesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle get acquainted with Aussie herbs      With them in spirit: The Duchess wears Diana’s butterfly earrings at a Sydney reception            Honour the memory: Meghan also wore Diana\u0027s golden bracelet during the trip to AustraliaIt is tempting to wonder also how Diana would have handled the tragedy of Meghan’s father, the shock of his collusion with a photographer prior to the wedding, the embarrassing interviews and his isolation from his daughter.She treasured her own father and despite several significant differences, they never fell out. When Earl Spencer died suddenly at 68 in 1992, she was heartbroken and many have wondered if his absence helped precipitate her split from Charles that year.Her friends believe Diana would have been on the first flight for a rendezvous with Thomas Markle at his Mexican border hideaway to broker a reconciliation.In many ways, Meghan is the young woman Diana yearned to be, whose successes and achievements she earned for herself, not through marriage into the Royal Family. Despite the global fame it brought her, it was only after her split from Charles that she found a way to use that celebrity and turn it into a meaningful role.But no role would surely have surpassed that of grandmother.   Backups for every piece and detailed plans well in advance: Former royal maid reveals how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the tourShe has already wowed fans around the world with two outfit changes on the first official day of the royal tour.But it\u0027s not just the dresses that will be scrutinised over the coming 16 days, but every piece the Duchess of Sussex wears - from an artfully-placed folder to an item of jewellery that originally belonged to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Former royal lady\u0027s maid, Alicia Healey, recently revealed how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the Invictus Games tour, and just how much preparation went into planning this event.

In her engagement photoshoot, she wore a custom-made Ralph and Russo gown.Then, later on in April, the Duchess opted for a Camilla and Marc black blazer with a cross-body bag by Oroton for the Commonwealth Youth Forum reception.She followed this with an ivory shift dress by Sydney-based designer, Karen Gee, on the first official day of the royal tour, promptly causing the website to crash.             Ms Healey is also a fan of the the Dior outfit that marked the Centenary of the RAF (pictured with Prince Harry)If Ms Healey could see the 37-year-old royal do one thing across the 76 official engagements over 16 days, she said she would love to see Meghan in less black and more colour.She said that while she too loves black, royals \u0027traditionally\u0027 wear plenty of colour in order to help them to stand out from the public, and wearing colour does this.Meghan did opt for a pop of colour, by way of her forest green Brandon Maxwell dress at an afternoon reception at Admiralty House on Tuesday.Finally, the former lady\u0027s maid highlighted her favourite looks worn by the Duchess of Sussex so far, which include the black Givenchy dress worn at the Royal Academy recently and the Dior outfit that marked the Centenary of the RAF.Alicia Healey runs a popular Instagram account documenting royal style, called The Lady\u0027s Maid.

He was previously named as part of the 15-strong \u0027hit squad\u0027 that was reportedly sent to Istanbul to take out Khashoggi.Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, who previously worked as a diplomat at the Saudi embassy in London, has been photographed with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on recent trips to Madrid and Paris, as well as the United States, The New York Times has revealed.Kushner, 37, and the crown prince, known as MBS, 33, have been in close contact throughout the Trump administration.The Saudis have made deals to buy billions in U.S. armaments, something President Donald Trump brought up as the kind of thing he would not want to compromise through U.S. sanctions.          Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is the key power inside Saudi Arabia, and struck up a friendship with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner in 2017.

One source told the paper it was “insane” how much they communicated. Kushner has argued that MBS is a reformer on internal issues, such as allowing women to drive cars, and could be an asset on Middle East peace, as well as a counter to Iran (In May, Trump announced the U.S. was withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran that he calls \u0027horrible.\u0027)Trump spoke defended the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship in an interview on Fox Business Channel Tuesday. \u0027I hope that the king and the crown prince didn\u0027t know about it.

He is pictured here in 2008\u0027Playing Big Bird is one of the most joyous things of my life,\u0027 Spinney told the New York Times last week. \u0027I always thought, how fortunate for me that I got to play the two best Muppets?\u0027 But the time has come for Spinney to hang up the suit for good. Spinney had to stop puppeteering for Big Bird in 2015 due to the physical requirements that come with handling a full body costume for an 8ft 2in bird.  He began to develop problems with his balance, and thus for the last three years has only been recording the voices for Big Bird and Oscar. With Sesame Street\u0027s 50th anniversary on the horizon - for which his final voice recordings will be used - Spinney felt it was the right time to say goodbye.          It has been an incredible television career for Spinney, who first caught the eye of Muppets creator Jim Henson back in the early 1960s          The pair met at a puppeteering conference and Henson asked Spinney to join the Muppeteers and perform on the very first season of Sesame Street Spinney first became interested in puppeteering when he was just a five-year-old watching a performance of Three Little Kittens. Three years later he bought a monkey puppet in a yard sale and began putting on his own shows, eventually using the Punch and Judy puppet his mom bought him one Christmas. Spinney continued to puppeteer throughout his adolescence, putting on shows to help save money for college.But after graduating from high school, Spinney joined the US Air Force. Upon his return, he spent nearly a decade puppeteering for a show in Boston and working as an animator. Spinney first met Henson at a puppet festival in 1962. Their paths crossed again in 1969, at another puppeteer festival in Salt Lake City.           Spinney won children\u0027s hearts with both the cranky Oscar the Grouch and the lovable Big Bird          Spinney can be seen here in the 1970s, chatting with Henson while playing Oscar for a sceneHenson was in the audience as Spinney tried to put on a multimedia show with both live actors and puppets, a faulty spotlight washing out his animated background. Still, Henson was impressed. After the show he went up to Spinney and said: \u0027I liked what you were trying to do\u0027. He then invited Spinney to join the Muppeteers full-time and revealed that two new characters were being developed for a children\u0027s program called Sesame Street. The rest, they say, is history. Since that fateful day Spinney has played the lovable Big Bird and the cantankerous Oscar, performing them everywhere from Australia and China to Japan and Europe.           Spinney has played the characters everywhere from Australia and China to Japan and Europe          Spinney is pictured here with Oscar the Grouch in 1970, when the character was still orangeIt was Spinney who helped shape Big Bird, originally imagined to be a \u0027 funny, dumb country yokel\u0027. \u0027I said, I think I should play him like he\u0027s a child, a surrogate,\u0027 Spinney recalled telling the producers. Grieving mother whose baby was stillborn one year ago walks...Sunny gays: Sesame Street founder who created Bert and Ernie...Share this article\u0027He can be all the things that children are.

Spinney would go on to win four Daytime Emmys and two Grammys for his work on the beloved children\u0027s show Sesame Street would also be responsible for introducing Spinney to his second wife Debra, who had been working at the Children\u0027s Television Workshop when they met in 1972. \u0027I couldn\u0027t believe Big Bird was coming up and talking to me,\u0027 she recalled of the day they met. Big Bird will next be played by Matt Vogel, who has been Spinney\u0027s apprentice since 1996. Vogel, who now also plays Kermit the Frog and Count Van Count, knows that following in Spinney\u0027s footsteps will be \u0027daunting and important\u0027. \u0027The more I do the character, the more that I try to preserve what I think Caroll\u0027s intentions were,\u0027 he said. \u0027Inevitably, part of our own personality starts to creep into those characters.

More than 50,000 retail jobs have already been lost this year.Critics said it was deeply unfair that internet giants such as Amazon and Asos pay very little in business rates because their premises are out-of-town warehouses. Marks and Spencer, for example, paid £184million in business rates last year compared with Amazon’s £14million for British  warehouses.

In the retail industry, this could mean the difference between profit and loss. The rise will hit stores of all sizes from corner shops to department chains, as well as manufacturers and white-collar firms.           General view of boarded up shops on Margate High Street, Kent.

This could impact decisions to either close or keep open stores.’          Closing Down Sale posters are seen in shop windows of store Twenty One in Fleetwood, LancashireRobert Hayton, of Altus, added: ‘Our high streets are engulfed in crisis. It is time for the Chancellor to take a step back and support business through an unprecedented stimulus by freezing rate rises next April.’Mr Hammond faced pressure from his own backbenchers last night, with former Tory chairman Grant Shapps saying: ‘After years of struggle, the High Street deserves a boost and there’s no better place to start than ensuring a business rate-friendly Budget.’Fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘The Chancellor must scrap or curtail business rates for independent shops and they should also get tax breaks.’A spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘We’ve introduced more than £10billion of business rate support to help our high streets, so many bricks-and-mortar businesses now pay no rates at all. \u0027We’ve appointed an expert panel of industry leaders… to diagnose the issues affecting our high streets.’ Town centre that struggles... as nearby online fashion giant thrivesStruggling Barnsley shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant Asos.A few miles outside the South Yorkshire town centre stands the vast warehouse of the retailer that yesterday announced £2.4billion in revenues.While small firms on Barnsley’s dying high street have to pay out large proportions of their takings to cover rising business rates, the thriving online retailer paid only £1.1million for its Grimethorpe site where it employs 4,000 staff.Mark Rayner, manager of Ashworth and Bird men’s clothing shop in Barnsley, said it was impossible to compete with the retail giants: ‘Business is tough, footfall is down and it’s hard to make a profit.           Empty stores in Barnsley, where struggling shopkeepers facing crippling rate hikes yesterday told of their struggle to survive while business is booming for their neighbour – online clothing giant AsosYet for Julie and Wayne Chalkley, who run the Sofa and Bed Barn shop, staying open is still a challenge.They said: ‘Every day the druggies hang around in the alleyway.

Especially clean today?\u0027Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.\u0027A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years.

I don’t want to freak her out.\u0027Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it.\u0027Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush?\u0027 asked the Duke.\u0027Yes, but we can’t eat it in the same way,\u0027 replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.The couple were presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experience, but did not wear them.          At a private lunch, the royal couple enjoyed a shared entree of mushroom and quinoa nest and chargrilled kangaroo and main courses of wild boar, saffron risotto and barramundi          A natural foodie, Duchess Meghan was in her element and encouraged to try the \u0027touch, taste and smell\u0027 experienceSpeaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: \u0027We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them.\u0027I’m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, but if they leave here with a work ethic, it’s a win for us.\u0027Charcoal Lane currently employs 23 young people for 15 hours a week as they work towards a Certificate II in hospitality.\u0027A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,\u0027 said Greg. The Duke and Duchess’ visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area’s indigenous heritage.He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy.Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter.          Thousands of royal fans have gathered at Melbourne\u0027s Royal Botanic Gardens, braving what was a slightly rainy morning          \u0027You are going to get me in trouble,\u0027 India Brown (pictured) says the Prince told her after a protocol-breaking hugMission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: \u0027It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia’s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they’ve met and served royalty!\u0027At Charcoal Lane, we are passionate about celebrating Aboriginal history and providing students with a culturally safe space to express their inidual identities and overcome any challenges they may face on their journey to employment. Our program not only provides training and real work for young locals, but also fosters a sense of cultural and community pride which we are proud to have shared with Their Royal Highnesses.\u0027We also encourage locals and visitors to Melbourne to make a reservation at Charcoal Lane – there are not many places you can say you ate the same meal as the royal couple while also making a social difference.\u0027 After their lunch, they hopped on a tram and are making their way to South Melbourne beach, where they\u0027ll clean up litter with local school children.  The couple started their day with a walkabout through Melbourne\u0027s Royal Botanic Gardens, where thousands turned out to catch a glimpse of the couple          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked up the driveway to meet the public before heading into Government House          One man was led away by police in handcuffs after being apprehended behind barriers at the Royal Botanic GardensThe couple have two further engagements that cannot be announced in advance for security reasons, but will later enjoy a trip on an iconic Melbourne tram to South Melbourne beach.It\u0027s likely to be a shiny new carriage fit for a king, or at least sixth-in-line-to-the-throne.At the beach, they will join volunteers and school children from the local BeachPatrol group.Their Royal Highnesses will learn about efforts to keep Port Phillip Bay beaches and foreshores clear of litter to reduce the negative impact on the marine environment.

What she uncovered, involving ‘serial’ offences by some MPs, is shocking. In a damning indictment of life at Westminster, Dame Laura pulls no punches, describing ‘a culture, cascading from the top down, of deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence, in which bullying, harassment and sexual harassment have been able to thrive and have long been tolerated and concealed.’MPs manspread their thighs to hide the gaps: QUENTIN LETTS...Tory MP Craig Mackinlay\u0027s 2015 election win \u0027would have been...Share this articleWe owe it to all those brave people who came forward not to sweep this under the carpet. Which is why you would expect Labour — with its long and honourable history of fighting for gender equality and the protection of employees — to be in the vanguard of those calling for the resignation of the Speaker.He is the one who has presided over this abusive culture, and is even now trying to cling on to office by hinting that he will step down quietly ... next year.It must be added that Mr Bercow himself has been accused of bullying staff — an allegation he firmly denies.          Ms Hoey accuses Mr Bercow, pictured, of presiding over the abusive culture and has even faced accusations of bullying staff, which he strongly denies If these allegations in Dame Laura’s report — including the groping of female staff — were made about staff in a private company, my colleagues on the Labour benches, normally so keen on women’s rights, would be clamouring for the chief executive’s head ... before breakfast. This is the party that likes to call itself progressive, even though it has never had a female leader, while the Conservatives have had two women Prime Ministers.So did Labour demand immediate action when the Speaker granted an urgent question on this matter in the Commons on Tuesday? Well, no. While female Tory MPs angrily called for Mr Bercow to step down, some Labour MPs, including Dame Margaret Beckett — a member of the Committee on Standards in Public Life — and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry seemed anxious to ensure his survival.Emily Thornberry said later on Sky News: ‘I think this is absolutely not the time to be changing Speaker.’The reason for such pusillanimity from Labour’s ranks of feminists became plain when Margaret Beckett admitted: ‘If it comes to it ... the most difficult decision we’ve made for hundreds of years trumps bad behaviour.’ She was of course referring to Brexit — which is the real reason the Speaker was let off the hook.          Ms Hoey criticised her fellow Labour MP Emily Thornberry, pictured, who believes Mr Bercow should remain in post until after Brexit For he is the pro-Remain controller of parliamentary business, and that means they are willing to ignore the blindingly obvious — that this discredited occupant of one of the highest offices in the land must go. And go now.The Speaker is meant to be a neutral figure, conducting business free of party political taint. As William Lenthall, a holder of that office, explained to Charles I: ‘May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me.’But Mr Bercow’s pedigree as a Remainer is undisputed — witness the sticker affixed to a car occupying his personal parking space earlier this year proclaiming ‘B*****KS TO BREXIT’. Indeed, he made no secret of his Remain sympathies while speaking to students back in 2017.He is, of course, entitled to his personal views, but as Speaker not only should he be impartial, he must be seen to be impartial. Betty Boothroyd, in my view a great Speaker, would never have allowed herself to get caught up in this kind of controversy. She put Parliamentary dignity before her own ego.We are now entering the closing scenes of the protracted and tortuous drama that is the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. After years of behind-closed-doors negotiations in Brussels and in Cabinet, Parliament is about to take centre stage.The role of Speaker will be central in this closing act, and his or her decisions matter. But the idea that Mr Bercow is uniquely qualified for this role through experience is ridiculous: all the Deputy Speakers are perfectly capable of taking over.          She also criticised Dame Margaret Beckett for her failure to call for Mr Bercow\u0027s resignationWith the publication of Dame Laura’s report on harassment and abuse in Parliament, we are beginning the cleansing of the Augean stables. The document makes sometimes painful reading: several offenders were named repeatedly by those who gave evidence (though not named in the report), and several departments kept cropping up, too. Witnesses spoke of a ‘macho culture’ in which women were not welcome. Female members of staff would be told to make the tea, or asked if they needed to work or had a husband. Shockingly, there were allegations of racial abuse, also.The human cost of this is all too clear. ‘People who believed themselves to be strong, capable iniduals suddenly found that they were unable to eat or sleep properly, or they were shouting at their children or partners, or were prone to sudden bouts of crying or panic attacks,’ writes Dame Laura.One of the 200 people interviewed privately by Dame Laura spoke movingly of her feelings, and neatly sums up what is at stake. ‘We are proud to work in the House of Commons, but when we are abused those who lead us should support us, not abandon us to our fate and cover up the traces. And those who abuse us should be held accountable.‘Establishing a new complaints and grievance process won’t come close to solving the problems in this place. We need a seismic shift. But the institution is worth fighting for.’I take no pleasure in supporting the call for the Speaker to step down. He has made some useful changes which have helped hold the Executive to account, but he himself must be held to account and, as the report makes clear, without real change at the top there is doubt that anything will change down the line. The right of people going about their daily work to be treated with dignity, free of abuse at the hands of the powerful, be it sexual or otherwise, cannot be ‘trumped’, in the words of Margaret Beckett, by any political consideration — even one as momentous as Brexit.‘It may be that some iniduals will want to think very carefully about whether they are the right people to press the reset button and to do what is required to deliver that change in the best interests of the House,’ says Dame Laura.No name is mentioned, but you don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes to work out the identity of one of those she is talking about.Some years ago, I played a small part in the downfall of the previous Speaker, Michael Martin. This was during the MPs’ expenses row, when he sought to cover up the details. He was sensible enough to listen to voices of concern and was able to leave while still retaining some dignity. Speaker Bercow should do the same.But as long as the Remainers in Labour — including those women MPs who are normally obsessed with equality — turn a blind eye in the name of political expediency, then he will stay right where he is in the crucial months ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"Director Michael Moore meets Pope Francis outside Vatican","story":"Michael Moore was pictured on the steps of St Peter\u0027s shaking hands and exchanging words with the pontiff          The film director waited among some of the Church\u0027s most senior cardinals to be granted an audience with Pope Francis on WednesdayMoore was raised a Catholic, but is no longer a practicing member of the Church according to an interview he carried out with a magazine back in 2012.He has also previously stated that he disagrees with the Church on issues of abortion and same-sex marriage, but believes there is a God.   In a seemingly sarcastic tweet in October 2016 Moore posted: \u0027Pope Francis has asked the United States, North Korea, Iran and Saudi Arabia to take one year off from killing people via execution.\u0027 But prior to that, Moore had expressed confidence that Pope Francis would be a breath of fresh air for the Church after he was announced in 2013. \u0027Say Our Prayers Tonight That This Pope Is Going to Be a Different Pope\u0027 he said at the time. Moore is currently in Rome to promote his recently released documentary \u0027Fahrenheit 119.\u0027             Moore could be seen taking photos on his phone as the Pope arrived to give his weekly address          He was pictured next to the youngest child of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr., Bernice Albertine King (right) as they met Pope FrancisPope Francis defrocks two bishops caught in Chile\u0027s widening...Pope Francis says having an abortion is like \u0027hiring a...Pope Francis blames the DEVIL for Catholic Church\u0027s sexual...Share this articleThe film is a dissection of the  2016 Presidential election and the subsequent Trump presidency and has grossed $6 million since its release last month.Outspoken Trump-critic Moore has admitted that the film is unashamedly partisan and defended comparisons between the President and Hitler. \u0027People said to me you\u0027re comparing Trump to Hitler,\u0027 says the 64-year-old filmmaker, author, comedian and activist, in London for the documentary\u0027s UK premiere.\u0027I said, no, that is a scene where Hitler is speaking like Trump.

We met newsreader and Classic FM host John Suchet to find outComplete the sentence: ‘Music and food are the perfect match because ...’They exercise your senses. Eating should be a sensuous experience, and sometimes you have to rush your meal, which is sacrilege in a way. If you’re able to, take time to enjoy it.What music do you play when you’re entertaining? Baroque has a nice steady beat, and sits nicely in the background. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons is an obvious one, but people can hum along while eating.What three songs would you always put on a dinner party playlist?JS Bach’s Goldberg Variations for the starter Vivaldi’s Four Seasons by Rachel Podger as a main then Gavotte Pavlova for dessert, served with pavlova!You’re cooking Beautifully Simple cod and prawns with fennel and white wine on the Classic FM podcast (see recipe below) – is it a combo you enjoy?Absolutely, my wife and I love fish, and I adore the aniseed taste of fennel – it goes so well together. A winning combination.What do the ingredients make you think of?Cod takes me back to my university days in Dundee. We’d go to a hot dog stand and have fish and chips with mushy peas. Now the batter is a lot better than it used to be!What kind of cook are you?I cannot cook. I’m not proud of this. I’m really good at boiling eggs though – I have a 1970s electric egg-boiling machine that my mum gave me. Every weekend I’m in charge of eggs!What’s your favourite dish?I absolutely adore duck in any form. Either confit de canard or magret de canard. Served with apple for a bit of sharpness, mashed potatoes and anything green.Are you an adventurous eater?I have one rule when it comes to what I won’t eat – it mustn’t be moving. As a reporter, you eat when you can, so I’m the absolute opposite of a fussy eater.What’s your go-to easy meal?My wife will slap a steak in a frying pan, grill it on one side, then the other. I like it with a bit of pinkness, no embellishments. Maybe a little bit of onion and garlic, nothing fancy.What piece of music reminds you of a particularly amazing meal?The last big story I covered was the 1986 revolution in the Philippines. The day after the president was elected, I got an exclusive interview with her – it was the high point of my career. That evening, I took my crew out to dinner in Manila and there was a string quartet playing Mozart’s Little Night Music. Whenever I hear it, I think of that interview.What music always makes food taste better?Music you enjoy. Andrew Lloyd Webber said there’s only good music and bad music, and I agree.What would be your desert island meal?Artichoke as a starter, followed by duck – I could find that on a desert island! Then lemon sorbet.Which restaurant plays the greatest music?I don’t like restaurants to play music. If you’re eating out, you’re with somebody you like and want to chat.If your favourite song was a meal, what would that be?Frank Sinatra’s I’ve Got You Under My Skin is my favourite song. I’m a trombonist and it has an amazing solo. It’s lively, so I’d say something Chinese – a stir-fry with scallops and noodles!Listen to John as he cooks on the Classic FM podcast at campaign.classicfmclassical-kitchenIngredients20g Duchy Organic English salted butter1 small bulb of fennel, thinly sliced (save the fronds)1 trimmed leek, sliced thinly150ml dry white wine, such as Californian chardonnay½ x 200ml pot Waitrose half fat French crème fraîche260g pack Icelandic cod loin, cut into thick slices8 raw extra-large king prawns25g Cooks’ Ingredients flat leaf parsley, choppedMethod:Melt the butter in a frying pan or medium casserole and add the fennel and some seasoning.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces had several admirers last week. Peter Law-Jones wrote:Coming to the end of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a surreal journey through a febrile mind and New Orleans. The sense of a truly absurd world is both unsettling and very funny. An excellent read.And the Thepuffpastryhangman said:I’m enjoying A Confederacy of Dunces for a second time. An utter joy. The descriptions of Ignatius’s ‘hobby’ make me snork every time. Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But a new cross-party movement hopes to revive itEighty years ago, Britain gave me a lifeline. It was 1939 and the Nazis had invaded Czechoslovakia. I, like hundreds of other children, was bundled on to a train out of Prague with little more than some clothes and a packed lunch my mother had made to keep me from going hungry on the long trip to England. I didn’t understand why this was happening. Nor did I know, as I sat in my train carriage trundling through Europe, that I was not only on a journey to a new country – I was starting a whole new life.Britain offered me sanctuary and it became my home. Most importantly of all, though I didn’t understand that then, Britain gave me safety, which meant that I could make plans for my future and realise those plans.Now, when I look at the images of refugees drowning in the Mediterranean, I often think back to that little boy on a train crossing Europe. They too are fleeing death and destruction. They too want nothing more than safety. Like me, they are forced to look beyond their countries’ borders for help.However, 80 years after the UK helped me, Britain is now denying similar help to other refugee children. There are 3,400 unaccompanied refugee children in Greece. More arrive daily. So far the UK government has taken just 15.But I would be naive if I thought that it is only refugees who were suffering mistreatment. In different ways, British citizens too are victims of an insidious political narrative that blames and punishes the vulnerable, the disabled and the poor, victimises minorities and deliberately ides communities. The evidence is clear: queues at food banks, rising homelessness, bulging prisons and an increase in hate crimes. Refugees are the thin end of the wedge.Across Europe we are seeing a sinister development: the rise of the far right in countries such as Hungary, Italy and Germany, which wishes to exploit the issue of refugees for its own political ends. In this country, inequality is rising. We face a mental-health crisis. The environment is being destroyed. Trust in politicians is at an all-time low.For many years I have worked with inspiring iniduals to combat injustice. I have been proud of the achievements of the causes I support – from Safe Passage and Help Refugees to the Refugee Council and Liberty. But I have also realised that unless we change the values that underlie our politics, we cannot have a compassionate and just society.That is why this Saturday I will be speaking at the launch of Compassion in Politics, a new cross-party initiative that aims to put compassion, empathy, and cooperation at the heart of politics.Together we will overturn the oppressive narrative that says that all humans are just greedy and selfish and our political system and society must be built in that image. We will point to the founding of the NHS, the Kindertransport that gave me hope, and the many young volunteers who give up years of their lives for virtually no money helping in the refugee camps in France, Greece and elsewhere, as examples of British compassion. We will argue that a political system and political ideas that reflect and encourage our own innate ability to feel compassion would make for a happier, more equal, just and productive society. And we will propose that in future all new policies will need to be judged by the extent to which they are built on and promote compassionate values.The experiences of my childhood mean I can never claim to be from one place or another. But I think I have benefited greatly through my life by meeting others like me who feel they belong nowhere – or everywhere. Those powerful friendships are far more important to me than any arbitrary isions governments create between communities and nations.Ideas, values, and love do not stop at borders they are not the property of one class or race and they grow stronger, not weaker, in the face of hate. Compassion in Politics is about proving that to be the case and creating a platform from which a new political programme – one built on cooperation, compassion, and empathy – can emerge. I am excited about what this project can achieve.• Alf Dubs is a Labour party peer and former MP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49dea83d418c85bf260411c33dc59791e8016b79/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=476c73836e267409bb5b18ee09310ee2","title":"governments no longer trusted climate change citizens revolt","story":"It is hard to believe today, but the prevailing ethos among the educated elite was once public service. As the historian Tony Judt documented in Ill Fares the Land, the foremost ambition among graduates in the 1950s and 60s was, through government or the liberal professions, to serve their country. Their approach might have been patrician and often blinkered, but their intentions were mostly public and civic, not private and pecuniary.As for the economic elite, as the consequences of their own greed and self-interest emerge, they seek, like the Roman oligarchs fleeing the collapse of the western empire, only to secure their survival against the indignant mob. An essay by the visionary author Douglas Rushkoff this summer, documenting his discussion with some of the world’s richest people, reveals that their most pressing concern is to find a refuge from climate breakdown, and economic and societal collapse. Should they move to New Zealand or Alaska? How will they pay their security guards once money is worthless? Could they upload their minds on to supercomputers? Survival Condo, the company turning former missile silos in Kansas into fortified bunkers, has so far sold every completed unit.Trust, the Edelman Corporation observes, “is now the deciding factor in whether a society can function”. Unfortunately, our mistrust is fully justified. Those who have destroyed belief in governments exploit its collapse, railing against a liberal elite (by which they mean people still engaged in public service) while working for the real and illiberal elite. As the political economist William Davies points out, “sovereignty” is used as a code for rejecting the very notion of governing as “a complex, modern, fact-based set of activities that requires technical expertise and permanent officials”.Nowhere is the gulf between public and private interests more obvious than in governments’ response to the climate crisis. On Monday, UK energy minister Claire Perry announced that she had asked her advisers to produce a roadmap to a zero-carbon economy. On the same day, fracking commenced at Preston New Road in Lancashire, enabled by the permission Perry sneaked through parliament on the last day before the summer recess.The minister has justified fracking on the grounds that it helps the country affect a “transition to a lower-carbon economy”. But fracked gas has net emissions similar to, or worse than, those released by burning coal. As we are already emerging from the coal era in the UK without any help from fracking, this is in reality a transition away from renewables and back into fossil fuels. The government has promoted the transition by effectively banning onshore wind farms, while overriding local decisions to impose fracking by central diktat. Now, to prevent people from taking back control, it intends to grant blanket planning permission for frackers to operate.None of it makes sense, until you remember the intimate relationship between the fossil fuel industry, the City (where Perry made her fortune) and the Tory party, oiled by the political donations flowing from both sectors into the party’s coffers. These people are not serving the nation. They are serving each other.In Germany, the government that claimed to be undergoing a great green energy transition instead pours public money into the coal industry, and deploys an army of police to evict protesters from an ancient forest to clear it for a lignite mine. On behalf of both polluting power companies and the car industry, it has sabotaged the EU’s attempt to improve its carbon emissions target. Before she was re-elected, I argued that Angela Merkel was the world’s leading eco-vandal. She might also be the world’s most effective spin doctor: she can mislead, cheat and destroy, and people still call her Mutti. Other governments shamelessly flaunt their service to private interests, as they evade censure by owning their corruption. A US government report on fuel efficiency published in July concedes, unusually, that global temperatures are likely to rise by 4C this century. It then uses this forecast to argue that there is no point in producing cleaner cars, because the disaster will happen anyway. Elsewhere, all talk of climate breakdown within government is censored. Any agency seeking to avert it is captured and redirected.In Australia, the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, has turned coal burning into a sacred doctrine. I would not be surprised if the only lump of coal he has ever handled is the one he flourished in the Australian parliament. But he dirties his hands every day on behalf of the industry. These men with black hearts and clean fingernails wear their loyalties with pride.If Jair Bolsonaro takes office in Brazil, their annihilistic actions will seem mild by comparison. He claims climate breakdown is a fable invented by a “globalist conspiracy”, and seeks to withdraw from the Paris agreement, abolish the environment ministry, put the congressional beef caucus (representing the murderous and destructive ranching industry) in charge of agriculture, open the Amazon Basin for clearance and dismantle almost all environmental and indigenous protections.With the exception of Costa Rica, no government has the policies required to prevent more than 2C of global warming, let alone 1.5C. Most, like the UK, Germany, the US and Australia, push us towards the brink on behalf of their friends. So what do we do, when our own representatives have abandoned public service for private service?On 31 October, I will speak at the launch of Extinction Rebellion in Parliament Square. This is a movement devoted to disruptive, nonviolent disobedience in protest against ecological collapse. The three heroes jailed for trying to stop fracking last month, whose outrageous sentences have just been overturned, are likely to be the first of hundreds. The intention is to turn this national rising into an international one.This preparedness for sacrifice, a long history of political and religious revolt suggests, is essential to motivate and mobilise people to join an existential struggle. It is among such people that you find the public and civic sense now lacking in government. That we have to take such drastic action to defend the common realm shows how badly we have been abandoned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0952d37ca4377cc82e21976ff2f93cb18b17e24/0_190_2462_1478/master/2462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=566667ac2ce153f657186707b1c9443f","title":"mohammed bin salman brutality saudi jamal khashoggi","story":"In June, when the ban on Saudi women driving ended, it was portrayed around the world as part of a modernising, liberalising agenda by the new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Yet the authorities ordered female activists not to speak out in its favour. Their blunt message was that what was being offered was the gift of King Salman and his crown prince son, and not a result of the campaign by female activists. In fact, the government had arrested 11 of these activists a month beforehand. Though four were released, the remaining seven had led a petition demanding that the female ship system – which treats adult women as legal minors – be abolished. They remain in detention without charge, but could face up to 25 years in jail.In this way, what happened was nothing to do with reform but more like business as usual. In many ways the crown prince has already been more despotic than previous rulers, so the murky events in Istanbul surrounding the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate should not be quite as shocking as they may have first appeared.In the summer of 2017, 30 Saudi clerics, writers and intellectuals were jailed for expressing their opposition to the policies of the Royal Palace driven by Bin Salman. It was then that, sensing his arrest was imminent, Khashoggi fled to Washington. An eminent journalist and editor for 30 years, he had been banned from publishing articles or appearing on TV in December 2016 after his criticism of US president-elect Donald Trump.In his opinion articles in the Washington Post, he lambasted Riyadh’s diplomatic and commercial blockade of Qatar, its forcing of Lebanon’s prime minister Saad Hariri to resign (later revoked), and the crackdown on dissent and the media. Before the ascension to the throne by Crown Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz in January 2015, the Saudi monarchy allowed space, however reluctantly, for non-establishment Wahhabi clerics, and silenced dissenters by intimidation, co-option through cash handouts, and in the case of foreign-based opponents, periodic kidnaps. With the swift ascendancy of the headstrong Bin Salman, this changed.He has grabbed all centres of power, not only in the government – defence, the National Guard, interior ministry and its intelligence agencies – but also in the form of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil corporation, as well as in construction and broadcasting. Bin Salman achieved this under the guise of launching a seemingly popular anti-corruption campaign, sanctioned by his father, in November 2017 – detaining 326 businessmen and princes in the swanky Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. Royal court officials said the detainees had stolen assets from the government. It was thus that the kingdom’s topmost duo eliminated their rival powers, including descendants of former King Abdullah. His son, Prince Mutaib, was removed as commander of the powerful National Guard. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the richest Saudi, with a net worth of $17.4bn, was confined to the Ritz-Carlton for almost 12 weeks. Eventually, after reaching an undisclosed deal and telling a TV interviewer that “Everything’s fine”, he was released. His vast mansion was placed under armed guard. Like all other freed detainees, he had to wear ankle bracelets so that his movements could be traced.The huge construction corporation, Saudi Binladin Group, with 100,000 employees and an annual turnover of $30bnsed.In January, security services arrested 11 princes after their refusal to leave the historic Qasr al-Hokm palace in old Riyadh. They were held at al-Hair maximum-security prison. They had gathered there merely to frame an objection to a decree in which the government would stop paying the princes’ utility bills.The detained women’s rights activists have been smeared in the state-guided newspapers, which have accused their campaign of treason and implied it is funded by the much maligned Qatar.Thanks to their sympathisers, and international human rights organisations, the women’s rights activists remain in the public eye. In sharp contrast, the fate of the dissenting clerics, writers and intellectuals held without trial remains unknown. Equally unknown is the fate of the 56 Ritz-Carlton detainees who were brave enough to resist official coercion and threats, and were then transferred to traditional jails. These persecuted groups have become non-persons, the early victims of a totalitarian regime in the making under the 33-year-old Bin Salman.Yet history shows that the brutal suppression of dissent leads to a build-up of popular discontent to a boiling point, with disastrous consequences. King Salman is old enough to remember what happened to the shah of Iran. He should share his memory with his most favoured son.• Dilip Hiro is the author of Cold War in the Islamic World: Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Struggle for Supremacy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

The Manhattan district attorney’s office detailed the alleged misconduct in a letter to Weinstein’s lawyer that was made public. The new allegations against Det Nicholas DiGaudio involve an unidentified woman who says Weinstein raped her in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013. In the letter, assistant district attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said during the investigation, prosecutors asked the woman to hand in any mobile phones she might have used during the time when she interacted with Weinstein. The woman, she said, was willing to do so, but was worried the phones contained, “in addition to communications with the defendant, data of a personal nature that she regarded as private”. She asked DiGaudio what to do. He advised her to delete anything she didn’t want anyone else to see before handing over the phones, the prosecutors said. “We just won’t tell Joan,” DiGaudio allegedly said. Illuzzi-Orbon said the woman didn’t delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice. The phones were turned over “without any deletions”, Illuzzi-Orbon said. The lawyer hired by the woman contacted the district attorney’s office about DiGaudio’s conduct on 10 October. Weinstein’s lawyer Benjamin Brafman said the latest allegation against DiGaudio “even further undermines the integrity of this already deeply flawed indictment of Mr Weinstein”. DiGaudio was removed from the Weinstein case last week after evidence surfaced that he urged a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about whether a different accuser’s alleged sexual encounter with Weinstein was consensual. That revelation led prosecutors to drop a charge related to that allegation. There was no immediate response from DiGaudio’s union or the New York City police department."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a817aff5241fbf353c8887cc92627f8d415bb604/0_205_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35e9ba9b6cb1c699bf28fa82df41e7f0","title":"no goodbye at the end of phone calls readers on things only done in movies","story":"Following on from our examples of things people only do in the movies, we’ve put together a selection of your suggestionsThey don’t say goodbye at the end of phone calls in films or even wrap them up in any kind of way which I actually like.

That “cheeky” chain, Nando’s, has been described as “one of the most successful cults in Britain”, having carved itself an unlikely, but undeniable niche in our national identity. In perhaps the ultimate sign of its success, piri piri has now been added to the list of dubious attractions at my local Texan fried chicken shop, too. It seems we just can’t get enough spicy grilled poultry.Popularity, however, breeds contempt – and, even leaving aside questions of animal welfare, not all this piri piri has the vim and vinegar of the salty, sizzling stuff shoved through the hatch of your average Lisbon kiosk or churrascaria. Fortunately, however, if you can grill chicken, you can make much better piri piri chicken at home.The name piri piri comes from the variety of chilli used, a cultivar of Capsicum frutescens, which also includes tabasco chillies, probably taken by the Portuguese from their colonies in South America to those in Africa and, from there, to Europe. In Swahili, pili pili apparently means pepper-pepper – prompting the witticism “the chilli so hot they named it twice” – and it lives up to that reputation. The fruit registers 50,000-175,000 Scoville units (a measurement based on the amount of sugared water necessary to neutralise its fire), qualifying it for the “very hot” category in Kay Plunkett-Hogge’s book Heat, one below pure capsaicin (16m units, and “explosive!”).However, piri piri, while hot, aren’t particularly distinctively flavoured if the dried fruit I buy are anything to go by, so Plunkett-Hogge’s recommendation to substitute the similarly pungent (50,000-100,000 Scoville), easily available Thai bird’s eye chillies seems a good one. That said, given the heat is the important thing, so long as you stick with ripe red chillies, you can use just about any piquant variety you like.Add them to taste, as Seal suggests, bearing in mind that “the fieriness of the paste will be weakened by cooking, so go for slightly more heat than you think you like”.Seal’s recipe also includes red bell peppers, presumably as much for their colour as flavour, giving her piri piri a pleasing sweetness that goes down well with testers as a sauce, yet lacks the fire of some of the other versions. Again, that’s not necessarily a problem: according to Taste of Lisboa food tours: “We don’t even like spicy food that much. Yes, there is the possibility to order roasted chicken with spicy sauce, but most of the people don’t order the sauce and prefer to accompany chicken with fries.” In the UK, of course, we like both.Even more popular than the red pepper, however, is the brick-red paprika used by Tessa Kiros in her book Piri Piri Starfish, and by Stein and Phipps, whose choice of sweet and smoky is particularly useful if climatic conditions preclude barbecuing the meat. Those deploying a milder variety of fresh chilli might prefer to go for the hot sort instead: it’s up to you.This is a spicy, rather than a herby dish. My testers don’t think the oregano used by Henry, Phipps, Stein and Kiros adds that much once the heat is ramped up, and the same goes for Kiros’s bay leaf. Both would get lost in my fiery sauce, but may prove more welcome in milder versions.Similarly, the bold flavour of garlic is preferred to Phipps’s milder sauteed onion, but then, her sauce – based on the African Volcano range by South African chef Grant Hawthorne – is quite a different beast from the rest: a smoky, tomatoey, almost chutney-like affair that ends with a real kick. Hawthorne tells me that his recipe is based on one from Beira in Mozambique, and helpfully adds that west African versions use cumin and ginger, while ex-Portuguese colonies often include vinho verde as well as citrus for a sharper flavour. The testers absolutely love it as an accompaniment, but we all find its complex flavours get a bit lost in the cooking process, while simpler, sour and spicy marinades such as Mendes’s still shine as brightly as ever.Sharpness is one of the key qualities in most piri piri sauces, usually added in the form of lemon juice or wine vinegar – I prefer the cleaner flavour of the former, but either will do, and you may also like to add a little balancing sweetness, in the guise of sugar, as Henry, Phipps and Stein do, or port, as Kiros does. The latter feels pleasingly apt to me, but only if you have a bottle open: it doesn’t make enough difference to merit a special purchase – unless you’re looking for an excuse, of course.Mendes adds a whole lemon to his piri piri paste, which gives it a very distinctive, though not unpleasant, bitter zestiness that completely overpowers the chilli. Interesting, but not as universally popular as the crisps he suggests as an accompaniment.In Portugal, whole spatchcocked chickens are popular, but they tend to be smaller than can easily be found in the UK (Kiros calls for 800g birds the closest I can find is 1.2kg). As meatier breasts tend to dry out over a high heat, I’m going to go with Seal’s whole legs instead – although Stein’s large thighs are as delicious as you might have imagined in your most secret dreams, and the wings, which I don’t try, would be perfect for a party situation.Seal and Phipps marinate their chicken overnight in piri piri, Mendes leaves it for two hours, Kiros adds the sauce to the chicken for the last few minutes of cooking, and Stein doesn’t slosh it on until the meat is off the heat entirely. Stein’s method has the benefit of keeping the skin super-crisp, but it lacks the charred chilli flavour of the others. Kiros’s method feels like the best compromise – long enough for a spot of charring, short enough to keep the flavours fresh.Like Stein, she marinates the meat in lemon juice, garlic and salt first, as would be traditional in a Portuguese churrascaria, I believe. This gives it an addictive flavour without any risk of burning on the grill, a few flecks of garlic aside. However, Harold McGee has written that there’s no point in leaving it in this acidic bath for more than two hours, telling the LA Times that: “Any longer than that, and the meat will have a kind of mealy stuff on the surface. The structured meat tissue becomes tiny protein particles – fine for a paté, but not what you want in a steak” – or, indeed, grilled chicken.Mendes and Kiros both use large amounts of butter in their sauce, giving the finished dish a richness, but also tempering the heat. This prompts me to use olive oil instead, though you may prefer to go down their route. Some recipes also include whisky or brandy for preservation purposes, but unless you’re planning on keeping the sauce for a while, it doesn’t add much to the flavour.The barbecue is ideal for this purpose, but you can also get excellent results in the oven, as Stein recommends. I prefer to finish them off in a hot griddle pan rather than under the grill, which I find fiddly and more work to clean up.Serve with chips and lemon wedges if you want to go Portuguese, though it’s also very nice indeed with rice to soak up the extra sauce. Or, in Mendes’s style, freshly fried potato crisps – I have it on reliable authority that a bag from the supermarket also does the trick.4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick), skin on, bone inFor the marinadeJuice of ½ lemon4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp flaky saltFor the piri piri sauce2-4 red African or Thai bird’s eye chillies, to taste2 plump garlic cloves, peeledJuice of 1 lemon1½ tsp flaky salt2 tsp sweet smoked paprika50ml olive oil1 tbsp port or 1 tsp brown sugar (optional)Whisk together the lemon juice and garlic for the marinade. Put the chicken in a roasting tin just big enough to hold it, and pour the garlicky juice all over it, turning to ensure it’s well coated. Sprinkle with the salt, cover and leave at room temperature (unless it’s a very hot day) for an hour.Meanwhile, roughly chop two chillies (gloves are advisable) and the garlic, add the lemon juice and salt, and whizz to a puree (or mash well in a mortar). Whisk in the paprika and oil. Taste, adding more chilli if you think it needs it, and the port or sugar if you’d prefer it a bit sweeter.Prepare the barbecue, if using. Once it’s at cooking temperature, grill the chicken for 35 minutes with the lid on, then check. If it’s almost done, then brush with piri piri and cook, lid off, for about another 10 minutes, until cooked through.Alternatively, heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6 and roast the chicken for about 35 minutes, until cooked through, basting with its juices occasionally. Heat a griddle pan to medium hot, brush the chicken with piri piri, and grill for a few minutes on each side, until just starting to char.Either way, serve hot with the extra sauce on the side.• Piri piri chicken: do you prefer the Portuguese version or the African originals – and does Nando’s make a decent fist of it? If not, where else would you recommend? And piri piri prawns are delicious – but what else is delicious with this fiery sauce?

For Glasgow City, by contrast, this was a difficult night, reality hitting hard. Aspiration is one thing, attainment another a club built in part upon a Barcelona model, studied at close quarters here by City’s former manager Eddie Wolecki Black, were defeated 5-0 at the Mini Estadi, undone piece by piece.“We can hurt them,” Scott Booth had said. Instead it was Glasgow who hurt, the tie surely over already – yet recriminations may be relatively few so significant, so unavoidable was the difference between these sides.The game’s first shot actually came for Glasgow, Abbi Grant slicing past the near post after two minutes but by half-time there had been only two more – and one of those, blocked, did not even make it into the area. Two more in a single second-half minute, with the score already at 4-0, were the sum of their attempts and neither drew a save from Sandra Paños. Barcelona, by contrast, had 27 of them. That reflected the fact that victory was always likely, if not necessarily quite like this.A first-leg defeat in Kazakhstan in the previous round had come as a warning but Barcelona knew they were favourites – and Glasgow knew it too. These teams are at markedly different stages of their respective seasons Glasgow had been defeated by Hibernian in the cup and face a battle against the same team this weekend to retain a domestic title that has been theirs alone for a decade, the culmination of a long season the Catalans have only just begun and had scored 21 times in the last four games, nine in their last game alone. Paños was a spectator as they added five more here.At the other end Lee Alexander twice had to be alert in the first half. She would later be to blame for a goal in the second half but that was the fourth, the game already long gone. When the opener had come, she could do little more than watch it float over her head and for much of the remaining 80 minutes she saw Barcelona from worryingly close range, her defence virtually treading on her toes, retreating further with every minute, forced ever deeper.The scoring began when Mariona Caldentey escaped down the right. Her cross bent beyond the leap of Andressa Alves but found its way through to Kheira Hamraoui, arriving from midfield. She cut back, shifted her weight and chipped the ball up and over Alexander, a touch of curve and dip bringing it down well below the bar. A Champions League winner with Lyon, this was her first goal for a Barcelona side who seek to emulate that achievement. Only 11 minutes had gone but it was already their third attempt and it quickly felt like this game had escaped Glasgow.Barcelona took control, the ball theirs, the territory and opportunities too. Patri Guijarro hit the bar not long after and in the next move a pattern became evident that was soon unavoidable: as Barcelona pressed Glasgow had 10 players inside their own area, only Kirsty Howat not joining them and occupying a lonely island near the halfway line.And for all the players in there Barcelona still escaped them. The tall No 10 Alves attacked on the left again, rolled the ball under her studs and pulled it across the area. Arriving by the penalty spot Caldentey dummied it and Aitana Bonmatí slotted home the second unattended. Three minutes later they had a third. A perfectly weighted pass from Vicky Losada played in Caldentey and although Alexander moved swiftly to block the followup shot it bounced to Guijarro to score.The second half brought much of the same. Leila Ouahabi struck wide Caldentey headed past the post then Alves could not control Caldentey’s ball inside the six-yard box. A series of corners yielded little but still they came, still the ball circulated at Catalan feet.When it reached Alexander’s hands on 68 minutes it inexplicably slipped through, Alves’s shot from the edge of the area escaping her grasp and ending up in the net.Next María León’s shot skidded through and into the net. Natasa Andonova then thumped one off the bar, but there were no more. Five was enough fun for Barcelona for one night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90790bb00b0733a3dc555dacd74654eec2927691/665_628_5304_3183/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af68c0edc553f67c900a74f9a8d1f6a9","title":"crewe suspend academy coach fa inquiry carl everall safeguarding issue","story":"• Head of foundation Carl Everall’s behaviour investigated• Crewe back in spotlight after Gradi and Bennell casesCrewe Alexandra have suspended their head of foundation because of a safeguarding issue that has led to the club notifying the Football Association.Carl Everall, who has been coaching in the club’s academy since 2013, is also understood to have been suspended from all football-related activities by the FA while the governing body conducts inquiries into allegations relating to his behaviour. “This is a safeguarding and police matter so therefore the FA is not in a position to comment,” an FA spokesman said.Everall was previously an academy coach at Port Vale and left his position as joint manager at Whitchurch Alport, of the North West Counties League, to start working full-time for Crewe 14 months ago. He is well known within Crewe for his football work in the community and the charity game, the Everall Derby, he organises with his twin, Simon, a former Crewe trainee. His coaching qualifications include the FA advanced youth award and he is described as a popular figure at the club.However, the news of another possible investigation involving Crewe will be another blow to the club’s troubled reputation at a time when Dario Gradi, their director of football, has not returned to work since being suspended by the FA in December 2016.Crewe had initially hoped to keep the investigation relating to Everall as an in-house matter but when the  contacted the club on Wednesday the chairman, John Bowler, instigated high-level talks with his colleagues and a statement was released. “You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for us to comment in detail at this time,” it said. “I can, however, confirm that all relevant and appropriate procedures have been followed.”Gradi, who has been at Crewe since 1983, including 24 years and more than 1,200 games as manager, was ordered to stay away from football while the relevant authorities investigated his specific role in what the FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport.Gradi, who has an MBE for his services to football, employed Barry Bennell, the youth-team coach who was sent to prison for 30 years in February for raping and molesting boys in the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City. Bennell, described as an “industrial-scale child molester”, is waiting to hear whether the Crown Prosecution Service is to press more charges relating to some of the other complainants. As of January, at least 97 people – though possibly more now – had reported Bennell to the police on the back of the interview Andy Woodward gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.What was never made clear was whether Gradi’s suspension related to anything that had happened at Crewe, or if it went back to claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender in the 1970s.Clive Sheldon, the QC who is undertaking the FA-commissioned independent inquiry into football’s sexual-abuse scandal, announced last month that it was being delayed indefinitely, largely because of the possibility that Bennell could face another criminal trial. Manchester City and Chelsea have been holding their own inquiries but Crewe’s decision that one was not necessary at Gresty Road, having initially promised a full investigation, has attracted widespread condemnation from Bennell’s victims and dismayed the relevant authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5179c5db75738919586821269903acb846d74523/0_298_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b17bc01ae5605cdcd6105935abbce511","title":"the coming of the mine separated us a community split in south africa","story":"Poverty, conservation and industry are at loggerheads in the eastern town of SomkheleDrive for an hour into the hills that lie behind South Africa’s wild eastern coast, and you will find a game park full of rhino and big cats, a sprawling town spread over dozens of summits and dry valleys, and a vast opencast coal mine.If all the advantages of the rainbow nation – stunning landscape and wildlife, massive mineral resources and a youthful population – are represented here, then so too are all its problems.Somkhele is home to tens of thousands of people living in rudimentary houses on parched patches of land, many of whom would be entirely destitute without monthly welfare payments of less than £20.Within a 15-minute drive, there is Hluhluwe–Imfolozi, the oldest nature reserve in Africa, where hundreds of rhinos, antelope and big cats graze under the wondering gaze of tourists. In between lie the rubble and workings of the opencast mine.The tensions between the three are now reaching a critical point. The mining company wants to dig out more coal, and has been granted rights for a vast new swath of land. Activists in Somkhele have gone to court to shut the mine, or at least stop any expansion, which mining officials say would have the same result. A judgment is due within weeks and will set a precedent that could have far-reaching consequences.“If the judge finds against us, he is saying mining companies in South Africa don’t have to comply with the law, and that is terrifying. If he finds for us, he says the law in this country is to be respected by everybody,” said Kirsten Youens, a lawyer acting for community groups in Somkhele.Jan du Preez, CEO of Petmin, the company which owns the Somkhele mine, said its operations were fully compliant with all legal requirements, and accused critics of being activists who hate mining.“It would be wonderful if the world could obtain its raw materials with zero harm, but that is in utopia,” Du Preez told the .“While the world needs environmental activists to protect against unscrupulous people, these activists also need to … actually consider the facts. Unfortunately some are idealists who would rather have a devastated economy and no jobs than a responsibly run mine. ”Across South Africa, and across the continent, there are similar confrontations as officials come under pressure to ensure economic growth – even at the cost of the environment.Thulziwe Jane Dladla, who lives in a traditional cluster of small houses and huts overlooking the Somkhele mine, listed her grievances: dust, noise and ground-shaking blasting, heavy truck traffic, inadequate compensation for households relocated and a lack of communication since mining began a little over a decade ago.“Life here is too bad,” she said.Officials at the mine, which produces rare and valuable anthracite coal used in the metal industry, say none of these complaints is justified and point out benefits to the community including more than a thousand jobs, a maternity ward for the local clinic, roads, water pipes, a school, a creche and training programmes.Du Preez said fair compensation was paid to displaced families, with the costs of moving graves of ancestors also covered by the company.The community’s traditional leaders, elected municipal officials and the mining union’s local branches almost unanimously back the mine. So too, it appears, does the government. Last month, Gwede Mantashe, minister for mineral resources, travelled to Somkhele and the site of another controversial mine, Xolobeni, where an Australian company has been trying to mine titanium, to rally support.The African National Congress, in power since South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, believe such developments will give a much-needed boost to the country’s flagging economy.But Mantashe’s trip was not a success. In Somkhele, he angered some locals by leaving them waiting for several hours before a brief meeting. In Xolobeni, his visit ended in disorder, with teargas fired by police to disperse demonstrators and a well-known environmental lawyer arrested.“The minister was disrespectful,” said Bongani Pearce, one of the Somkhele activists. “The government isn’t on our side.”Dladla, 56, admitted the community was split, with some welcoming the opportunities the mine has brought in an area where jobs are rare, especially for young people. It is these isions that pain her most.“We were a community gathering together. But the coming of the mine separated us,” she said.Activists claim that Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president since February, is biased. The liberation struggle leader turned multimillionaire businessman made a fortune in mining before returning to politics.“They are all on the side of the mines. They don’t care about small people like us,” said Dladla.ANC officials dismiss the charge as ridiculous. They argue that South Africa is still desperately poor and cannot afford to ignore the earning potential of its resources. If mining has shrunk as a proportion of GDP, the industry has long been central to the party’s plans to empower and enrich the country’s majority communities.Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, said the approach was short-term.“Mining shouldn’t be seen as the solution to all problems. The government needs to be more creative in its thinking. We don’t have to destroy precious natural resources for ever,” she added.But the ANC is under pressure. Elections are due next year, and calls for rapid and radical economic transformation from populists like Julius Malema and his Economic Freedom Fighters party resonate with the millions who feel that the prosperity and equality promised when the racist apartheid regime crumbled are unfulfilled.“I don’t like the EFF’s strategy and all the confrontation, but I hear what they are saying and it makes sense,” said Dladla’s 25-year-old son, who has moved to the city of Durban, 140 miles (225km) away, to find work.With massive debts and limited revenue opportunities, ruling party officials are also desperate for foreign investment.One potential source is China, which recently promised investment of more than $1.1bn (£830m) in industrial infrastructure and plants, including a big coal mine in the north-east and a 4600MW coal-fired power station.Experts say renewable energy sources now offer a cheaper way to supply South Africa’s power needs, and would avoid extensive environmental damage.Some Somkhele inhabitants fear the coming judgement may exacerbate existing isions.“If we lose, the whole community will be torn apart. There will not be peace. There will be disorder,” said Duduzile Mkhwanazi, 36, a local farmer and mother of three.“But it is important. It is a start for us, a beginning. I don’t want my kids to grow up without jobs or schooling, but I don’t want them to grow up next to a mine either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1a2fed4d0ce6a6c4e464d13501fb58aeb02363/0_318_5117_3072/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8224ae160dd69d4b34a5ffd6d6a2a18","title":"julian assange ecaudor russia moscow embassy documents","story":"Government tried to name Assange as a political counselor to the Moscow embassy but British authorities vetoed his statusNewly released Ecuadorian government documents have laid bare an unorthodox attempt to extricate the WikiLeaks founder from his embassy hideaway in London by naming him as a political counselor to the country’s embassy in Moscow.But the 47-year-old Australian’s new career in international affairs was nipped in the bud when British authorities vetoed his diplomatic status, in effect blocking him from taking up the post in Russia.The files were made public late Tuesday by the Ecuadorian opposition lawmaker Paola Vintimilla, who opposes her government’s decision to grant Assange nationality. They largely corroborate a recent  report that Ecuador attempted the elaborate maneuver to get Assange to Moscow just before Christmas last year.Russian diplomats called the ’s story “fake news”, but the government files show Assange briefly was made “political counselor” to the Ecuadorian embassy in Moscow and eligible for a monthly salary pegged at $2,000.Ecuador also applied for a diplomatic ID card, the documents show, but the plan appears to have fallen apart with the British veto.A letter dated 21 December 2017 from Britain’s Foreign Office said UK officials “do not consider Mr Julian Assange to be an acceptable member of the mission”.An eight-page memo to Vintimilla summing up the episode noted that Assange’s position as counselor was scrapped a few days later.WikiLeaks did not return messages. The British Foreign Office and the Russian embassy in London declined to comment.Assange’s relationship with Russian authorities has been the subject of intense scrutiny following the 2016 US election, when Russian spies are alleged to have handed WikiLeaks leaked emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in a bid to help elect her rival, Donald Trump.Assange has denied receiving the files from the Russian government or backing the Trump campaign, despite a growing body of evidence suggesting he received material directly from Russia’s military intelligence agency and coordinated media strategy with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.Last month, the Associated Press published internal WikiLeaks files showing Assange tried to move to Russia as early as 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f21dd144059c85cc6d8bdc281be8d9aa1694aed/0_0_4807_2885/master/4807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8ecb0288569cb6a01f589a6e4abcb02","title":"murdoch children may get up to 2bn each in 21st century fox sale","story":"Rupert Murdoch’s six children could each receive as much as $2bn (£1.5bn) from the sale of his 21st Century Fox global entertainment empire to Disney.The beneficiaries of the trust, in which Murdoch has no financial interest, are his children Prudence, James, Lachlan and Elisabeth. Grace and Chloe, his daughters with his former wife Wendi Deng Murdoch, whom he orced five years ago, are also beneficiaries but have no voting interest in it.The $12bn figure, first reported by the Financial Times, is the maximum theoretical windfall Murdoch’s children could receive.There are, however, likely to be multibillion pound tax implications associated with the deal. Disney’s offer to Fox shareholders was made as a split of cash and shares and the former is taxable.Tax experts believe Murdoch would end up having to accept a “roughly”5050 mix between cash and Disney shares for the family trust’s holding. This would mean a bill of up to $2bn and more like a $10bn windfall for the trust and its beneficiaries.The Disney deal includes Fox’s interest in Sky, which Disney agreed to sell to Comcast after it won a £30bn auction for the pan-European pay-TV company last month.It does not, however, include the Murdoch family’s stake in News Corp, the owner of newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Wall Street Journal, or its holding in New Fox, the new parent company for assets not included in the Disney deal such as the Fox News channel and Fox TV network, which is worth billions of dollars. The spin-off also involves multibillion dollar tax implications.Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, are to continue to work side by side following the Fox sell-off, with Lachlan chairman and chief executive of New Fox and Murdoch co-chairman.The youngest son, James, currently 21st Century Fox’s chief executive, had been tipped for a potential role at Disney following completion of the deal but is instead striking out on his own.He has also been tipped to take over as chairman of Tesla, where he is an independent director, when Elon Musk steps down next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877e5d41a3b02f2d48cea7f44cdc24ac6ce7707e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62a1f6def8861a9d55a6944d00765f07","title":"inside the 26 october edition of the guardian weekly","story":"The mystery, outrage and intrigue surrounding what happened when Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul threatens to cause a fissure in the region and beyond.

May, who joined the Hollis tribute, replied: “The answer is no.”Corbyn said Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey had both refused to back Chequers. Maybe she could share a pizza with them and sort it out.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Corbyn’s next question referred to reports that Philip Hammond believes the UK may still have to pay most of a £39bn Brexit “orce bill” if there is no deal. May said the UK honoured its obligations. But nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.Corbyn asked May to confirm that the joint report she signed with the EU committed the UK to an Irish backstop without a time limit.May said the UK had said the backstop was to bridge the gap between the end of the implementation period and the future relationship coming into force. Corbyn said May signed an agreement with no time limit attached. Did she still stand by that?He said the car industry was clear it needed a new customs union to ensure continued investment in manufacturing. Jobs were at risk. Why wouldn’t May back a customs union to back jobs?May said the frictionless trade carmakers wanted was at the heart of her plan. Her plan would deliver on the referendum decision. Labour would not do that. It wanted a second referendum.Corbyn said Jaguar Land Rover was holding off investment until it knew what would happen. He said the public accounts committee said last week the Department of Health could not guarantee the supply of medicines after Brexit.May said Corbyn was talking about a no-deal scenario. The Department of Health was preparing for this.Corbyn said, according to the BMA the UK was woefully underprepared for this. The Tories had spent two years arguing with themselves over it. They were still bickering. They were too weak and too ided to protect jobs or the economy. So May had a choice. She could continue to put the Tory party first. Or she could put the interests of the country first.May said Corbyn had said nothing about the unemployment figures out this week. She listed government achievements: scrapping the cap on council spending on homes, freezing fuel duty, low unemployment, wages rising. Labour could play politics the Conservatives delivered for the people.It was a creditable performance from Corbyn but, with one exception, his questions did not really put May under much pressure, and it is hard to see either of them deserving credit for a resounding victory.Corbyn focused all his questions on Brexit, but he asked about six, quite separate topics and, although all his questions were pertinent (and shorter than usual, it sounded to me, which was welcome), May brushed them aside fairly easily.If you can’t get past the shield with the first question, you need a well-directed follow-up, but Corbyn has never been good at these and so this was an exchange marked by lost opportunities.May claimed Chequers was still policy. So can she promise MPs that she will only sign a deal that preserves all its elements? Or is she even willing to say the word out loud?And May says nothing is agreed on the Brexit bill until everything is agreed. So can she assure Tory Brexiters that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will pay nothing? (She can’t, because the UK would pay up, but she is loth to say so with Jacob Rees-Mogg in the room.)Corbyn’s best moment came when he asked May why she signed up to the Irish backstop in the December joint report agreed between the EU and the UK without insisting on a time limit. This is an excellent question because the only honest answer (“we were up against a deadline and we didn’t think it through”) won’t wash, and May sounded a little panicky as she waffled her way through her rather feeble answer. Six questions on this would have had her floundering badly. But Corbyn never pressed the point, and so May got off more lightly than she deserved.When Corbyn refers to Mordaunt and McVey’s doubts about Chequers, he gets in a dig about Brexiter MPs meeting for a pizza to discuss May’s plan:Maybe she could share a pizza with them and see if they can sort it out.There will be no second referendum.

The Mail says delaying leaving the bloc until the end of 2021 means it won’t happen until “five and a half years after the vote to leave”.Also furious is the Sun, which goes with the headline “Brextra time!”, saying “UK could be under control of EU for one more year”.

The campaign is backed by MPs from across the House of Commons.Writing in the  to mark the launch, Lord Dubs said he was concerned that politics based on the values of kindness and fellow feeling was being edged out by less generous forces, exemplified by the rise of the far right in places such as Hungary and Italy.Dubs wrote that refugees crossing the Mediterranean did not have the same luck as he did in 1939, when he was given sanctuary in the UK. “But I would be naive if I thought that it is only refugees who were suffering mistreatment,” he wrote.“In different ways, British citizens too are victims of an insidious political narrative that blames and punishes the vulnerable, the disabled and the poor, victimises minorities and deliberately ides communities.”The campaign will seek to challenge “the oppressive narrative that says that all humans are just greedy and selfish and our political system and society must be built in that image”, Dubs wrote, pointing to policies such as the NHS.“The experiences of my childhood mean I can never claim to be from one place or another. But I think I have benefited greatly through my life by meeting others like me who feel they belong nowhere – or everywhere,” he said.“Those powerful friendships are far more important to me than any arbitrary isions governments create between communities and nations.”People who have signed up to the campaign include the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, Caroline Lucas of the Greens, and the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, Jo Swinson.Swinson said the country needed a change from “the toxic political debate that we see so often”.She added: “This movement could not have come at a better time.

But now they are glorying in the limelight – and hard to destroyFascism is interesting in its “creep” stage, where you have a hint of what you’re looking at, but you’re not quite sure, and you keep turning it over for historical marks, like the Antiques Roadshow of the Coming Apocalypse. But not in its “march” stage, when antisemitism and Islamophobia are in the open, misogyny is basking under the studio lights, and white nationalism takes its democratically mandated place in ancient parliaments. Intellectually speaking, that’s very boring the arguments are tedious, even if emotionally it’s as epic and engrossing as watching your house burn down.Don’t beat yourself up, this is timeless: Marie Curie would not win a debate with Steve Bannon about whether she should carry on doing science or go back to the kitchen Sigmund Freud would not win an argument against Nigel Farage over whether the psychoanalyst was exerting undue influence because HE WAS A JEW. Authoritarians delight in the weakness of their case if they can be that wrong, and still prevail, they get to prove how strong they are and besmirch the principles of truth and respect at the same time, so it’s win-win.What we used to do really well was rules. Fascists are like vampires – the important thing is not to invite them into your house, or on to your radio talkshow. Even if they have brought apple martinis or a really novel and interesting way of making a racist point, even if they’re wearing skinny jeans and have bleached their hair and it’s a real thrill to hear a person dressed like that opine that women should attire themselves more modestly, still don’t invite them into your house. First, it is not enjoyable to have them in your house, and second, if it gets to hand-to-hand combat with a vampire, they’re much better at it than you.In the sub-category of anti-vampire measures, the garlic-and-crucifix market, there are artefacts that decent people carry: a taboo against certain words, not because they are overtly racist or demeaning, but precisely because they are deliberately opaque and plausibly deniable. So a thoughtful person doesn’t say “swarm” or “flood” or “cheat” or “bogus” when talking about large groups of human beings, and avoid them because they are dehumanising. You can’t flirt with a little, light dehumanisation enough to keep the centre undisturbed and the alt-right hopeful. It’s either there or it isn’t more like garlic, in this respect, than a crucifix.It’s too late to get the vampires out of the house, though never stop trying to vote them out. A blast of daylight would probably do it: economies recovering from stagnation, bonds of civility and internationalism repairing themselves in the warmth of prosperity. It doesn’t seem likely, but no nights last for ever. In the meantime, we’re in late-season Buffy territory: everyone losing confidence, regular blasts of cold reality corroding the spirit, the group fragmenting, the enemy getting stronger, not because it’s better, but because to be unquenchably bloodthirsty and to have no soul is quite the combination, when you want to make stuff happen.So, it’s a bit too late to point this out, but might help for next time: we shouldn’t have let the fascists into the house not on to Newsnight to fight for white power, not into the tabloids to preach gunning down refugees, not on to chatshows and reality TV. It wasn’t mischievous and fun, it was stupid.I have about a thousand fights a week on Twitter, but the only time I’ve ever had a fight, with a stranger, in real life, over my actual opinions, was in 2014. It was about pubs – in a pub. MPs had just voted to untie pubs from pubcos, having noticed that large pub chains were locking landlords into punitively high beer prices, for “reduced” rents that weren’t that low, and the landlords then worked themselves to death for often less than the minimum wage (of course, they weren’t technically employed, so it was nobody’s fault). Scores of pubs were closing weekly. It was a classic story of our social fabric picked apart by cannibalistic capitalism, I wrote. “That was the most ill-informed, ill-written, ill-thought-through piece of journalism I have ever read in a British newspaper,” said the guy, all finger-jabbing and thick pinstripe. I assumed he worked for a pubco and moved away.But the argument over the great British pub has never subsided: they are still in decline, and their demise is still a classic carrier issue. Everyone can find an explanation, depending on what they think is wrong with the world. I still think it’s a story about late-capitalism. People who like to blame millennials for everything can, legitimately, say that it’s because the younger generation doesn’t drink enough (snowflakes, you know). Yesterday, one of my regular Twitter foes blamed immigrants: they come over here, they don’t have a drinking culture, the next thing you know, you’re knee-deep in coffee and the Dog and Duck has shut down.Unlike a regular carrier issue, however, there is scope for some personal agency here: if you really want to show your commitment to pub culture, all you have to do is visit more pubs, more often, and stay longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca9d7cc04cec936fe16016e3bf1b921dd1db2c5/0_0_5998_3600/master/5998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1100c34108fc2938d31e02300d35ac1","title":"chinese city plans to launch artificial moon to replace streetlights","story":"‘Dusk-like glow’ of proposed satellite could light an area with a diameter of 10-80km, People’s Daily reportsIn Chengdu, there is reportedly an ambitious plan afoot for replacing the city’s streetlights: boosting the glow of the real moon with that of a more powerful fake one.The south-western Chinese city plans to launch an illumination satellite in 2020. According to an account in the People’s Daily, the artificial moon is “designed to complement the moon at night”, though it would be eight times as bright.The “dusk-like glow” of the satellite would be able to light an area with a diameter of 10-80km, while the precise illumination range could be controlled within tens of metres – enabling it to replace streetlights.The vision was shared by Wu Chunfeng, the chairman of the private space contractor Chengdu Aerospace Science and Technology Microelectronics System Research Institute Co (Casc), at a national mass innovation and entrepreneurship event held in Chengdu last week.Wu reportedly said testing had begun on the satellite years ago and the technology had now evolved enough to allow for launch in 2020. It is not clear whether the plan has the backing of the city of Chengdu or the Chinese government, though Casc is the main contractor for the Chinese space programme.The People’s Daily report credited the idea to “a French artist, who imagined hanging a necklace made of mirrors above the Earth which could reflect sunshine through the streets of Paris all year round”.The likelihood of Chengdu’s fake moon rising remains to be seen. But there are precedents for this moonage daydream rooted in science, though the technology and ambitions differ.In 2013 three large computer-controlled mirrors were installed above the Norwegian town of Rjukan to track the movement of the sun and reflect its rays down on the town square. “Rjukan – or at least, a small but vital part of Rjukan – is no longer stuck where the sun don’t shine,” reported the  at the time.Longer ago, in the 1990s, a team of Russian astronomers and engineers succeeded in launching a satellite into space to deflect sunlight back to Earth, briefly illuminating the night-time hemisphere.The Znamya experiment was to “test the feasibility of illuminating points on Earth with light equivalent to that of several full moons”, the New York Times said. “Several” proved an overstatement, but the design was shown to be sound.A more ambitious attempt, Znamya 2.5, was made in 1999, prompting preemptive concerns about light pollution disrupting nocturnal animals and astronomical observation. A spokesman for the technology ministry in Bonn was less concerned, telling the , “It’s a bit early for April Fool jokes but this sounds like one”.But Znamya 2.5 misfired on launch and its creators failed to raise funding for another attempt.The People’s Daily was quick to reassure those concerned about the fake moon’s impact on night-time wildlife.It cited Kang Weimin, director of the Institute of Optics, School of Aerospace, Harbin Institute of Technology, who “explained that the light of the satellite is similar to a dusk-like glow, so it should not affect animals’ routines”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2842f620c6982ca918b8919203df706caf86ef03/530_219_4158_2495/master/4158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e658f36c375cceac3632415003b308c","title":"charities urged to boost minority volunteering to tackle loneliness","story":"Voluntary sector failing to attract people from poorer and minority ethnic backgroundsThe crisis of loneliness identified this week by Theresa May could get worse unless Britain’s charities start persuading more people who are poor, old, ill and from ethnic minorities to start volunteering, a government-funded study says.The profile of Britain’s older population is set to change considerably in the coming decades to include more of those groups, but organisations that require volunteers have failed to attract them and have even sought to remove people who have developed physical or cognitive impairment, the study found.Research suggests volunteering can help prevent loneliness and there is hard data to show it improves mental wellbeing and social connections, but rates of formal volunteering in the UK are significantly lower among black and minority ethnic people and poorer people.“Lots of charities have been complacent,” said Dan Jones, a director at the Centre of Ageing Better, which produced the report with funding from the government’s Office of Civil Society. “It is not that they have been biased. It is just that when they needed more volunteers they asked Marjorie and Gladys to get some of their friends along and they were a lot like Marjorie and Gladys.”Three-quarters of GPs have said they see between one and five people a day suffering from loneliness, and about 200,000 older people have not had a conversation with a friend or relative in more than a month, according to government figures. It is estimated that 4 million people aged over 65 volunteer formally or informally once a month – just over a third of that group.There is also evidence that the “white civic core” that charities have regarded as their workhorses are dropping out of volunteering, sometimes to look after elderly relatives or sometimes because they are becoming incapacitated.“In future the older population will be more ethnically erse and more people will live for longer with long-term conditions,” the report states. “These are precisely the groups who currently face the greatest barriers to getting involved.“We found that people in later life experience significant emotional barriers to getting involved, which is not something that’s been reported for younger people. Fears of ageism, of being rejected or of ending up overcommitted, lack of confidence and a sense of not being welcome or valued can all stop people taking part.”The Centre for Better Ageing plans to test methods of boosting involvement in five areas over the next six months. Grants worth a total of £500,000 will be made to charities that agree to try to bring in volunteers from marginalised groups and create models for lifelong contribution.

St Helens’ Tommy Makinson, described as a “pretty fair player” by Bennett afterwards, is favourite to take the spot but Tom Johnstone laid down a strong claim.The Wakefield winger marked his international debut with a first-half hat-trick which helped put England out of sight by the break. “Tom is someone that I’ve noticed in the last year or so and I’d been waiting to give him an opportunity,” Bennett said. “He’s certainly got a future on the wing for England, although it may not be this year.”Given the under-strength French side, it was difficult to ascertain how ready England are for a New Zealand side who beat Australia in Auckland last week.With Jake Connor, another who impressed here, at the heart of their early play, the hosts at least put France convincingly to the sword.After Tom Burgess opened the scoring with England’s first attack, Johnstone took centre stage with three tries in 12 minutes – two of which came via direct assists from Connor.The Hull utility was also on hand to convert five of the seven tries that made it 38-0 at half-time, with Richie Myler, a brilliant move finished by the debutant Luke Thompson and Elliott Whitehead adding to the scoreline.Thereafter, it is fair to suggest that England eased off somewhat. It took them until 19 minutes after the break to score their eighth and final try, when Connor marked a superb inidual display with a fine finish.To France’s credit, they battled valiantly until the final whistle, and they got the try their efforts merited when Théo Fages crossed on 63 minutes. By then, though, England’s attention seemed to have already shifted to next week and the sterner test of facing New Zealand.There were also lessons to be learned off the field, as well as on. With this being England’s first home game since reaching the World Cup final, it perhaps should have been a cause for celebration to kick off the autumn internationals.Instead, a below-average crowd attended and those who watched on the RFL’s streaming service were left to complain they could not access the coverage. Thankfully, that will not be an issue next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a977df56995b44e996c71e1fedf0b218dc537f9e/262_119_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac63297d213ad07f74ef554ae8fecfdb","title":"nathan hughes suspended for six weeks after what a joke tweet","story":"Nathan Hughes has been suspended for six weeks and is unavailable for three of England’s four autumn internationals next month after his “what a joke” tweet led to two extra weeks being put on to his suspension on Wednesday night.Hughes will miss England’s matches against South Africa, New Zealand and Japan after his suspension was confirmed following a Rugby Football Union hearing that lasted almost five hours. The Wasps No 8 was initially in the dock last Wednesday, charged with punching Gloucester’s Lewis Ludlow in the head, but an ill-timed tweet delayed proceedings until Wednesday night.It had been agreed by the initial disciplinary panel last week that Hughes would face a four-week ban – down from six for his guilty plea and mitigating circumstances – but when his tweet, which was written after he had been informed of his punishment, came to light, his hearing was postponed by seven days. He was summoned back into the hearing but it was decided it could not resume because his lawyer had left the venue.At Wednesday night’s hearing, Hughes was also charged with conduct “prejudicial to the interest of the game”, for which he pleaded guilty.\u0026nbspThe panel opted to deny Hughes the mitigation he had been granted last week because his initial plea of not guilty no longer stood. He was also handed a two-week ban for his tweet – to run concurrently alongside his six-week suspension – meaning he will be available for England’s last autumn fixture on 24 November against Australia.It brings an end to a sorry tale which has seen Hughes delete his Twitter account and the upshot is that Eddie Jones’s headache for the autumn internationals has only gotten worse.Jones’s options at No 8 for the November series were already diminished with long-term injuries to Billy Vunipola and Sam Simmonds and while he would have expected Hughes to be banned, it only rubbed salt into the wounds that a needless indiscretion on social media has cost him his availability for two Tests. Hughes also loses out on two match fees to the tune of £50,000.Chris Robshaw is also unavailable after undergoing knee surgery on Tuesday, meaning that Jones, who picks his 36-man squad on Thursday, may well have to field a back row against the Springboks on 3 November that boasts less than 10 caps between them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8423ef0eda6f5e4133c219917a46285254d6e1/1_0_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2732af3f95d5301d8ea3abe5f31e0a5e","title":"google pixel 3 review android performance camera design","story":"New phone reaches Apple-level of polish, with top-notch performance, fantastic camera and attractive designThe Pixel 3 is Google’s third stab at making its own top-end phone, attempting to outshine the likes of Apple and Samsung with a terrific camera and a highly polished experience.The Pixel 3 is the smaller of the two new Google phones, with a 5.5in FHD+ OLED screen that is bright, crisp and vibrant. It is a beautiful display that is a significant step up from last year’s Pixel 2, with wide viewing angles with minimal colour shift.The Pixel 3 mirrors the design of last year’s Pixel 2 XL with a relatively large chin and forehead containing stereo speakers and various cameras. It’s fairly small by modern standards, making it easy to handle and pocket, similar to the Pixel 2, Apple’s iPhone XS and the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also light at 148g compared to the 177g iPhone XS and 168g Galaxy S9, both of which have slightly larger 5.8in screens.Gone is last year’s coated aluminium back, replaced with two-tone glass. The frosted bit is etched glass, which is super smooth, but is surrounded by polished glass and coated metal sides that aid your grip. The combination feels wonderfully smooth and luxurious in the hand. This is a phone you will want to fondle.In the centre of the back below the glossy panel is a fingerprint scanner as good last year’s. There are no other biometric security options, such as face unlock, despite the Pixel 3 having two front-facing cameras.The bottom of the phone has a USB-C port and a sim tray, while the right side volume button is joined by a mint green power button. There’s no headphone socket to be seen, but the camera only sticks out the back less than 1mm.The Pixel 3 has Qualcomm’s current top-of-the-line processor, the Snapdragon 845, as used in the OnePlus 6 and most other current flagship smartphones, with the exception of the UK versions of Samsung’s S9 and Note 9 and Huawei’s phones, both of which use their own-brand chips.The Pixel 3 only has 4GB of RAM, compared with 6GB or even 8GB in some top-end Android competitors. While it might lose in a game of Top Trumps, it’s not noticeable in daily use because the Pixel 3 is so buttery smooth in operation, with top-notch gaming performance too.The whole system, from switching apps to pulling up the camera, has a level of polish only matched by Apple’s iOS on the iPhone XS. It’s not quite as brutally rapid as the OnePlus 6 in operation, simply because the animations play out for longer, but it’s easily faster and slicker than any other Android device.Battery life for the Pixel 3 is a moving target. Normally smartphones stabilise to a fairly consistent level after a couple of days of first starting them up.That was with consistent use as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music with Spotify on Bluetooth headphones, watching 30 minutes of Netflix and shooting about 10 photos a day.Part of that is undoubtedly down to the Adaptive Battery technology in Android 9 Pie that learns your usage pattern and limits power to apps you don’t really use. It’s possible that over the next couple of weeks battery life may continue to improve, although it is unlikely to be by vast amounts.A full charge via the included 18w fast charger took 101 minutes. The Pixel 3 can also charge wirelessly at up to 10w, which is a little slower than via cable but still faster than some phones charge from their bundled chargers.The Pixel 3 runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, which makes it one of only handful of phones to do so.The main advantages of Pie over previous versions are better notification handling, particularly around do not disturb (DND) modes, wellbeing tool integration for tracking usage and modes to deter usage, such as Wind Down, and great integration of AI systems.Exclusive to the Pixel 3 is Google’s smart compose for Gmail, which takes the advanced autocomplete you might have used in Gmail in the browser on desktop to the Gmail app on the phone. It’s scarily good at writing emails.Google has also removed the traditional home and overview navigation buttons, replacing them by a pill-shaped gesture button in the middle and a small back arrow to the left.The back button still does what you’d expect, but the gesture button does a number of things. Tap it to go home, tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant, flick it upwards once to get to the app switcher or twice to get to the app drawer (you can also go straight to the app drawer by dragging it further up the screen).Dragging the gesture button to the right turns it into a slider flicking between recently used apps as you move your finger across the bar. Flicking the button to the right switches straight to the last used app in the same way a double-tap on the overview button used to.It works fine, but there is a bit of getting used to and I don’t think it’s actually faster than the previous navigation buttons. It also isn’t as smooth and intuitive as Apple’s gesture bar system introduced with the iPhone X, or some other gesture systems used by the likes of OnePlus or Huawei.It is safe to say the Pixel 3 has one of the best, if not the best cameras available today.The rear 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing stunning images, rich in detail, vibrancy and dynamic range. It is better than any other at bringing out detail and colour from high-contrast scenes where there are a mix of bright lights and dark corners thanks to Google’s HDR+ algorithms.Low light performance is also fantastic, and that’s before the promised Night Sight mode that will come in a software update soon, which Google says will be able to produce dramatically better night-time shots.What sets the Pixel 3 apart from the competition is that it can do all this with practically no user skill whatsoever – this is the point-and-shoot that will make you look like you know what you’re doing even if you don’t.Google’s Top Shot works as advertised, using on-device AI to discern if one of the many frames it captures before and after you hit the shutter button is better than your attempt, for when someone blinks or cuts across your field of view.Likewise, Super Res Zoom is far better than standard digital zoom, but can’t quite match the clarity of Apple’s hybrid zoom using the iPhone XS’s 2x telephoto lens at extended zooms.Two selfie cameras adorn the front: a standard 8-megapixel camera joined but a wide-angle fixed focus camera allowing you to zoom out one step. At normal zoom levels the camera captures a stunning amount of detail even in crummy lighting conditions – if you have flaws in your skin this camera will capture them in all their glory.The wide-angle selfie helps you fit more people in, but the images it captured aren’t quite as good.Portrait mode for both front and rear cameras has been improved, particularly around hair, and now with the ability adjust blur both in the background and foreground after the fact. The motion autofocus is also magic, making macro shots a lot easier – tap on an object and the focus follows it around.The Google Pixel 3 is available for £739 with 64GB of storage or £839 with 128GB of storage, in a choice of black, white or pink.The Pixel 3 can be summed up in one word: refinement.Every element of Android 9 Pie is slick and responsive. It’s simple to use but powerful in its execution. From the simply brilliant camera to the auto-complete in Gmail, on-device AI proves truly useful. Plus you get at least three years of software updates, which is still a rarity outside of Apple’s iPhone.The outside of the phone feels luxurious, but in a different way to the iPhone XS. The way the etched glass blends into the polished glass and body looks and feels beautiful.Inside and out the Pixel 3 is more polished than any other Android smartphone, fully justifying Google’s entry into the big leagues.It’s not perfect, of course the battery life could certainly do with being longer, and a glass back will be less durable than metal. There’s also no face unlocking and the relatively large chin and forehead will look dated in a year or so.But there’s absolutely no doubt that if you don’t want a £999 iPhone XS, the Pixel 3 is the best small smartphone going.Pros: super smooth and fluid performance, great screen, squeezable sides, Android 9 Pie and 3 years of updates, water resistant, fantastic camera, wireless chargingCons: relatively large chin and forehead, no expandable storage or removable battery, no headphone jack, battery life could be better, no face recognition"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13067aa35dd50bf522f047579f712c7b3e6d67d1/366_506_5061_3037/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ca60e890eec938754ea8071b3ac8d6","title":"send tip haunted places chance to win a 200  pund hotel voucher","story":"Go on, try to scare us with your most haunted or spooky places to visit across the UKThings that go bump in the night, ghostly footsteps or ghastly apparitions … With Halloween just round the corner, we’re steeling ourselves to hear about haunted day trip locations around the UK, be they pubs, ancient monuments or other “attractions”, particularly if they have a horrific history attached.Please be specific about locations, with websites and entrance costs where appropriate, and ensure your tip stays within around 100 words.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92a1be5dc2ded585f6ba31a44d896c235ea093b2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8101bd6f912867960fec1120d91c632a","title":"joanna lumley and black eyed peas the years strangest tv collaboration","story":"A one-hour spectacular will be a celebration of one of the ‘world’s greatest groups’, presented by their ‘friend and big fan’, Lumley. Who knew?The show, to be broadcast in late 2018, will “pay tribute to one of the world’s greatest groups. Combined with the wonderful Joanna Lumley, this will offer a unique celebration of twenty years of the Black Eyed Peas”, according to the press release. Lumley said that she was both a “friend to and big fan of” the band. “It’s very exciting to be part of this and I’m looking forward to it enormously.”It is, of course, difficult to know were to begin. Who realised Black Eyed Peas had been together for 20 years? Are they really … one of the “world’s greatest groups”? How is Lumley friends with them? Did she ever call Fergie to explain that the bridge in her video for her solo single, London Bridge is, in fact, Tower Bridge? Who commissioned this show and were they very tired and frazzled at the time?The answer to the final question might have something to do with the fact that, as ITV Studio’s creative director put it, lead singer will.i.am is a “much-loved part of the ITV family”. The rapper and producer joined the channel in 2017, when it acquired talent show The Voice from the BBC, on which will.i.am appears as a judge. His contract was rumoured to be worth £2.5m.Lumley, meanwhile, has become a familiar presenting face on British screens. In 2008, she stayed at an igloo hotel during a trip to see the Northern Lights for a BBC One documentary. For ITV, she has fronted more travel documentaries, including her Silk Road Adventures, and a recent series on India. She also succeeded Stephen Fry as the host of the Baftas earlier this year.The Black Eyed Peas, whose current members also include apl.de.ap and Taboo, rose to fame in 2003 with their breakout hit, Where is the Love?, which became the biggest selling single in the UK that year.The band’s other hits include Don’t Phunk With My Heart, Don’t Lie, Pump It, and (unfathomably) My Humps. Reaction to the Lumley-Peas mashup was as expected. That is to say, entirely unexpected. Buzzfeed’s television editor, Scott Bryan, at first assumed the press release was a hoax, and everybody else was equally confused. The jokes came fast on Twitter:The BBC Radio 4 account tweeted that though Lumley appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2007, no Black Eyed Peas tracks made the cut. (Elvis Presley, Wham! and Beethoven did).However, it turns out there is precedent for Lumley’s friendship with the band. A 2014 BBC documentary saw Lumley follow will.i.am around Los Angeles (Joanna Lumley Meets will.i.am). In a trailer still available on the BBC site, Lumley says of her new pal: “He is an extraordinary man … from all the research I’ve done, he just never stops talking.”The two perhaps bonded over their many tangential projects. Lumley’s include a love of garden bridges and advocacy for Gurkhas (which led to a chutney endorsement). will.i.am has a foundation for education in his name, and a tech company that is looking to move into artificial intelligence.No word yet on whether Julie Walters will be interviewing Maroon 5, but we’ll keep you updated as and when."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e49f22d5f31b06d031997ccba88393c1f5fb055/0_579_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b7213bb62534b5a1ff6894ec427694","title":"ann coulter believes the left has lost its mind should we listen","story":"The bestselling author has been criticized for dog-whistling to the far right. Now she’s taking aim at the left – can progressives learn anything from their sworn enemy? In person, Coulter, the bestselling author and personality who has recently taken to comparing the liberal media to cancer cells, is friendly and seemingly earnest. Her face is free of the smirk it often wears in photos, but she has the same long, lean features and razor-straight hair that have been plastered on the dustjackets of so many books, and the same unblinking intensity.Coulter’s authority as an unofficial mouthpiece for President Trump’s base is rivaled only by the revulsion she elicits from progressives. She is not the type of pundit who persuades by appealing to the middle ground. In 2004’s How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), she offered 10 rules: “Outrage the enemy”, “Never apologize”, “Never compliment a Democrat”, “Never show graciousness toward a Democrat” – some of the rules overlap – “Never flatter a Democrat …”During her two-decade career, Coulter has followed these rules carefully. She has accused a group of 911 widows of reveling in their husbands’ deaths lamented that Timothy McVeigh didn’t park his truck in front of the New York Times building argued that the increasing popularity of soccer in America is a sign of moral decay and been fired from MSNBC for telling a disabled Vietnam veteran on air that people like him were to blame for losing the war. (She later said she didn’t know he was disabled.)In response, Coulter has been described, variously, as a human submachine pistol (Lloyd Grove, Washington Post, 2002) a “paid banshee” and “self-drawn cartoon” (David Carr, New York Times, 2003) “She-Devil” (John Edwards, 2007) “Trump’s Aryan Witch Enforcer” (conservative critic Charlie Sykes, 2016) and “troll” (multiple citations).Few consider Coulter a serious intellectual. But she’s a good debater – charismatic, dexterous, always ready with a talking point or quip. She also has an occasional, uncanny ability to sense political undercurrents that others miss.In June 2015, three days after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, Coulter appeared on an episode of the Bill Maher show. She told him that, of the 17 Republican primary candidates, Trump was the one with the best chance of winning the White House. The room erupted in laughter. She then proceeded to tell an incredulous Maher that Bernie Sanders was the only Democrat who could beat Trump.No one is laughing now. But that includes Coulter, because Trump’s first year and a half in the White House have been, well, something less than a resounding success – a fact Coulter attributes to Trump’s failure to fulfill campaign promises, like building a wall on the Mexican border, and, perhaps more importantly, failure to follow her advice.For someone who only two years ago wrote a book titled In Trump We Trust (subtitle: E Pluribus Awesome!), she has become one of his fiercest critics. Last year a meeting at the White House deteriorated into, the Daily Beast reported, “profanity-laced” shouting between Coulter and Trump. (He swore first, Coulter later said.)Trump memorably claimed he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue without losing votes for her part, Coulter, an evangelical Christian, has said she doesn’t care if Trump performs abortions in the White House as long as he follows through on restricting immigration.She still supports Trump, for lack of a satisfying alternative, but living the Trump presidency has been bitterly disappointing. “Every other day I want to strangle him,” she tells me.In her latest provocation, Resistance is Futile! How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind, Coulter argues that progressives, by responding hysterically to Trump, play into his hand. And “the contempt the Democrats have for ordinary people, for what they call ‘deplorables’?” she tells me. “You’ve got to flip that around.”Coulter arrives at a recent radio taping at Compound Media (“the free speech network”). She douses her hands with sanitizer, rubbing her long fingers together, and explains that she has a cold and can’t shake hands or embrace. She offers fist-bumps instead.Coulter is a late riser who usually sleeps till noon, though she makes an exception for media opportunities.She takes her responsibilities as a self-publicist seriously, and works at a relentless pace. While promoting her third book, 2003’s Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism, she gave 160 interviews in less than a month, according to the New York Times’ late David Carr.Coulter and the other guests assemble in the studio. Coulter chews on nicotine gum. Host Bill Schulz opens by plugging her book.Coulter says, “I’ve been a little upset with the president for keeping – let’s see – none of his promises,” adding that her book is “excellent advice for the ‘Resistance’”, though “unfortunately they all hate me with the hot, hot hate of a thousand suns, so they won’t read it.”Trump “doesn’t have a history in politics”, she says later in the conversation, and “he hasn’t thought deeply about a lot of these issues –”“WHAT,” Schulz shouts in mock outrage.The other panelists agree with Coulter’s lackluster assessment of the Trump presidency but there seems to be a consensus that the left’s response is histrionic and will backfire.“These attacks, this stuff from the left – this is what’s going to get him re-elected,” another guest, the comedian Dave Landau, says.Coulter’s sometimes-affinity with Trump is unsurprising in addition to a shared enthusiasm for hand sanitizer, both owe their success to a willingness to say out loud the things other people think in their heads. Those who read Coulter’s books – all have been bestsellers – and devotedly follow her media appearances love her because she articulates suspicions many Americans hold: that the media has a leftwing bias that progressives shut down disagreement by crying racism or sexism that neither party cares about the working class.Her audience is “a narrow band of people”, Carr once observed, “who nonetheless number in the millions”.“Immigrants are great if you’re rich,” Coulter tells me. “You live in New York or LA, you get your pool cleaned. Rosa the maid cleans everything, serves, picks up the kids, makes the beds. Life is grand. But I go out to America. And I knew that immigration was an enormous effing issue that our political class – Republicans for the donor money, Democrats for the votes – was ignoring.”In June 2015 Coulter published Adios America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole. The book argued that unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, was increasing crime, straining the welfare state, and depressing blue-collar wages, and that the media, because of political correctness, and big business, for cheap labor, were preventing honest debate.The book’s most serious charge has since become a mainstream allegation by conservatives: if Democrats have their way, Coulter claimed, they will add up to 30 million new voters to the rolls – overwhelmingly dependent on big government and loyal to the Democratic party. In other words, liberal elites support mass immigration because they are thumbing the scale of democracy itself.Then an interview she did about the book went viral. “I’m in a cab on the way to the airport and I get a text from Trump’s people: ‘Mr Trump would like a copy of your book overnighted to him.’ So I did. And two weeks later he’s talking about Mexican rapists. He has uncanny political instincts.”In the Atlantic, in December 2015, the former Bush speechwriter David Frum described Coulter’s book as the “political book of the year”. “Perhaps no single writer has had such immediate impact on a presidential election since Harriet Beecher Stowe,” he added, in a sentence that might cause consternation to the author of the antislavery novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Frum argued that rosy liberal claims about immigration are not borne out in statistics. Although some immigrants have assimilated well – he cited Nigerian Americans – other immigrant communities suffer from high unemployment, welfare dependency, and educational failure, he said.In an incisive recent piece in Current Affairs, a left-leaning journal, writer Brianna Rennix acknowledged that Coulter was probably correct about Democrats (and Republicans) exploiting immigration for cheap labor and votes. But Adios America! is a “vicious, dehumanizing” book, the review said, and one with eugenic undertones.Rennix added that the book, which cites stomach-churning examples of crimes against women in immigrant communities, seemed more bothered by the fact that these crimes occurred in America than the fact that they occurred.Trump, however, loved Coulter’s book. And Coulter loved Trump. He was, she believed, a kind of idiot savant. When recalling the moment on 16 June 2015 that Trump came down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy, she sounds like a Christian describing when she was born again. She threw all her energy into getting him elected.Two years later, the gold varnish has worn off.But she still loves Trump for his ability to antagonize progressives and the media – whose tendency to overreact, she argues, is what always saves him. This is terrain that Coulter, more than almost anyone, understands.Or as she once put it: “When the spittle starts coming from liberals’ mouths, you know you have struck gold.”Two days after her taping with Bill Schulz, Coulter has another radio show, with Mark Simone of New York’s WOR 710. After a show Coulter often goes to lunch with the panelists, but she is still sick, and possibly still contagious. A social function would invite handshakes, which would be socially irresponsible – and perhaps risk foreign agents infiltrating her immune system and making her sick all over again. One can’t be too careful.Hygiene and physical perfection are preoccupations of Coulter’s. She is fond of the word “retarded” as a term of disparagement (though she has said she would never use the term to refer to “someone with an actual mental handicap”), and in Adios America! writes contemptuously of disabled immigrants. She told me she believes pretty girls are more likely to be conservatives.Coulter does agree to join me at a cafe in SoHo. Since a 2004 pie-throwing incident at the University of Arizona (“They missed, because liberals throw like girls”), Coulter has taken greater security precautions, sometimes including a bodyguard. She navigates New York with a highly developed sense of which areas are “safe” for her – none, really, outside the Upper East Side.At the cafe she glances at the menu but orders only a chai latte to accompany her nicotine gum. “I have a few coastal elite habits,” she says when I raise an eyebrow at the latte.Last December, after Marco Rubio announced that he would not support the Republican tax bill unless it included more provisions for low-income families, Coulter tweeted, “We singles live empty lives of quiet desperation and will die alone. Now Rubio is demanding that we also fund happy families with children who fill their days with joy.”But besides noting, in passing, that she has dated men who drive motorcycles, Coulter declines to say much about her romantic life. She has never been married, though she has been engaged, she says vaguely, “two or three times”. Previous boyfriends include Dinesh D’Souza, the rightwing pundit Trump pardoned for making illegal campaign contributions. D’Souza recently unveiled a new film, Death of a Nation, exploring parallels between Trump and Abraham Lincoln.The only other question Coulter refuses to answer is her age. According to the New York Times and Wikipedia, she is 56. (Coulter tells me information online is incorrect and she has been trying to get a hold of Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, to fix it.)Coulter has an active social life and many friends, including in liberal bastions like Hollywood. Some of these friends, such as a successful screenwriter and producer who asked to be anonymous, keep their relationship with Coulter discreet to avoid falling victim to what the screenwriter called “reverse McCarthyism”.Although she claims to despise the coastal elite, Coulter’s upbringing, in New Canaan, Connecticut, epitomized establishment values. Her father, John Coulter, was an FBI agent who hunted Soviet spies after retiring from the Bureau he became a union-busting lawyer. He met Coulter’s mother, Nell, while working an FBI assignment at a uranium plant in Kentucky. The Coulters were conservative, religiously observant (mother Presbyterian, father Catholic) Americans of Scottish descent, frugal and not given to displays of emotion. John Coulter was “of the old school, a man of few words, the un-Oprah, no crying or wearing your heart on your sleeve, and reacting to moments of great sentiment with a joke”, she wrote in a 2008 eulogy for her father.Discussion during family dinners focused on politics, which Coulter has credited with refining her debating skills.“Father didn’t care what popular opinion was,” she writes. “There was right and wrong.” He was contemptuous of moral relativism on issues like abortion, and she recalls “the look of disgust” on his face when he saw a picture in the newspaper of Senator Ted Kennedy, a Catholic Democrat, praying a rosary.Coulter brought her father’s uncompromising politics to Cornell, where she co-founded the conservative Cornell Review. After law school at the University of Michigan she spent several years doing dreary legal work in New York. In 1995 she moved to Washington DC to work for the Senate judiciary committee.Coulter’s first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton, was a methodical argument for impeachment. In contrast to her later books, the tone and style were lawyerly and self-consciously serious.The book was notable in another respect. At the time, many liberals, including prominent feminists, excused Clinton’s affair with Lewinsky as consensual, or painted Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern, as a power-hungry harlot. Coulter argued that the power difference between Clinton and Lewinsky made the relationship inherently inappropriate and exploitative.(Perhaps to avoid being mistaken for a hero of intersectional feminism, Coulter has since expressed interest in revoking women’s suffrage.)Detractors on both left and right have accused Coulter of using coded language to appeal to the alt-right.In September 2015, during a televised Republican debate in which the candidates kept reverting to platitudes about supporting Israel, Coulter tweeted, with characteristic tact: “How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?”The conservative writer David French argued in National Review that Coulter was dog-whistling to a “very small, very angry crowd that’s far more white nationalist than it is recognizably conservative”. (“Dog-whistling,” Coulter says when I describe French’s accusation. “How original!” She calls French’s writing “stupid” and “boring”.)“In 20 years,” Coulter declared on Twitter last year, “Russia will be the only country that is recognizably European.”“She means white,” a commenter explained, for anyone wondering.VDARE, an anti-immigration website that publishes explicit white supremacists, carries Coulter’s column. The website is named for Virginia Dare, believed to be the first English child born in North America Dare died at the mysterious, doomed Roanoke colony, a fate the group’s founders believe could be prophetic for white North Americans.Coulter is a longtime friend of the site’s founder, Peter Brimelow, and credits him in the acknowledgements of Adios America! (She also credits Peter Thiel.) Brimelow denies his site is racist. It publishes people such as Jared Taylor, founder of the white nationalist magazine American Renaissance, and John Derbyshire, who was fired from National Review for his writing on race.Charlie Sykes, a writer for the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, told me Coulter was once an asset to the conservative movement, but morphed from “intellectually substantive to demagogically sensationalistic, much like the movement itself”. He added: “Her willingness to traffic in racial and ethnic bigotry has done incalculable damage, because she’s normalized it for a huge swath of conservatives.”There is nothing inherently racist about restricting immigration, Coulter says. She calls the left’s attitudes about immigration hypocritical.She argues that the mainstream media ignores serious problems associated with immigration, especially violence and drug crime.Low-skilled immigration “drives down wages for low-wage workers”, Coulter tells me. “Of course it does. What is your counterargument? You’ve repealed the laws of supply and demand?”The journalist Sam Quinones, author of Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, acknowledged this in an op-ed last year. “I recognize the anger of citizens at the bottom of the economy who must compete with those in the US without permission,” he writes. “I don’t like to hear them characterized as racist simply for pointing it out.”But, he adds, Americans enjoy cheap goods and services because of immigrant labor. Trump voters want “to eat their cake and keep it, too”.Sykes argues that Coulter’s anti-immigration, anti-trade, anti-globalization stance “isn’t conservative in any meaningful sense of the word” and “has more in common with European-style popular-front nationalism than conservatism”.“I think what Coulter represents has always been a recessive gene on the right,” he tells me. “But, until recently, it’s been a minority point of view that was held in check.”The auditorium of the politan Republican Club on the Upper East Side is packed to capacity. Late arrivals stand in the back. Everyone chatters excitedly as they wait. The crowd varies in age but skews overwhelmingly white. An earnest man with an eastern European accent strains to see the podium. “I was much closer to Trump and Melania,” he says wistfully, and shows me photographs he took when he saw them in Washington. He glows as if they are photos of his children.Undocumented immigrants are the single greatest threat facing America, he feels. At least “every second one” are violent criminals, and even the ones who aren’t are still here illegally. If it were up to him, he says, they would be eligible for only three “benefits” – immediate deportation, jail with hard labor, or the electric chair.His ideal policy would also pare down legal immigration, almost to zero, “like Japan”, and admit only the most highly skilled applicants, strictly on merit. (This aspiration is somewhat puzzling Japan is in economic and cultural crisis because of its rapidly shrinking population, and without an influx of new blood it may lose a third of its population this century.)Aren’t you an immigrant? I ask.Yes, he says, from Latvia. He was granted asylum during the cold war.

She had left the front door open to allow a breeze in during the steamy weather following the hurricane, as her power was off.The perpetrator snatched her purse even as she was clutching it to her chest while she slept. She said she was so exhausted from trying to survive and fend for her children after the storm that she didn’t even hear them enter.In some areas of the county, spray-painted signs warn “Looters will be shot” and “You steal, we kill”.Stanford says it’s been a stressful time for officers, many of whom lost their homes but are working 16-hour shifts. He says the current influx of resources and officers from other areas will help quell the lawlessness and deter attempted looting.“Most our officers lost their homes, have been working 16- to 18-hour shifts with no sleep, no shower and now they’re encountering armed iniduals,” Stanford told the local newspaper. “It’s a stressful time for everyone in Bay county.”The scope of Hurricane Michael’s fury is still being discovered after nearly a week of missing-persons reports and desperate searches of largely-flattened small towns such as Mexico Beach. Neighborhoods were devastated by the most powerful hurricane to hit the continental US in nearly 50 years, and the most ferocious in recorded history to hit the Panhandle. Cellphone service has started to return to the stricken zone but there are 137,000 customers in northern Florida still without power.Lack of electricity and phone service is hampering efforts to distribute food and water and to contact residents not heard from since the storm hit. Florida officials have not said how many people are missing. The death toll from those killed in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia currently stands at 29 but could yet rise.Many residents of Mexico Beach, where the hurricane made landfall, returned to the decimated town on Wednesday, after they had evacuated and been told to stay away for a week.Some sobbed and clung to each other as they found mere fragments of their homes – structures, belongings and precious keepsakes all swept away by the 155mph wind or huge storm surge. What was considered a charming, traditional Florida seaside town will never be the same again – rebuilding will require up to date codes for buildings better to withstand storms.“Basically, we lost ‘old Florida’, it’s gone,” resident Lanie Eden said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c446f04711a263b5cdbd1ea3bf2e379c20b4210c/0_1658_4189_2513/master/4189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b16d9b95ab7894cf929cf2ed76018d","title":"high school cookies teen grandfather ashes","story":"Two high school students allegedly involved are unlikely to be charged with a crime as principal says it’s ‘a family matter’Police say they are investigating a report that a northern California high school student mixed her cremated grandfather’s ashes into homemade cookies and shared them with several classmates.The Davis police lieutenant Paul Doroshov on Wednesday said two students baked the cookies and shared them with at least nine classmates at their public charter high school near Sacramento on 4 October.Doroshov said the Da Vinci Charter Academy students’ motive was unknown but they were unlikely to be charged with a crime, even if one can be found that would apply to the incident.

They line up in a parking lot for food and water whenever volunteers and church groups stop by.There has been no power in a week, and the water has been out for days. Nighttime means relief from the heat, but also brings the threat of looters. Residents say people have stolen money, jewelry, food and even rain-soaked clothes from rooms ripped apart and left open to the elements by Michael. “Basically, if you were living here before the storm you were homeless. This was our last resort,” said Jeannie Holcombe, who has been at the motel a few months with her husband, Jason. “It’s worse now.” Michael’s winds of as much as 155 mph (250 kph) ripped much of the roof off the two-story red-brick motel, which is just miles from the white sands of Panama City Beach. Rain flooded the upper level and dripped down to the first floor. The place looks absolutely shattered, with tarps strung from the second-floor balcony providing some shade. Rooms reek with the pungent smell of wet clothes and perspiration windows are missing from many. Long-term residents, who pay out about $180 a week a room, abandoned blown-out rooms for ones with fewer leaks or doors that will shut. Other people simply showed up from surrounding areas and settled in. Some asked permission, others didn’t. Joe Donahue, who works for a company that was taking over management of the motel as Michael struck, has been driving store-to-store in search of supplies water, and feminine products for the women. He said he doesn’t mind people staying there for now. “I have no place to send them because everything is booked,” he said. “It’s a nightmare.” Vicki and her husband Wes Allen are stuck at the 135-room motel with their three children, including 17-year-old Allison Allen, who is seven months pregnant. Someone pilfered $21 that was set aside for her unborn daughter, they said. It’s not like it’s a huge amount of money, but that would have been a couple outfits for her,” said Allison, whose twin sister Kristin is also at the motel along with their older brother, Wes Allen Jr. Residents credit their father with risking his life to rescue 10 people during the worst of the storm, helping them leave rooms torn to shreds by the wind. Four family members sometimes use wheelchairs because of back problems. The sidewalks and walkways littered with storm debris make it hard for them to get around. The grassy courtyard is filled with sticky tarpaper from the roof, shattered lumber, empty drink cans and bed linens blown outside by Michael. After getting permission from the Holcombe couple, Bill Yourn resorted to salvaging pennies from the floors and drawers of their shattered rooms. He had to climb through a broken window and walk across a soggy floor littered with shards of glass and personal items like deodorant, hair care products and clothes. “Life’s not great,” he said after eating lunch: a can of tuna scooped with a borrowed spoon. The water came back on a couple of days ago, providing a morale boost, and utility crews are installing new power poles just across the street. But Donahue said the motel is so badly damaged, it wouldn’t be safe to turn on the power even if electricity were available. Residents say police and firefighters have been by to make sure the people are safe, but these survivors say they didn’t bother to report any of the looting at the motel, because the first-responders seem so busy. Someone from Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) also visited, they said, but no one has offered them any better alternatives yet. And so they sit, most without transportation and many without phones for communication, waiting for a fresh delivery of food and water. Some trade cigarettes for other items. One man filled an inflatable kiddie pool, shaped like a pirate ship, to provide a place for youngsters to play. From her wheelchair, Vicki Allen considered their fate. “Six days after Michael came through and tore up everything, we’re still here,” she said. The hero of the American Quality Lodge, Wes Allen, 48, the man who plucked vulnerable residents to safety during Michael, chimed in. “We can’t stay here like this too much longer,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

A no-deal Brexit would also mean “British citizens with a work contract under French law with a French employer could be asked for a document authorising them to work in France”.Merkel detailed a similar list of concerns. She said a no-deal Brexit would bring with it “a whole array of questions, such as how, the day after Brexit, do we manage the estimated 100,000 British citizens who, in some cases, have been living in Germany for years.”She added: “How do we deal, for example, with teachers of British citizenship, who are classed as German civil servants? How do we appropriately prepare our authorities for the added burdens to do with customs issues?”Merkel said her government was equally concerned about the thousands of German citizens living in the UK, as well as German businesses operating there, and how they could be prevented “from facing any disadvantages”.France’s draft bill, first published earlier this month, acknowledges it is “not possible to anticipate” what the outcome of the Brexit negotiations will be, adding that for the time being the talks between the UK government and the EU27 are clearly the top priority.It says any emergency legal steps that the French government may eventually decide to take under the bill – for example to guarantee the rights of British citizens living in France – would depend on the UK adopting reciprocal measures.“The government is very aware of the situation and rights of French citizens settled in the UK,” the bill states. “The government will take appropriate measures regarding the situation of UK citizens in France. It will take account of the status the UK gives our citizens on its territory.”Merkel said the negotiations with Britain had been intense but had demonstrated goodwill on both sides, despite what she called the “unfortunate” lack of breakthrough over the Irish border question.She said it had to be clear to all sides that once out of the EU, Britain could not expect to have the same rights as EU members. “There always needs to be, and there will be, a difference between having membership of the European Union and a partnership with the EU as a third party,” Merkel said.French Channel ports, as well as passenger and freight transporters, are already planning for a no-deal Brexit, which France’s draft bill said would result in “the reinstating of formalitiescontrols on goods and passengers to and from the UK”.Last week Thierry Grumiaux, of the National Federation of Road Transporters, said a delay of two minutes per vehicle for extra customs checks would lead to 16-mile (27km) tailbacks on roads around major French ports. Officials say up to €30m (£26m) investment would be needed to make French ports ready for a hard Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a55873ff8c06bb0b0529d7085eb38fb6c6a862c7/0_56_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aefc1d0ab0d7f0556806fe25848ccfd","title":"golden passports firm was consulted by government over investor visas","story":"Henley \u0026amp Partners among those consulted before rules were relaxed as ministers pursued global investmentHenley \u0026amp Partners, the firm at the centre of the Caribbean passports controversy, was among a group of private-sector specialists consulted by the UK government ahead of changes to immigration rules that led to a surge in wealthy Russians and other non-Europeans securing the right to live in Britain.Theresa May’s Home Office redesigned its visa programme with a view to attracting rich foreign investors, after the coalition had entered government, as ministers pursued investment from global elites.The changes came as the then home secretary was introducing controversial hostile environment measures, with which she hoped to curb overall immigration. “It is possible,” May told parliament in November 2010, “to reduce numbers while promoting growth and underlining the message that Britain is open for business.”Established London law firms, accountants and specialists including Henley were invited to a series of events hosted by civil servants in 2010. Firms including KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, EY, Clifford Chance, Eversheds and HSBC bank were among those who responded to a UK Border Agency questionnaire issued in September 2010 as part of the consultation.The responses informed changes to investor visas, which offer UK residency, that were introduced in March 2011.New features included a fast track for the super-rich and a reduction in the number of days investors needed to spend in Britain in order to qualify. The annual number of successful applicants for the tier 1 investor visa, as the scheme is known, soared from 211 in the year the Conservatives entered government, to a peak of 1,172 in 2014. It was particularly popular with Chinese and Russian applicants.“Henley \u0026amp Partners was one of several firms who attended a roundtable event during the consultation,” the Home Office confirmed.Henley said it had been canvassed for its expertise but told the  it had “never formally advised” the UK government.The migration specialist, which has a head office in London and is run by the Swiss businessman Christian Kälin, has helped turn citizenship by investment into a $3bn (£2.3bn) global industry. Henley made its name marketing passports in St Kitts and Nevis and other Caribbean countries to wealthy foreign investors, and now operates a similar scheme in Malta. has revealed how Kälin exerted considerable influence in the Caribbean by introducing donors to political parties and working on election campaigns alongside Alexander Nix, the disgraced former boss of Cambridge Analytica. Henley has dismissed claims that it interfered in elections for commercial gain as “baseless”.Golden passports and visas are in the spotlight, with European politicians warning that schemes have been used to facilitate money laundering, tax evasion and sanctions avoidance.Britain’s so-called golden visa scheme allows wealthy families to buy the right to residency in exchange for a £2m investment in government bonds or actively trading British businesses. Unlike Malta, the British government does not employ private sector companies to design or market its residency scheme.During the 2010 Home Office consultation, policymakers were told by private sector specialists that rich iniduals were time-poor, and wanted to be able to apply for visas more quickly, according to sources who took part. Lawyers and migration specialists such as Henley, while not directly involved in running or managing the UK scheme, charge fees for helping clients obtain visas. The companies consulted therefore stood to gain if there was an increase in demand.On its website, Henley claims to have “regular involvement in the consultation process with the Home Office and UK Border Agency regarding the Tier 1 (Investor) category”.The Home Office’s March 2011 press release included a quote from Henley. “We applaud the Home Office on the introduction of these new rules,” an associate of the firm said. “With these changes, high net worth iniduals will be more likely to choose UK as their preferred country to reside as the physical presence requirements have been sensibly relaxed.”The redesign doubled the number of days per year that visa holders could spend outside the UK, from 90 to 180. It also offered iniduals willing to invest £5m indefinite leave to remain after three years of obtaining their visa, while those putting in £10m or more could apply to settle after two years. Those not prepared to pay the higher sums must wait five years.However, in 2015 the campaign group Transparency International warned that there were strong grounds for concern that the scheme was being used to launder the proceeds of corruption from around the world. The group pointed out that neither the Home Office nor the banks processing funds from applicants were making proper checks on their source of wealth.Vetting was tightened in 2015, but even today the Home Office has no idea how many of the iniduals who applied for visas fall into the politically exposed persons category. These iniduals – defined as current or former public officials and their families – present the highest corruption risk.In the wake of Russia’s state-sanctioned poison attack in Salisbury, the government announced it would review all 700 visas given out to Russian nationals between the scheme’s launch in 2008 and 2015, because of concerns about money laundering and national security.The Home Office said it had carefully considered a range of responses from open consultation and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders to inform its policy. It added that decisions were taken by the government, taking into account all of the available evidence, and that no outside parties were involved in the final decisions.Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International, said between 2008 and 2015 there was a “blind faith” period during which 3,000 applicants were granted entry to the UK without checks on the source of their wealth being required.“The changes lobbied for by law firms in 2010 which were eventually put into law by the government in 2011 made the UK Tier 1 Investor scheme more attractive both to those with legitimate wealth as well as those with illicit funds,” said Hames.“Due to the increased incentives for investing higher amounts of money, it is likely that far in excess of £3bn was invested through the system during this time.”Hames said it was not unreasonable that stakeholders in visa programmes should make submissions to the government, “but it’s absolutely imperative that government recognise the interests of those companies, be transparent about their submissions and ensure they receive a balanced array of views on the subject”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a898ad06c76ac56c9587072807dcaa6778ce027f/0_467_3801_2282/master/3801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33fa59fbb033939537348b9a986bee9b","title":"norwegian women get apology for reprisals over wwii friendships","story":"‘German girls’ were subject to reprisals after 1945 for relations with the soldiersNorway’s government has officially apologised to Norwegian women targeted for reprisals by the authorities for having relationships with members of the German occupying forces during the second world war.Between 30,000 to 50,000 Norwegians, labelled “German girls”, had sexual relations with German soldiers during the occupation, according to conservative estimates from Norway’s Centre for Holocaust and Minorities Studies.Many of the woman were subject to reprisals by officials after the 1945 liberation of Norway, including illegal arrests and detentions, job dismissals and even being stripped of their nationality.“Young Norwegian girls and woman who had relations with German soldiers or were suspected of having them, were victims of undignified treatment,” Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, said.“Today, in the name of the government, I want to offer my apologies,” Solberg said at an event to mark the 70th anniversary of the UN’s universal declaration of human rights.More than 70 years after the end of the second world war, very few of the women are still alive and the official apology is unlikely to open the way for financial reparations for their families.During the war, more than 300,000 German soldiers occupied Norway, a neutral country the Nazis invaded on 9 April 1940.“We cannot say women who had personal relations with German soldiers were helping the German war effort,” said Guri Hjeltnes, historian and director of the Centre for Holocaust and Minorities Studies. “Their crime was breaking unwritten rules and moral standards. They were punished even more harshly than the war profiteers.”None of the estimated 28 Norwegian men married to German women during the war were expelled or had their nationality taken away from them, Hjeltnes said.In 2000, Oslo formally apologised to the 10,000 to 12,000 children born to Norwegian mothers and German soldiers, who also suffered reprisals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d57868185d53790fb0d0f97c5159c913eba8a4c8/0_34_1791_1074/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b87a701abedb8b0cdb24b9c9b72f049","title":"thursday briefing mays long kiss goodbye","story":"PM hints at extended post-Brexit transition … Trump denies trying to take heat off Saudis in Khashoggi crisis … and the shame of erection failureHello, it’s Warren Murray teasing out the threads you need to be following today.“EU leaders dined on pan-fried mushrooms, fillet of turbot cooked in wheat beer and a trio of fruit sorbets while they discussed their next steps on Brexit following a 15-minute meeting with Theresa May, who was not invited to dinner.” And there on a plate you have the most substantial details to emerge from the PM’s visit to Brussels.As she addressed EU27 leaders, May did make noises about extending the post-Brexit transition period to keep the Irish border open.

One purpose of the leaves is to release hormones that prevent buds from flowering ahead of time.Wada told the public broadcaster NHK that the unusually warm weather that followed the typhoons may have also “tricked” the buds trees into flowering.“This has happened in the past, but I don’t remember seeing anything on this scale,” he said.Wada reassured cherry blossom lovers that there was no reason to cancel plans for hanami picnics when the regular viewing season comes around next spring.While the affected trees would not bloom a second time, the vast majority of Japan’s blossoms would flower as usual next March and April.“The buds that opened now won’t blossom in the coming spring,” he said. “But only a small number of them are being observed. I don’t think it will affect cherry blossom viewing next year.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Royal College of Physicians of Ireland urges mandatory vaccine to protect patients\u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoIpsos MRBI poll finds overwhelming majority backs Varadkar\u0026rsquos stanceOwen Keegan says he is \u0026lsquovery disappointed\u0026rsquo by rejection of proposed \u0026euro10m Dublin schemePolicy of switching to generic drugs never adoptedO\u0026rsquoFarrell and \u0026Oacute Cairbre of Maynooth University honoured for raising public awarenessUncertainties over the future force Portwest to set up distribution warehouse in PolandThat\u0026rsquos Maths: You\u0026rsquod be surprised how many people use mathematics at workPresidential nominees criticise Peter Casey\u0026rsquos comments on the Traveller communitySchool principals say practice is deepening socio-economic ide in Irish educationWhile lifes are increasing in most countries, healthy lifes are notHousing charity says it \u0026lsquoincorrectly characterised\u0026rsquo upfront tenant payment to mediaGarda\u0026iacute estimate that drug haul found in dwelling would have a street value of \u0026euro595,000FF TD becomes emotional as she says she will not opposes passage of legislationEU competition to offer tickets for travel next summerAuditor Peter Smyth to complete review ordered after resignation of Denis NaughtenLeo Varadkar attending EU summit dinner in Brussels as May comes under pressureMen living in direct provision began project in JulyDean Ruxton\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoWhen the Hangman Came to Galway\u0026rsquo born of \u0026lsquopainstaking\u0026rsquo archive trawlHiggins calls for team of local artists to be appointed to provide creative leadChurch recognises fundamental right to freedom of expression \u0026lsquowithin limits\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Shane O’NeillSon PhotographicA businessman recognised as Ireland’s Entrepreneur of the Year 12 months ago, has said his company will be laying off workers in Britain as a result of Brexit. Harry Hughes, chief executive of Co Mayo safety workware producer Portwest, said the company took action after Britain announced 14 months ago that it would be leaving the EU customs union. Speaking at a conference hosted by Enterprise Ireland to mark the start of International Markets Week, Mr Hughes said Portwest currently has a 250,000sq ft warehouse in south Yorkshire where 250 people work supplying its products to continental Europe. However, he said the company, which has a €205 million turnover and employs 3,000 staff in 120 countries, was setting up a 140,000 sq ft warehouse in Poland, due to open in December, as a result of Brexit. Enterprise Ireland chief executive Julie Sinnamon told the conference that the number of indigenous Irish companies taking action over Brexit had more than doubled in the last year. A survey of its client companies found that, as of September 1st last year, only 38 per cent of companies had made provisions for Brexit. By May, the proportion had increased to 85 per cent. She said the dependency of Irish firms on the British market is shrinking every year, with exports to the euro zone rising by 9 per cent last year. The dependence of Irish companies on the British market has fallen from 44 per cent in 2008 to 34 per cent this year, though the volume of exports increased by 50 per cent in the same timeframe.“We are not walking away from the UK. It is and will be our number one market, but we are growing the rest of the world at a faster rate,” she said. Mr Hughes, whose “world-beating company” was praised when he won the overall EY Entrepreneur of the Year award last October, said Portwest would continue to operate its warehouse in Yorkshire as 40 per cent of its exports are to Britain, but it will be on smaller scale. “The net effect is that if you are going to halve the amount of goods going through a warehouse, it is going to have consequences for staff,” he said. He declined to say how many jobs would be lost in the Yorkshire facility and stressed most of those affected would be part-time staff, but he confirmed that the Yorkshire warehouse will halve in size after Brexit. “Nobody knows what is going to happen with the borders or with duty. It’s a practical decision. We are in quite an unusual position that our big distribution centre is in Britain and our biggest market is in Europe,” he said. “Most of our competitors are in the right place. We have found ourselves in the wrong position.” John Brophy, business development manager with the PM Group, an international project delivery company based in Dublin and Cork, said: “We would probably be doing more capital projects if Brexit hadn’t happened. “The multinational companies, which might have invested in the UK, are probably putting their money elsewhere. The nature of the pharmaceutical market is that if you develop a product, you need to bring it to market in a short period of time. Our job is to follow where those projects are going. “The degree of uncertainty means people will not make decisions when they are going to change their strategy to mitigate the effects of Brexit. Uncertainty doesn’t help anyone make decisions in business.” Seamus Lawlor, business development manager with Keltech in Waterford city, a contract manufacturing company specialising in manufacturing fuel and hydraulic tanks, said: “The company has been going over 25 years. We would have been very tunnel-focused on the UK and Irish markets up to two years ago. Two years ago because of Brexit, we decided we needed to look further afield, something which we never did before. “For us it was turning a negative into a positive because, when we approached the European market, we found there was a huge need for our products and our solutions there . . . We feel that whatever happens we will be able to ride it out with that customer base.” Kilian Cawley, director of PE Services, an engineering equipment business supplying into the agricultural sector and based in Cavan town, said: “We cover all of Ireland, North and South, and the UK as well. When Brexit was announced, it was something we couldn’t believe. We had to embrace the reality. I’m from Monaghan. I know what it was like down the years. “We have been trying to anticipate what the worst-case scenario would be. There are so many different facets to Brexit – the movement of people being one of them. A lot of our guys will travel to see a customer six times. “They carry spare parts. All those spare parts would have to be declared. You have a huge issue with the movement of people and never mind the exchange rate risks involved in that.” James Healy, commercial director for Marco Brewing in Sandyford, Co Dublin, which manufactures water bottles and coffee brewing equipment, said: “Brexit has had three impacts on us. The biggest impact is uncertainty. Uncertainty diminishes the market potential for our products. A lot of our products are sold into markets where there is capital spending in hotels and restaurants. The general vibe in the market in the UK in food services is stagnating. “The second impact has been the sterling weakness. That has impacted very strongly and immediately a couple of years ago on our products. “Thirdly you have the whole logistic and customs arrangements post March or post March 12 months. That creates further uncertainty. Our planning is based on a no-deal Brexit. We have to prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

The details of the issue have been disputed.“You can’t please all of the people all of the time,” Mr Casey said when it was put to him that the Traveller community would no longer like him.He added that if a person was offered a free home and declined they should go to the bottom of the housing list.Fellow candidate Gavin Duffy said Travellers were a part of Irish society with different requirements.President Michael D Higgins said the awarding of special ethnic status to the Traveller community was enormously significant, while Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada said Mr Casey’s remarks were offensive.Mr Casey had sparked controversy over remarks he made regarding the Traveller community and his belief they should not be afforded a separate ethnic status.Mr Casey’s comments drew criticism from Pavee Point, the Traveller representative organisation, which called on him to leave the presidential race.Mr Casey, however, countered that the Traveller community had been poorly represented by Pavee Point.Liadh Ní Riada was pressed on her attitude toward IRA violence. Asked in particular to give her views on the Enniskillen bombing, she said: “Any atrocities like that should be condemned” but said the IRA were gone and the new era should be built upon rather than revisiting the past.President Higgins was challenged about not participating in all scheduled debates. He repeated the line that he had to balance his official duties with those of his candidacy.“We said we will do as much as we can,” he said, referring to a number of election appearances he had committed to.“I have been turning up since 1969 and I have stood in every election,” he added.Challenged on his salary and expenses, President Higgins said he took a 23.6 per cent pay cut and had not drawn down either his Dáil or ministerial pensions since being in office.He angrily dismissed several of Peter Casey’s assertions, denying he had flown to Zurich in a private jet and clarifying that a flight to Belfast was deemed necessary for security reasons.“Just add it to the list,” he said, dismissing the claims levelled at him by Mr Casey.The President also addressed the long-running issue of expenses, which has been debated at the Public Account Committee, given their (the expenses)relative lack of transparency. President Higgins said he had inherited the same expenses system that had pre-existed his term in office and that ultimately, all spending was signed off on by the Comptroller and Auditor General.Each candidate was asked to state their position on the issue of salary. Joan Freeman said she would take the entire €350,000 salary but use a portion of it to give awards to community volunteers.Mr Casey said the remuneration should be in the region of €120,000 and that he would give his to charity, while Liadh Ní Riada, in a similar position, said it should be halved.Sean Gallagher said for him the issue was transparency around expenses. He said it was “shocking” to learn they had not been audited under Michael D Higgins for the last four years.Later, Gavin Duffy said it was “bizarre” that three of the candidates had come from the Dragon’s Den television programme. “I can only apologise,” he said.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3666776.1539795514!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ibec cancels event to promote saudi links amid khashoggi controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSaudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi:  was last seen entering the Saudi  diplomatic mission in Istanbul on October 2nd.

Saudi ambassador Nail Al Jubeir was listed as one of the named speakers and Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy was also due to speak.“I would like to advise that Ibec has decided to cancel tomorrow’s joint trade and investment event with the Irish Saudi Arabia Business Council, ” Mr McCoy said in a short follow-up statement.The National Union of Journalists, which had earlier called for the cancellation of the event, issued a statement welcoming Ibec’s decision.“This conference has been planned for some time and it is appropriate that in the worsening situation in Saudi Arabia that the govenrment and Irish companies take a new look at plans to strengthen links with the Saudi regime,” said Séamus Dooley, the NUJ’s Irish secretary.Ibec represents companies employing about 70 per cent of the Irish private sector workforce and is the biggest business lobby group in the country. It has more than 230 staff and 42 trade organisations. The decision to pull the conference follows the decision of several high profile business people to withdraw from a Saudi conference in response to Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance.They have withdrawn from the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi that the country’s crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman hoped would showcase the country’s economic future.Those withdrawing from the event, dubbed “Davos in the Desert” by US media, include David Bonderman, co-founder of private equity giant TPG Capital, tycoon Richard Branson, media investor Arianna Huffington and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase.

File photograph: Government handoutPA WireAn overwhelming majority of voters believe that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar should stick to his position on Brexit and should not compromise to achieve a deal with the UK, the latest Ipsos MRBI opinion poll has found.The poll also shows that most voters are “very concerned” that any sort of new Border would damage peace in Ireland. As European leaders gather in Brussels for talks about Brexit – first with the British prime minister and later without her – the poll demonstrates significant backing for the Government’s position on the issue, which is supported by the main parties at home.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar emphasised again this week that while the State is willing to hear suggestions on how the Border backstop – the guarantee there will be no return to a hard Border after Brexit – is reflected in the UK’s withdrawal treaty with the EU, it will not compromise on the principle of having a backstop. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, as well as EU heads of government arriving in Brussels last night for the Brexit talks, all agreed with the Government’s stance.Asked if the State “should stick to its position of avoiding any sort of new Border or should it be prepared to compromise to help achieve a Brexit deal?”, 72 per cent of voters said that the State should stick with its position.Just one-fifth of voters (20 per cent) said that the State should be prepared to compromise, while 8 per cent expressed no opinion.Support for maintaining a hard line is consistent amongst voters of all parties (strongest in Fianna Fáil), areas, age groups and social classes.The vast majority of voters also say they are concerned that any new Border imposed after Brexit would threaten the peace process in the North.In the survey, voters were asked: “If Brexit results in some sort of a new Border, how concerned, if at all, would you be that this Border would damage the peace on the island of Ireland?”More than half of all voters said that they would be “very concerned”, while a further 25 per cent said that they would be “fairly concerned”.Just 12 per cent said they would be “not that concerned”, while 5 per cent said they would be “not that concerned at all” about a new Border. Four per cent did not express an opinion.Older voters were the most concerned by the prospect of the return of some sort of Border on the island after Brexit.The poll was conducted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week among a representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over, in face-to-face interviews at 120 sampling points covering all constituencies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Ms May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU  could trigger a cabinet revolt. Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergAs Theresa May faced the other 27 EU leaders for the first time since last month’s rancorous encounter at Salzburg, she was at pains to stress the progress that had been made over the past year. She pointed to last December’s joint report, which agreed to put a backstop in place to guarantee no hard border in Ireland as an example of the two sides’ capacity to find agreement under inauspicious circumstances.In her bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and again when she addressed the 27 leaders, May restated her commitment to a “legally operable” backstop. This was not a concession but it was an assurance that Britain is not seeking to resile from the commitments it made last December and in March.In March, the prime minister agreed that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution is found to keep the Border open. Last night in Brussels, she and the Taoiseach agreed that such a permanent solution should be found in the future economic relationship between Britain and the EU.After the debacle at Salzburg and the failure of negotiators to reach agreement on a withdrawal agreement this week, it was important for the prime minister to persuade the other leaders that she is serious about finding a solution to the impasse over the backstop. Last night, she asked for their help in finding a creative solution to the “dilemma” of the backstop.But European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said the prime minister had offered nothing new in her 15-minute address to the ministers. May’s problem is that, with so little political room for manoeuvre at home, any sign of a concession to the EU 27 could trigger a cabinet revolt.Downing Street responded gingerly to the suggestion by Michel Barnier and other EU politicians, including minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney, that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended. Such an extension would give Britain more time to negotiate a trade and customs deal with the EU and make it less likely that there would be any gap that would require a backstop to come into operation.But for Conservative Brexiteers already disillusioned by the slow place of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, the prospect of following EU rules and sending money to Brussels for another year could be too much to bear."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3667031.1539811099!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may asks eu leaders for help with northern ireland backstop impasse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach  Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May during a bilateral meeting in Brussels yesterday.  Photograph: PABritish prime minister Theresa May has asked European Union leaders to help her find a creative way out of the impasse in Brexit negotiations surrounding the Northern Ireland backstop. Addressing the 27 leaders at the start of a summit in Brussels on Wednesday night, Ms May said she remained fully committed to a legally operable backstop to guarantee there can be no return to a hard Border.The prime minister said that, despite the failure of British and EU negotiators to reach a deal on the withdrawal agreement ahead of the summit, the two sides had defied expectations in the past. She recalled last December’s joint report and progress in March and June on elements of the withdrawal agreement and on a transition period.“We have shown that we can bring difficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome,” she said. “The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.”Ms May spoke for between 15 and 20 minutes and then left before the 27 other EU leaders had dinner and discussed the state of Brexit negotiations. Before the dinner, she had bilateral meetings with European Council president Donald Tusk, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, French president Emmanuel Macron and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “I will be talking to leaders tonight about the very good progress that has been made since Salzburg both on the withdrawal agreement and our future partnership. The teams have been working very hard to ensure we can address these issues. We have solved most of the issues in the withdrawal agreement,” Ms May said as she arrived in Brussels. “There is still the question of the Northern Irish backstop. But I believe everybody around the table wants to get a deal. By working intensively and closely, we can achieve that deal. I believe a deal is achievable and now is the time to make it happen.”Asked about EU chief negotiator’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s suggestion that the post-Brexit transition period could be extended by a year, Ms May declined to rule it out. Downing Street said only that Britain was not proposing an extension beyond the current date of December 31st, 2020.In London, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said that a “meaningful vote” in parliament on the final Brexit deal should offer MPs a simple choice between accepting or rejecting it.“Once the deal is presented to parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision, and one which is clear to the British public. Another other than a straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it huge uncertainty for business, consumers and citizens,” he said in a letter to the House of Commons procedural committee.Pro-European MPs want to be able to table amendments to any motion on the Brexit deal so that they are not faced with a choice between accepting an unsatisfactory deal or allowing Britain to leave without any deal.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Mohammed al-ShaikhAFPGetty ImagesHis killers were waiting when Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. They severed his fingers during an interrogation and later beheaded and dismembered him, according to details from audio recordings published in the Turkish news media on Wednesday.It was all over within a few minutes, the recordings suggested. A senior Turkish official confirmed the details that were published in the pro-government daily newspaper Yeni Safak. The leaking of such details, on the same day US secretary of state Mike Pompeo was visiting Turkey, reflected an escalation of pressure by the Turkish government on Saudi Arabia and the United States for answers on the fate of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent dissident journalist who wrote for the Washington Post.Fifteen days after he entered the consulate in Istanbul and was never seen coming out, the Saudis have yet to give an explanation. Top Saudi officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance – denials that they repeated to Mr Pompeo when he visited Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. A team of 15 Saudi agents, some with ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was waiting for Mr Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate the moment he arrived, at about 1.15pm on October 2nd. After he was shown into the office of the Saudi consul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, the agents seized Mr Khashoggi almost immediately and began to beat and torture him, eventually cutting off his fingers, the senior Turkish official said. “Do this outside. You will put me in trouble,” Mr Otaibi, the consul, told them, according to the Turkish official and the report in Yeni Safak, both citing audio recordings said to have been obtained by Turkish intelligence. “If you want to live when you come back to Arabia, shut up,” one of the agents replied, according to both the official and the newspaper. “Horrendous tortures were committed on Khashoggi, who came to the consulate for documents,” the Yeni Safak account said. As they cut off Mr Khashoggi’s head and dismembered his body, a doctor of forensics who had been brought along for the dissection and disposal had some advice for the others, according to the senior Turkish official. Listen to music, he told them, as he put on headphones himself. That was what he did to ease the tension when doing such work, the official said, describing the contents of the audio recording. Such information would not have been disclosed in Turkey without the consent of the government. Turkish media outlets and newspapers are closely controlled: They are either government-controlled or owned by pro-government business executives. Censors are often present in newsrooms, and reporters and editors take close instructions from officials in the presidency.The Turkish leaks implicating Saudi officials in the Khashoggi case have followed a distinctive pattern, beginning quickly after his disappearance. The leaks stopped when President Donald Trump suggested that he was taking the accusations seriously and sent Pompeo to Saudi Arabia for answers.But the leaks appeared to resume after Saudi leaders repeated their denials of involvement to Mr Pompeo, and Mr Trump defended the crown prince as having been unfairly accused. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Mr Trump said the administration had requested access to recorded evidence from the Turkish authorities “if it exists” and that it “probably does”. Mr Trump also said he expected to get a full report from Mr Pompeo when he returned. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleAussie rules and kangaroo for lunch as Duke and Duchess of Sussex tour MelbourneComment: No deal is better than partition, or reducing Britain to a vassal stateTrump pulling out of pact that discounts foreign postal deliveries in move against ChinaIn \u0026#39final column\u0026#39 missing writer Jamal Khashoggi says Arab states can silence media with impunityComment: Donald Trump has captured the Democratic Party and his populist takeover is completeBrexiteers express fury at plan to delay UK\u0026#39s final departure from EU Cobalt airline tells passengers not to arrive for flights as it suspends operationsMost people can\u0026#39t get through a meal without checking their mobile phone, YouGov survey findsHospitals \u0026#39plugging\u0026#39 shortages of nurses by using cheaper workers, experts fear   Focus on slavery is putting black children off history, teachers warnedTeacher accused of having sex with schoolboy on airplane will not face new trial Pre-eclampsia could triple the risk of some forms of dementiaSocial media memes encouraging children to be overweight and lazy, academics have warned MPsOfficers wasting time investigating wolf whistles under drive to target hate crime, police leader warnsTheresa May open to extending Brexit transition period by a year as she asks EU for \u0026#39creative\u0026#39 ideasMock The Week panelist fights High Court battle with ex over right to spread ashes of her daughterUS ready to negotiate free trade deal with UK \u0026#39as soon as\u0026#39 Britain quits the EU, says Trump envoyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anglo saxon era not dark ages british library curator says exhibition","story":"The Codex Amiatinus is on British soil for the first time in centuriesIt is popularly held as a period when Britain and the rest of the world fell into a deep decline.But according to the British Library, the Dark Ages were anything but. The curator of a new exhibition has suggested the term unfairly maligns a time of great creativity and enlightened thinking.Dr Claire Breay said that objects in the once-in-a-generation exhibition, which opens on Friday, show that Britain was sophisticated and pioneering. She told The : “I think people always think of this time as the Dark Ages. At the time, she said, Britain lead the world in areas such as poetry, shown by texts like Beowulf, medicine, and organisation of land and taxes, which is shown by the Domesday Book.Examples of expert craftmanship are on showDr Breay added: “That’s what made Britain so attractive for other countries to invade - it was prosperous and well-organised.“The exhibition shows many examples of just how sophisticated our literary tradition was.“Not only that but the Domesday Book shows the degree of the administrative sophistication we had.”Many of the objects show expert craftsmanship which has stood the test of time, most notably the brightly-decorated manuscripts which still glow and gleam in their original coloured ink.Displayed together for the first time are outstanding illuminated and decorated manuscripts, ning six centuries from the eclipse of Roman Britain in the 5th century to the Norman Conquest of 1066.

cant get meal without checking mobile phone yougov survey","story":"Most people can’t make it through a meal without checking their mobile phonesMost people can’t make it through a meal without checking their mobile phones, new research from YouGov has found.According to a survey of more than 2,000 people 55 per cent said they checked their phone during dinner, while 53 per cent said they look at their phone even when dining out with friends or family.Such is our addiction to our mobile devices that more than half (54 per cent) said they could not go more than two days without their phone before it bothered them, and one in five said they couldn’t cope being without their phone for four hours.In a bid to tackle the growing addiction to electronic devices a number of national campaigns, such as Scroll Free September, were launched to help users cut down on their mobile device use and raise awareness on the addictive nature of electronic devices. Both Google and Apple have responded to the growing debate about the impact of mobile phone use on public health by introducing usage tracking tools features to their devices in an effort to improve digital well-being.Last month Apple launched a new feature on iPhones and iPads designed to limit screen time, especially in children. Two thirds of mobile phone users check their phones while in bed The software update was intended to allow users track and limit the time they spend online to counter smartphone addiction, but hacks were quickly found to bypass the feature including manually changing the time on a device.Meanwhile the negative impact of staying in contact with your device has been well documented, especially when using social media. 5Rights, a children’s charity founded by Baroness Kidron, earlier this year said social media was so addictive for children that the Government should classify it as “social harm” and make it carry health warnings.The new research was carried out to mark YouGov\u0027s partnership with The Future Starts Here exhibition at the V\u0026ampA Museum, which examines Britain\u0027s increasing addiction to mobile devices and how it is changing human interaction.Russell Feldman, director of digital, media and technology research at YouGov said: “It will have escaped no-one\u0027s notice that smartphones are taking over our lives. Across the land, the sight of heads bowed over small screens is now ubiquitous.How to break your addiction to your phone“We can only speculate on the impact this is having in terms of our relationships with colleagues, friends and even close family. But our survey does suggest that traditional conversations are being discarded, in favour of checking our latest email, notification or message.”The YouGov research also indicated that two thirds of mobile phone users (65 per cent) check their phones while in bed despite sleep issues having been linked to the blue light emitted by phone screens and other devices. Almost half of those surveyed also admitted to checking their device when waking up in the middle of the night.Scientists have found that the blue light emitted by electronic devices can trick the mind into thinking it’s daytime and have since issued common advice to switch off all your electronic devices an hour before bed.Some hardware manufacturers have since introduced night light features to lower the amount of blue light emitted by devices in an effort to reduce the impact of late night usage.Mr Feldman added: “What our research shows is just how attached to our mobile phones we really are - and perhaps without even realising it.”Aussie rules and kangaroo for lunch as Duke and Duchess of Sussex tour MelbourneComment: No deal is better than partition, or reducing Britain to a vassal stateTrump pulling out of pact that discounts foreign postal deliveries in move against ChinaIn \u0026#39final column\u0026#39 missing writer Jamal Khashoggi says Arab states can silence media with impunityComment: Donald Trump has captured the Democratic Party and his populist takeover is completeBrexiteers express fury at plan to delay UK\u0026#39s final departure from EU Cobalt airline tells passengers not to arrive for flights as it suspends operationsFocus on slavery is putting black children off history, teachers warnedHospitals \u0026#39plugging\u0026#39 shortages of nurses by using cheaper workers, experts fear   Teacher accused of having sex with schoolboy on airplane will not face new trial Pre-eclampsia could triple the risk of some forms of dementiaSocial media memes encouraging children to be overweight and lazy, academics have warned MPsOfficers wasting time investigating wolf whistles under drive to target hate crime, police leader warnsTheresa May open to extending Brexit transition period by a year as she asks EU for \u0026#39creative\u0026#39 ideasMock The Week panelist fights High Court battle with ex over right to spread ashes of her daughterUS ready to negotiate free trade deal with UK \u0026#39as soon as\u0026#39 Britain quits the EU, says Trump envoyBoris Johnson and David Davis tell Theresa May the British people \u0026#39will not forgive us\u0026#39 for Brexit surrenderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17 october 2018","story":"The golden couple by Marsel van Oosten, The Netherlands, which is the 2018 winner of Animal Portraits,  part of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.Aussie rules and kangaroo for lunch as Duke and Duchess of Sussex tour MelbourneComment: No deal is better than partition, or reducing Britain to a vassal stateTrump pulling out of pact that discounts foreign postal deliveries in move against ChinaIn \u0026#39final column\u0026#39 missing writer Jamal Khashoggi says Arab states can silence media with impunityComment: Donald Trump has captured the Democratic Party and his populist takeover is completeBrexiteers express fury at plan to delay UK\u0026#39s final departure from EU Cobalt airline tells passengers not to arrive for flights as it suspends operationsMost people can\u0026#39t get through a meal without checking their mobile phone, YouGov survey findsFocus on slavery is putting black children off history, teachers warnedHospitals \u0026#39plugging\u0026#39 shortages of nurses by using cheaper workers, experts fear   Teacher accused of having sex with schoolboy on airplane will not face new trial Pre-eclampsia could triple the risk of some forms of dementiaSocial media memes encouraging children to be overweight and lazy, academics have warned MPsOfficers wasting time investigating wolf whistles under drive to target hate crime, police leader warnsTheresa May open to extending Brexit transition period by a year as she asks EU for \u0026#39creative\u0026#39 ideasMock The Week panelist fights High Court battle with ex over right to spread ashes of her daughterUS ready to negotiate free trade deal with UK \u0026#39as soon as\u0026#39 Britain quits the EU, says Trump envoyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prime ministers questions analysis","story":"House of CommonsThis week Jeremy Corbyn -

competitors\u0026nbspface increasingly bleak outlookClick to followThe IndependentProfits at Asos have soared 28 per cent as the online fashion retailer delivered another strong set of results, in stark contrast to many of its high street competitors.While the outlook for traditional stores has become increasingly bleak in 2018 as shoppers switch online, sales at Asos\u0026nbspjumped by £500m to £2.4bn for the year to 31 August.\u0026nbspAsos\u0026nbspshares jumped 15 per cent after the announcement on Wednesday morning, taking its valuation to £4.8bn.\u0026nbspASOS creates sanitary pads for women in Kenya using spare fabricLondon-based Asos reiterated its plans to invest in continued expansion and chief executive Nick Beighton said the company\u0027s potential was “huge”.Asos, which specialises in fast fashion for young people, grew sales by more than a fifth in the UK and internationally, and has delivered 20 per cent increases for three years in a row.Profits came in at £102m, just beating expectations, despite the heavy cost of upgrading its warehouses to keep up with demand.“The potential for our business is huge and we remain focused on building Asos into the world\u0027s number one destination for fashion-loving twentysomethings,” Mr Beighton said.Some analysts had questioned whether the company\u0027s\u0026nbsprapid expansion may be slowing after it reported lower than expected sales in July.\u0026nbspAsos shares drop 10 per cent as UK retailers signal more gloomASOS praised for designing clothing with wheelchair users in mindAsos launches collection with LGBT+ charity Glaad to celebrate PrideAsos vows to ban feathers, mohair, silk and cashmere from siteASOS praised for using unedited photo of model with \u0027back rolls\u0027And despite today’s gains, the company’s share price, which is largely based on expected future growth, is still down around 12 per cent this year at £57.49.But Asos remains the UK’s leading online-only clothes retailer and predicted sales would jump by another 20 to 25\u0026nbspper cent this financial year.Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said Asos was far outpacing the online market as a whole and continuing to keep ahead of younger rivals such as\u0026nbspBoohoo\u0026nbspand PrettyLittleThing.“Unlike some of its competitors that have been blaming the prolonged warm weather for a disappointing performance over the summer, Asos’s sales accelerated in the last two months of FY201718 demonstrating the appeal of its proposition and the loyalty that Asos\u0026nbspPremier drives,” Ms Willmott said.The strong results again highlight the erging fortunes of successful online fashion retailers and their brick-and-mortar rivals.Debenhams, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and House of Fraser have all shut stores and shed staff this year as they try to cut the cost\u0026nbspof maintaining a presence on the high street.“Asos are cutting a dash in a fashion sector that has been looking a little tired recently,” said Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity Personal Investing.“Asos is expanding internationally, growing its market share in overseas territories and should maintain an advantage in its online proposition against rivals that will have to invest heavily to catch up.”George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results should put “niggling worries” to bed. “Asos\u0026nbsphas delivered strong growth despite a weak UK consumer environment,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

Show’s over, they declared, and investors switched off the stock as if it were a bad drama, knocking 15 per cent of its value.\u0026nbspToday it’s hotter than third season of Stranger Things (would you just give us a release date?), with Netflix having smashed both Wall Street’s and its own subscriber forecasts.\u0026nbspIf anyone needed a(nother) demonstration of the folly of paying too much attention to a single shaky set of three month numbers it’s here.\u0026nbspNetflix shares soar after subscriber growth surges at a record rateThe sure-fire hits and movies you might have missed on NetflixIron Fist has been cancelled by NetflixNetflix’s guidance called for 5m net new subscribers to be added to the pile during the last quarter. The number came in at a smidgeon under 7m, a new record for the July to September period.\u0026nbsp“As a reminder the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy in our forecast,” said boss Reed Hastings, in anticipation of taking flak for the company’s prior pessimism. “This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance.”To under promise, over deliver, is smart. The trouble is that Netflix took it to such an extent that it’s made itself look a little silly, particularly given that there were good reasons for thinking that the third quarter would be better than the disappointing second.\u0026nbspIts slate looked a lot stronger for a start, with original content highlights including a new season of Orange Is The New Black, one of its flagships, as well as another run out for animated comedy BoJack Horseman and the second season of crime drama Ozark.\u0026nbspNetflix continues to invest heavily in its own shows, with more than a quarter of the $8bn it is spending on content going to the home team. That means it’s burning through cash at quite a clip, but the move is wise.\u0026nbspCompetition for externally produced fare is hotting up with a raft of new entrants seeking to join the streaming party, some in the US, but plenty elsewhere too. They may make it more expensive to buy things in, and could chip away at Netflix’s numbers,\u0026nbspBut with the way it’s steaming ahead, and with\u0026nbspthe performance of Netflix originals at the Emmys, there is every reason to believe that the streaming giant will cope.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The UK, which currently sits on the UN human rights council, has traditionally been hostile to the treaty, which is supported by Ecuador, South Africa and a number of other developing countries.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of global problems including inequality and climate change.\u0026nbsp“The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet there are very few ways that citizens can hold these corporations to account for their behaviour. Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.

Shares in the company plummeted by more than a third after the firm issued the profit warning. The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits. The company now predicts that it will report a pre-tax loss of £12m for the current financial year.

We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The UK, which currently sits on the UN human rights council, has traditionally been hostile to the treaty, which is supported by Ecuador, South Africa and a number of other developing countries.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of global problems including inequality and climate change.\u0026nbsp“The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet there are very few ways that citizens can hold these corporations to account for their behaviour. Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.

Shares in the company plummeted by more than a third after the firm issued the profit warning. The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits. The company now predicts that it will report a pre-tax loss of £12m for the current financial year. Flybe abandons a planeload of passengers in ItalyBeast from the East wipes £4m off FlyBe revenues Airline competition has benefited passengers, but there are limitsFlybe: “On a path to sustainable profitability” despite higher costsChristine Ourmières-Widener, chief executive officer, said: “We have made progress in driving our unit revenues across the summer season, but we are now seeing a softening in the market. \u0026nbspWe are reviewing further capacity and cost saving measures while continuing to focus on delivering our sustainable business improvement plan.“Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs. We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Rather than Chrome and Google search, as users have seen ever since Android was introduced, there could be something else entirely.The change is good news for other browsers and search engines, which could now come pre-installed on Android phones instead of Chrome.Given recent data scandals from tech firms like Facebook and Google, device manufacturers may decide to make a statement by introducing apps that focus on online privacy.Private search engine DuckDuckGo could be among those to benefit, which currently represents only 0.18 per cent of the global search market.The privacy-focussed search engine processes around 30 million searches per day – the same number as Google handles in about 15 minutes.What does this mean for Google\u0027s mobile dominance?More than 80 per cent of the world\u0027s smartphones run the Android operating system, and this is unlikely to change significantly as a result of Google\u0027s new licensing system.What could change is the pervasiveness of its search engine, apps and other features. Perhaps the\u0026nbspmost significant of the features subject to the fees is the Play Store, which serves as a gateway through which popular apps can be downloaded.Not all apps are available through Google Play – earlier this year, Epic Games decided to roll out the Android version of its hugely popular game Fortnite\u0026nbspthrough its own website in order to avoid paying\u0026nbspGoogle for the privilege of hosting the app on Google Play.\u0026nbspBut this is an exception, not the rule.If the licensing fees prove too burdensome for phone and tablet manufacturers, this way of distributing apps may become a trend that threatens Google\u0027s monopoly of everything from email to maps.Google admits giving hundreds of firms access to your Gmail inboxEven without Google Play, Fortnite was able to amass more than 15 million downloads on Android within a month of launching, proving Google\u0027s app store is not a prerequisite for success.As Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained at the time: The great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that this is possible, now that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Twitter and Google have taken the same approach as Apple and added some kind of filling to their bagels, for instance, but have kept them closed Microsoft and Samsung\u0027s bagels are both plain, but they are cut open like Apple\u0027s one.Emoji that vary can cause genuine problems when people use them for communication. A 2016 study found a significant discrepancy in what the different emoji seem to communicate, and warned that it could lead to serious confusion when people send them across various platforms.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives.

If such an event took place today it would likely disrupt much of the planet’s communication technology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.

TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.“I think it’s fair to say that Caroll’s view of the world and how we should treat each other has shaped and defined our organisation.”Oscar the GrouchShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Searching the site itself revealed dozens of reports of the problem coming in every minute.Kanye West says nobody should know how many followers they haveThe problem appeared\u0026nbspto be with the technology that powers Twitter\u0027s notification systems. The string of numbers – which looks like a hexadecimal string of the kind used in programming –\u0026nbsppresumably refers to a part of Twitter\u0027s code, which would normally be swapped out for something that a human can read but is failing to do so because of a bug.But users reported that the messages are showing even when they aren\u0027t expecting to receive a notification, and without one showing up in the notifications tab of the app.All of the messages appear to be appearing over recent minutes, and only seem to be appearing on iPhones. They are all unique.While they are a little concerning and odd, there\u0027s nothing to indicate that the message refers to any broader problem with the Twitter platform. A number of people took to the site to ask whether the strange notifications indicate they\u0027ve been hacked or refer to some other problem – but the vast number of them received in recent minutes suggests that is probably not the case.Some on Twitter joked about the difficult of trying to work out what the strange messages mean.But others just expressed surprise that people had notifications turned on for Twitter at all.Since this article was first published, Twitter confirmed to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the bug should now be fixed.CEO Jack Dorsey posted that the company is working to understand why it happened, after he tweeted an earlier update that included a screengrab of the problem and was retweeted thousands of times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government must ensure that disabled people who have been so unfairly treated are properly compensated.”Richard Kramer, chief executive of disability charity Sense, said he\u0026nbspwelcomed the news that ministers were getting to grips with the problem, but said it was important that there are no further delays to backdated payments.We must now see reform to a system that undermines disabled people, rather than engages and supports them. This includes an overhaul of the assessment process, which we know can be fraught with error, frustrating and humiliating,” he added.The government said it was in the process of reviewing about 570,000 ESA cases that could be affected, and that it expects to complete the process\u0026nbspby the end of 2019.A DWP spokesperson said: “Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. That is why we have created a dedicated team of over 400 staff to examine cases, and have paid back around £120m\u0026nbspso far.\u0026nbsp“We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A source said they would convene a summit only “if and when” Mr Barnier recommended it was time to do so.The leaders’ decisions are expected to be reflected in an official summary of their conclusions published on Thursday.Ms May had the opportunity to address the leaders before dinner, although she was excluded from the final discussion about the way forward.She told them:\u0026nbsp“We’ve shown we can do difficult deals together constructively. I remain confident for a good outcome and the last stage requires trust and leadership on both sides.”The source said the leaders “stand ready to convene a European Council, if and when the Union negotiator reports that decisive progress has been made”. But they added that “for now, the EU27 is not planning to organise an extraordinary summit on Brexit in November”.Ahead of this week’s European Council, the body’s president Donald Tusk had said the meeting would be “the moment of truth” in talks. However, the emphasis appears to have been taken off the regular gathering, following the collapse of negotiations about the Irish border on Sunday evening.The prime minister held bilateral meetings with Mr Tusk, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Irish PM Leo Varadkar, and French president Emmanuel Macron.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

You’ve got to make decisions about how we get back our brand at being the best for all the issues in the local community not just best for some.”\u0026nbspTories hit by election candidate shortage with activists ‘demoralised’During the recording, Mr Scott can be seen standing next to a powerpoint presentation which displays photographs of bin collections and a council tax form, before switching to an image of a homeless person when he mentions “caring stuff”.In a 45-second clip issued on the day of the local elections earlier this year, Theresa May appeared to follow that message, highlighting bin collection services and the Tory councils having a “record of managing money wisely”.“Delivering those high-quality services, all whilst\u0026nbspkeeping council tax low,” the prime minister added in a video sent from CCHQ’s Twitter feed on 3 May.\u0026nbspSeizing on the recording from the training session at the Tories’ conference, Catherine West, a Labour MP, said it was an “astonishing admission”.“They are telling their campaigners not to mention issues related to caring for people in their communities because they know Labour is better in this area,” she said. “We have a governing party which has given up on caring for people in this country.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

It is universally acknowledged that British music is one of this country’s biggest success stories, with UK artists releasing a staggering one\u0026nbspin 8 albums bought anywhere in the world.For musicians – the protestors include Jarvis Cocker and members of The Chemical Brothers, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, among others – “being in the EU” has played a major part.They point out that no less than 60 per cent of revenues paid to the UK come from the EU, fuelled by a free sharing of data which is now under threat, and that the astonishing vinyl revival is at risk from higher import fees.But, for musicians, it’s much bigger than that. Music is and must be “about embracing and respecting other cultures”, they say – while Brexit will, inevitably, see Britain “isolate ourselves”.“Our concern is that new musicians won’t have the privileges that we had,” says Mr Singh, whose catchy number-one single “Brimful of Asha” was a key soundtrack of the\u0026nbsplate 1990s.Older musicians have grim memories of needing special permission to “get into countries when there wasn’t free movement, but that was a long time ago”, he says.He explains: “Britain is used as a base for touring France and Germany, but artists need to be able to get equipment and people over to Europe and the fear is that will stop because it will be too expensive.”But, for Mr Singh, leaving the EU goes so much deeper than his love for music, because his opposition is an ethos, a state of mind. “Cornershop were anti-Brexit even before Brexit was here,” he says.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchGrowing up in Wolverhampton, memories were fresh of Enoch Powell’s racist “Rivers of Blood” speech\u0026nbspin 1968, which claimed\u0026nbspimmigration would lead to violence and did so much damage to race relations.It’s a controversial view, but Mr Singh insists racism was a “motivation” for some who voted for Brexit, but argues people were also angered by years of cuts – which means they will feel betrayed.“These people won’t be satisfied by what happens after Brexit, because there will be yet more cuts to services, the country will be hobbled by Brexit,” he warns.Here he also targets Jeremy Corbyn for “failing to provide leadership by opposing Brexit”, while echoing claims that EU immigration has lowered workers’ wages here.“Corbyn has gone down the same line and said a lot of the rot that the Conservatives put out – and even Ukip,” Mr Singh protests.“Coming out of the EU is not what’s best for workers and workers’ rights. I find it incredible that Labour doesn’t realise that.”Mr Singh will also be marching because, with a French wife, “we have woken up every morning consumed by Brexit since the referendum”.I’m a former soldier who voted for Brexit- but now I regret itCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendum10,000 young people to lead major demo calling for fresh Brexit voteWhy so many Tory MPs are privately keen on a Final Say referendumShe quickly applied for UK citizenship, which means she is “a lot more secure than others”, but millions of EU citizens here remain fearful about their future rights.“I wonder why many EU citizens even want to stay in the country when you think how badly they have treated,” the singer says. “It is pitiful that it has got to this.”But, with Theresa May still insisting there will be no Final Say referendum – and Mr Corbyn fighting Labour pressure to back one – can Saturday’s march really achieve its aim?“I think so,” he insists. “One year ago, people laughed at the idea of a People’s Vote happening, but, as the truth has come out, the rupee has dropped and people are understanding we must find out what the country feels now.“We now have much more information and people can take a better-informed view about whether we want to leave the EU or not.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hererivers of bloodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But she cannot let it distract her from securing a deal on BrexitClick to followIndy PoliticsThe row over universal credit could not have come at a worse time for\u0026nbspTheresa May. With most of Whitehall’s resources and almost all of Downing Street’s political capital focused on Brexit, No 10 is now also having to stave off growing backbench unrest about the government’s flagship welfare policy.The introduction of the new system has been dogged by delays and warnings about the impact on struggling families. Ministers have already made a series of changes and no one doubts that more will be needed. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons yesterday that the government “will make sure we get this benefit right”. People may ask why, six years after the change was approved by parliament, it has not done so already.Tory backbenchers are increasingly concerned about the policy and the impact it will have on their constituents. This is not a minor reform – the switch to universal credit will affect eight million working-age people. MPs are already being bombarded with tales of people forced into debt, destitution and, according to one Labour MP, prostitution\u0026nbspas they are transferred to the new system.Labour fails to force government to release universal credit papersPolitically, too, the fiasco is damaging for the Conservatives. If the next election is not until 2022, it is issues of public services and welfare that could prove pivotal, especially universal credit, which directly affects more than one in eight voters. The public bought into the idea of belt-tightening when it was needed to reduce the deficit. With the economy growing and Ms May having heralded the end of austerity, that argument no longer holds.The tales of hardship that accompany every debate on universal credit will trouble Tories who fear once again being seen as the nasty party, and fuel perceptions that Conservative modernisers worked so hard to dispel.The disastrous implementation of the policy also spectacularly undermines what will inevitably be one of the Tories’ main electoral arguments: that they are the party of competence and efficient management. The problem is not the concept of universal credit, which has cross-party support, but the implementation of it.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers with a bomb disposal robot on Victoria Embankment opposite Scotland Yard police headquarters in central London after emergency services were alerted to reports of a suspicious packageScottish Power will become the first major UK energy company to generate the entirety of its power from wind after selling its remaining gas and hydro stations to Drax in a £702 million dealPrime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

The result is a policy pushed through on the cheap, without the proper funding and thought needed to adequately implement such a drastic change to the welfare system. Philip Hammond is likely to use this month’s Budget to plough further money into the policy, but it is unlikely to be enough to solve its\u0026nbspmultiple problems.The frustration for Ms May is that the fiasco causing her such a headache is not of her own making. Universal credit was introduced long before she became prime minister. It is hard to believe that, if she could, Ms May would not quietly scrap it and be done. But that would be a huge admission of failure on the part of her government and a major victory for Labour. \u0026nbspUniversal credit is the greatest blunder by a British government yetInstead we can expect further delays as ministers scramble to amend the flawed policy while also staving off the prospect of a parliamentary defeat. With Tory backbenchers warning that almost 30 of them are prepared to vote against the government on the issue, any significant votes on universal credit\u0026nbspare likely to be pushed back until next summer at the earliest. No 10 cannot afford to let this domestic debacle distract from the task of securing a Brexit deal that can command parliament’s support.The government has managed to unite Jeremy Corbyn and Jacob Rees-Mogg, Gordon Brown and John Major, in calling for the full roll-out to be halted.Mr Major this week compared the row to the poll tax crisis that helped bring down Margaret Thatcher. If he is referring to a government ploughing ahead with a deeply unpopular policy that can only cause it further trouble, the comparison is, for Ms May, worryingly close to the mark.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Altogether, there were 188,000 British Army casualties from gas attacks during the war.Blindness, temporary or permanent, was a frequent consequence, adding to the savage toll on men\u0027s vision exacted by bullets and shells.                Father of the Blind \u0026ndash A Portrait of Sir Arthur Pearson                109,000 call for Tommies tax breakIn the four years of the struggle, 31,000 British soldiers were discharged with damaged or defective eyesight caused by war. Of this total, more than 2,000 were fully blind.At first there was only limited support for these wounded heroes, not least because the welfare state was in its infancy and rehabilitation services were woefully inadequate for the scale of the problem.It was to meet the pressing needs of the blinded ex-servicemen that in 1915 the St Dunstan\u0027s charity was established by Sir Arthur Pearson, the philanthropist and press magnate who had founded the  at the beginning of the century.HARROWING:John Singer Sargent\u0027s painting Gassed is based on all too common scenes from the Great War (Image: IWMGetty Images)The organisation took its name from St Dunstan\u0027s Lodge in Regent\u0027s Park, London, where its first headquarters was based. Due to Sir Arthur\u0027s determination to focus on practical help, veterans were given a crash course in Braille and were taught a number of trades, including shorthand, carpentry, massage, boot repair and telephony so they were better equipped for the outside world.From these beginnings, the charity flourished. Renamed Blind Veterans UK in 2012, its pioneering work now promotes independence and a better quality of life for 4,700 visually impaired ex-services personnel, no matter what the cause of their blindness.One former soldier who profoundly appreciates its specialist services and encouragement is Simon Brown. As a corporal in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, he was on a tour of duty in Iraq when he was shot in the face by a sniper in 2006.He awoke from a coma 17 days later in a Birmingham hospital to be told that his left eye had been destroyed and there was little hope for his right. Yet, with the help of the charity, he rebuilt his life and went on to work in the voluntary sector.I learnt to accept my sight loss and with the support of Blind Veterans UK, I stopped being a victim and became a survivor, he says.As the centenary of the end of the First World War approaches, the story of the charity resonates all the more powerfully because yesterday, at Piccadilly station in Manchester, a magnificent bronze statue was unveiled by the Countess of Wessex as a tribute to its achievements.The Manchester statue was unveiled by the Countess of Wessex, here with a veteran (Image: CH)Entitled Victory Over Blindness, one of Sir Arthur\u0027s mottoes, this superbly crafted sculpture depicts seven blind soldiers marching forward, each one with a hand on the shoulder of the comrade in front.The striking image has its inspiration in the iconic painting Gassed, by the American artist John Singer Sargent, who in 1918 had witnessed a line of British soldiers at a dressing station in northern France, waiting for treatment after they had been blinded by mustard gas.On first viewing Sargent\u0027s huge picture, which was 21ft long, Winston Churchill commented on its brilliant genius and painful significance.Chemical Warfare in the 20th century: British troops blinded by tear gas (Image: IWMGetty Images)Both the location and the sculptor of the Victory statue are deeply linked to the cause of the charity.Manchester Piccadilly was chosen as the site because an unceasing flood of wounded British soldiers passed through the station during the First World War, many of them on their way to a convalescent centre at nearby Heaton Park.The creator of the monument, Johanna Domke-Guyot, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1994 and, as a result, has not only blurred vision but also little feeling in her hands.It was like art therapy for me, she says of her epic work, which she began in 2011. The time I\u0027ve had with these seven figures over these years and seeing them come to life has been really amazing.Express founder Sir Arthur Pearson (Image: Ernest H. MillsGetty Images)Indeed, the whole saga of the statue is up-lifting. One of the driving forces behind the project is Blind Veterans trustee Barry Coupe, whose father Des lost his eyesight while fighting in 1943.At the time Des was just 20, an engineer and engaged to be married. But he did not allow his disability to wreck his life. With the backing of St Dunstan\u0027s and his own gutsy determination, he qualified as a physiotherapist, started a family and set up a private practice so successful that his services were used by major football clubs such as Liverpool and Preston North End.If it had not been for St Dunstan\u0027s, my father would not have achieved what he did, Barry told me.The life of the St Dunstan\u0027s founder is just as inspirational. The son of a clergyman, Sir Arthur used his dynamism and gift for innovation to make his fortune in the press, first through a number of periodicals and then, in 1900, through his establishment of the .It was an immediate hit with the public, partly because it was the first national newspaper to carry news rather than adverts on its front page.But amid all this success there was a dark shadow looming over Sir Arthur\u0027s life. Because of the onset of glaucoma he began to lose his vision. By 1913 he was completely blind and forced to sell all his press interests.Yet without any trace of self-pity, he channelled his colossal energies into campaigning for those like himself. For such a man, difficulties were positively attractive and the worst misfortune could have no terror, wrote his biographer.The statue in Manchester (Image: Terry Waller Alamy Live News)St Dunstan\u0027s was his crowning triumph but he also set up the Greater London Fund For The Blind, served as president of what is now the Royal National Institute Of Blind People, and published Braille books.When he died in 1921 aged 55, having drowned in his bath after accidentally knocking himself unconscious, more than 1,800 St Dunstaners attended his funeral, a reflection of the huge affection in which he was held.His courageous spirit lives on through figures such as Ken Facal, who was blinded by an improvised explosive device while on foot patrol in Helmand, Afghanistan, in 2010, but now, thanks to skills training from the charity, works as a fitness instructor.And through 96-year-old Peter Van Zeller, a D-Day veteran who has lost his sight due to glaucoma. Peter\u0027s own father Thomas was supported by St Dunstan\u0027s after he suffered terrible facial injuries when his tank was blown up on the Western Front during the First World War.I may be 96 but thanks to the charity I\u0027m fit, active and enjoy lots of hobbies in spite of my sight loss. Without them, I don\u0027t know where I\u0027d be, Peter said.Today\u0027s unveiling of the Victory statue is another tribute to Sir Arthur\u0027s legacy.For more info or to donate, go to blindveterans.org.uk            "},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1032310_1.jpg","title":"brexit news irish border ireland france emmanuel macron theresa may","story":"                Brexiteer MP pledges to IGNORE the \u0027tidy minds of eurocrats\u0027                 Labour MP grilled for \u0027patronising\u0027 Brexit response in heated debateThe lifeline from the president\u0027s Elysee Palace in Paris yesterday followed fears among officials that today\u0027s gathering of EU leaders in Brussels is unlikely to break the deadlock.President Macron is seen as a key figure in the negotiations whose outspoken criticism of Britain\u0027s Brexit vote led to the Prime Minister\u0027s proposals being rebuffed at an earlier summit in Salzburg last month.But his officials yesterday indicated that fresh proposals for a temporary backstop contingency plan as an insurance policy designed to keep no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could be put on the table.Their compromise included a guarantee the so-called backstop would be temporary but without too precise an end date, the Elysee Palace source said.A tense meeting of Mrs May\u0027s Cabinet spent two and a half hours discussing the stalled Brexit negotiations yesterday ahead of her trip to Brussels.She insisted that a deal was possible, telling her ministers: I am convinced that if we as a government stand together and stand firm we can achieve this.Brexit news: France appears to be backing down over the border backstop (Image: )Ministers were said to have stayed united following concerns some could quit if the Prime Minister went too far in compromising with Brussels.The concerns were intensified after eight pro-Brexit ministers including Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt met over pizzas in Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom\u0027s office the evening before Cabinet to discuss the Government\u0027s position in the negotiations.But insiders said there were no resignation threats at the Cabinet meeting yesterday.Instead, ministers spent much of the discussions focused on how to come up with a mechanism to ensure any backstop cannot become permanent, trapping the UK in the EU customs union indefinitely.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was said to have delivered a masterful contribution about how the EU\u0027s latest proposal for a backstop for a backstop was unacceptable.Following the meeting, the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said: She said we have made progress on a huge number of issues in the negotiations but there remained sticking points in two key areas.The PM said it is not possible for her or any UK prime minister to sign up to an agreement that would lead a customs border down the Irish Sea.Brexit news: Emmanuel Macron may be backing down over the Irish border (Image: )She said we also need to ensure that we do not have a situation where the UK will be kept indefinitely in the backstop against our will.Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, joined a number of ministers in thanking the UK\u0027s negotating teams for their hard work. He said good progress had been made on the withdrawal agreement and on the future framework.Cabinet strongly supported the Prime Minister over the importance of maintaining the integrity of the union.Cabinet also agreed that we must be able to ensure that we cannot be kept in the backstop arrangement indefinitely.The PM said there will no doubt be challenging moments ahead, that is in the nature of negotiations.She said she is committed to ensuring a Brexit that delivers on the referendum results, safeguards jobs and security and which preserves our union.Before the Cabinet meeting, two ministers present at the pizza summit played down suggestions of rebellion against the Prime Minister.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told Sky News: No-one is planning on resigning.We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and that\u0027s it.Brexit news: The Irish border has been the biggest obstacle facing the UK (Image: )We are approaching the end of negotiations. This is going to be a difficult time, but the whole Cabinet is digging in to get the best deal for this country.And Mrs Leadsom said: The Prime Minister is doing a very, very complicated job and I\u0027m fully supporting her in getting that done.EU Council President Donald Tusk attempted to increase the pressure on Mrs May to come forward with new concrete proposals at the summit and claimed there were no grounds for optimism about the chances of a deal.As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr Tusk told a Brussels press conference.However, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible.EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday said that more time was needed to find an agreement to deliver an orderly UK withdrawal and keep the Irish border open.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks, he said.Germany\u0027s Europe minister, Michael Roth, said Berlin\u0027s message to Mrs May was: Take responsibility and be constructive.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Secretary David Mundell could resignNorthern Ireland is granted special status in any EU deal.The DUP and Remain Tory MPs also threaten Mrs May’s survival.Brexit chief Dominic Raab flew to Brussels yesterday for last-ditch talks. We must secure a time-limit agreement for the temporary Customs Union — remaining in it by the next election would stop us from striking any meaningful trade deals outside the EU.Meanwhile, Tories threatening mutiny should consider what will happenthey try to oust the PM. It will spark a bloody leadership battle that will strengthen Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.It could also lead to a General Election in which the Tories will likely be punished by an unforgiving public, irritated at being dragged to the polls yet again.This week the PM must present her solution to the Irish border and reiterate her commitment for a No Deal Brexit, in which our £billion cheque would be taken off the table.And the Tory party needs to stand firmly behind her — for now. Too much is at stakethey implode.BRITAIN has the steepest air tax in Europe.So it is right that politicians are calling on Philip Hammond to slash air passenger duty in the budget.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

They got neither.Both couples claimed other commitments but, given that they all took centre stage at Harry and Meghan’s nuptials and the Beckhams also made the cut for William and Kate’s big day, perhaps they felt this wasn’t A-list enough Instead, we had to make do with, among others, models Naomi Campbell, Cara ­Delevingne and Kate Moss, X Factor judges Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, and actresses Demi Moore and Liv Tyler.Some of whom uploaded gushing videos from the event and Instagram photos of their outfits with hashtag plugs for ­ious clothing brands.At a “royal” wedding  The notoriously traditional Queen Mother must be turning in her grave.There will be the modernisers within the palace walls who regard this as “progress” for a monarchy that, as they see it, must appeal to a younger generationit is to survive.But to my mind, it’s the complete opposite.The pomp, ceremony, tradition, duty and, most importantly, ­mystique of the royals is what sustains them.This wedding — between a “Princess” who performs no royal duties and her Jack of tequila trade — has shone a ­spotlight on the blindingly obvious threat that, once the dutul Queen and Prince Philip are no longer with us, the ­“modern” monarchy will continue to make ever decreasing circles until the taxpayer finally decides, “Hang on — they’re just like us” and the game will be up.With this #royalwedding where even the bride’s mother, left, Instagrammed a designer plug “for my amazing dress” that threat has just come one step closer.RITA ORA is promoting her new album Phoenix. “It’s my first global release of an album.I’m really excited to express my music to the world,” she says.But why the seemingly ­regular need to, er, express her breasts at the same time After all, Ed Sheeran has never posed in just his kecks and he’s sold  squillion records.ANGRY passengers on a flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul intervened to stop Home Office officials from deporting Somalian Yaqub Ahmed.“I know he’s scared,” protested one, before leading a chant of: “Take him off the plane, take him off the plane.”Though probably not as scared as the -year-old girl who was gang-raped in London by Ahmed and two of his equally unsavoury friends – the crime for which he was being deported before these witless do-gooders stepped in.Pitully, the officials capitulated and Ahmed is still in this country awaiting our next move.Meanwhile, as some of the passengers virtue-signalled their liberal credentials by posting footage of the showdown, perhaps they could now be identied and charged with obstructing the course of justice Or, at the very least, be asked to welcome the delightful Mr Ahmed into their own homes until such time as his removal can be rearranged Let’s seetheir liberalism extends to putting their own teenage daughters at risk.PIZZAS and pies must shrink to tackle obesity, claim new official guidelines from Public Health England.Sigh.

I fully support DD [David Davies] as interim leader, she added.Andrea Jenkyns agreed, telling ITVs Peston: It’s ludicrous that it’s two years on and we haven’t got a deal. Extending [the transition] just kicks it into the long grass.And John Redwood said her plans would be unacceptable, saying: I dont think MPs would vote for it.Nigel Farage added: This is another betrayal of Brexit... I dont think she can survive this.He speculated it could mean British taxpayers having to pay an extra £BILLION to the EU.But Tory Deputy Chairman James Cleverly played down the suggestion of extending the transition period - pointing out that it was only a proposal from the EU.He refused to rule it out, but said Michel Barnier put forward a proposal which our Prime Minister and negotiating team will think about.The PM also held separate meetings with Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Irish PM Leo Varadkar today.But despite the high level talks, EU leaders said tonight that despite intensive negotiations there had not been enough progress between negotiators to come to a deal.They said that a November summit was off the cards for now, but stood ready to hold a December one in the hope that a deal could be sealed there instead.No had already given up any hope of forging a orce deal at the summit before it even started.The Brexiteer called the EU “a gravy train soaking us dry”.It had been billed as the “moment of truth” for an agreement before last weekend’s big row.Mrs May also asked the leaders to show “courage” to help her break the impasse.And despite talks stalling over Ireland yet again when a deal brokered by bureaucrats collapsed on Sunday, she also insisted an agreement was possible and appealed for them to come up with “creative” ways to help her.Mrs May told the leaders: We have shown we can do dficult deals together constructively. I remain confident of a good outcome.The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.After she delivered the pitch, Mrs May was then asked to leave the summit room so her fellow national could deliberate over her words with dinner.The PM ed to the UK Representative to the EU’s official residence in Brussels for dinner alone with her aides.Under Mr Barnier’s proposal to extend the transition period, Mrs May must inagree to keep the whole of the UK in an indefinite customs union as a backstop to keep the Irish border opentrade talks to deliver another solution fail.But Mrs May has already ruled that out, and Cabinet ministers have demanded a legally binding mechanism to ensure any backstop is only temporary.Ireland’s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave his backing to the extension as one way of breaking the Irish border deadlock, but only under Mr Barnier’s conditions.Mr Varadkar said: Any extension to the transition period couldnt be a substitute for the backstop.We would still need to have that, but perhaps it would allow people to have greater confidence that it would never need to be invoked.”Some EU leaders began to express open doubts that Mrs May will ever be able to strike a deal with them because of Tory party turmoil over Brexit.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė: We do not know what they want, they do not know themselves what they really want - thats the problem.“If you have on the other side of the table a negotiator who has no strong mandate, its very dficult to negotiate.”Ms Grybauskaitė, dubbed her country’s own ‘Iron Lady’ because of her black belt in karate, added: “The Brits must decide finally want they want, and rally behind the Prime Minister and not split, not battling, to have a joint opinion and joint stance.”But other EU leaders were more optimistic, including France’s Emmanuel Macron who said the EU would “find deals” to secure an orderly Brexit.The French president last night emerged as a key figure of support for Mrs May to break the Ireland impasse, having lead the way in torpedoing her trade deal proposals at a summit in Salzburg last month.Mr Macron was one of four EU leaders that Mrs May held one-to-one meetings with in Brussels ahead of the summit’s start.Another pivotal player, Germany’s Angela Merkel, was also supportive, saying: “We want good relations with Britain.“We would have been happythe exit deal was ready. Instead, we are  percent there.But I will tackle the issues in good spirit and try everything to find an agreement.”It also emerged tonight that Mrs May has invited  chief executives to take part in a conference call on Friday to brief them on the status of Brexit negotiations.The invitations, which were sent out today, are part of efforts by Downing Street to build a closer relationship with business.And in a blow to the PM, French officials today published a paper stating that in a No Deal scenario, British visitors to France would in principle need a visa to enter the country, and would be considered illegal immigrantsthey failed to apply for one.The document also revealed that French ministers are planning to implement new border checks the day after Brexitthe two sides fail to agree a deal.Its the first time a major European country has publicly announced plans for how it would cope with a No Deal outcome.On a crucial day in the Brexit process:At the start of todays summit, some leaders expressed optimism about the chances of a deal - Dutch PM Mark Rutte said: Im cautiously optimistic that over the coming weeks Michel Barnier and the negotiating team in the UK will come to conclusions.Angela Merkel claimed a deal was  per cent done, adding: I’m approaching this with the spirit of always trying to do everything to find an agreement.But Lithuanias president Dalia Grybauskaite said the UK had yet to agree its own negotiating position.She said Britain needs to rally behind the Prime Minister all together and not split - to have a joint opinion and joint stance.And chief negotiator Michel Barnier added: We are not there yet. Brexit must be orderly for everyone and for all the issues, including on the island of Ireland.So we need time, we need much more time, and we will continue to work in the next weeks calmly and patiently.Belgiums Charles Michel said: We are concerned because we see it is dficult in the British Parliament to have the same views on the future of the relationship between the EU and UK.The EU meeting which started today was previously earmarked as the moment when leaders would sign off an a withdrawal agreement.But talks broke down over the weekend after the EU insisted on a border backstop which could carve off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Mrs May told a Cabinet meeting yesterday that she wont accept any deal which which breaks up the Union - or which keeps Britain tied to the EU customs union permanently.And speaking to MPs in the Commons today, the PM said: We continue to work for a good deal with the European Union - a deal that delivers on the Brexit vote but also a deal that protects jobs and livelihoods and crucially that protects the precious Union of the United Kingdom.We will not accept any proposals which would effectively break up the United Kingdom.She accused Jeremy Corbyn of preparing to betray voters by laying the ground for a second referendum on Brexit.Mrs May also rejected the Labour leaders claim that her Chequers proposals are dead after she failed to mention them by name in two recent speeches.Today Michael Gove suggested that a deal might not be signed until December - just three months before we officially quit the EU.He told a Commons committee: It might be the case - we’ve seen how European negotiations work - that progress is made at October council, progress is made at the November council, and it is even as late as the December council before a deal is done.Obviously, everyone wants the deal to be done earlier.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed one of the biggest threats to Brexit is Tory MPs like Boris Johnson who refuse to back Mrs Mays approach.He told the Daily Mail: Boris is a backbencher so he is free to say exactly as he thinks.But what I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether.I am sure that this is last thing Boris wants.The pro-EU veterans made a direct appeal to politicians across the EU, asking them to back calls for a second referendum.They wrote a joint opinion piece which appeared today in a number of European newspapers.The trio said: Our domestic debate is far from over and, even at this late hour, many of us are continuing to make the case that the British public need to make the final decision once we are in possession of all the relevant facts.So we ask our European partners to be ready to give us the space and time,necessary, to make such a final decision.They accused Brexiteers of being cynical pessimists who want to get a flimsy exit deal that they would later tear up in order to impose deregulation and tax cuts.The ex-PM and two former deputies have been blasted by Brexit-backing MPs who say they are undermining Britains negotiating position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442088992.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits set for 230 a year pension boost and more money in your pocket as inflation drops","story":"Pensioners will see a boost of almost £ a week from next April, and hard-working families will start to feel an ease to the cost of living squeeze.Inflation fell to . per cent from . per cent last month, as food and drink cost less.It means hard-up Brits will have more money in their pockets as they gear up for Christmas shopping.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: Food was the main downward pull on inflation as last years September price rises failed to reappear, while ferry prices dropped after their surprisingly high summer peak.However, it wasnt all one-way traffic with energy suppliers pushing up their prices.And yesterday wages were shown to be rising by the fastest pace in nearly a decade -

My father Harry was in the RAF in the Middle East. My Uncle Bob was a tail gunner in Lancasters over occupied Europe. My Uncle Jack, a Guardsman, had been invalided off the beaches at Dunkirk. Even my youthful Auntie Barbara was in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This was total war – the Americans fighting and dying with us, for our freedom. At home it was all wartime austerity. Food and clothes were rationed. Travel was suspended. I ask you to remember because so many have either forgotten or never known the cataclysmic reality of Europe at war with itself. Remember the Blitz on London and Hull. Remember Sheffield, Coventry, Plymouth, Liverpool, Bath and York. Remember, Auschwitz, Treblinka, and the other death camps where millions of Jews were exterminated. Remember El Alamein, Tobruk, Normandy and all the battlegrounds where people gave their lives to free us from Hitler. Remember all these things and consider thoughtfully what must be done to ensure that these horrors never happen again.  The EU brought peace, trade, co-operation and freedom to travel where there had been enmity, rivalry and refugees.It is not perfect, made up of all the flaws of the people of an old, culturally and racially erse continent that historically has more often been at war than at peace. But it is nothing short of a miracle that they found the wisdom to get together in their common interest. I do not care what Theresa May brings back from Brussels, just so long as it keeps us good friends and partners with the rest of Europe.

The Government defeated an attempt by Labour to force ministers to publish its analysis of the impact of the benefits shake-up. Labour described Universal Creditas a vehicle for cuts, but failed in their efforts to push ministers into releasing the documents, by  votes to , majority . Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said UC had been beset with flaws in its design and delivery and was causing immense hardship.  Reacting to the vote, Ms Greenwood added in a statement: The Tories have voted to shamefully cover up the impact that Universal Credit is having on families and people who most need our support. But Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey insisted the Government had taken a mature approach to the roll-out and said it would continue. Opening an Opposition Day debate in the Commons, Ms Greenwood said: Universal Credit, the Governments flagship social security programme, has been beset with flaws in its design and delivery. Its causing immense hardship for many people wherever it is rolled out. It is hard to believe now, but UC was designed to lt people out of poverty and smooth the transition into work to ensure that it always pays. The reality is that UC is a vehicle for cuts.  Ms Greenwood said confusion about the transfer to UC was causing families real concern and that they deserve answers. Labours motion was the latest proposed use of an arcane parliamentary procedure to make the vote binding on the Government by issuing a humble address to the Queen asking her to require ministers to comply. It called for any briefing papers or analysis provided to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions since January   on the impact of the roll-out of Universal Crediton recipients and household income and on benefit debts to be laid before Parliament. Ms McVey insisted the roll-out of Universal Credit would continue, but said she would ensure the Government get it right. We will make sure we get this benefit right. You know for why  Because the genuine concerns of the people on our backbenches want to get it right. She received backing from Tory Heidi Allen , who said she and fellow backbenchers believed the Secretary of State is listening to what needs to change with Universal Credit. She said that makes a mockery of the motion, and told MPs that there is not a single person, myself included, who will vote for the motion. Ms McVey told the Commons that disabled households would be pound better off through Universal Credit, as she defended the Governments approach. She said: Around one million disabled households will receive on average around pound more per month through Universal Credit, andwe were to follow the advice of the party opposite those one million disabled households would be pound worse off. Thats what the opposition are asking for.

North Yorkshire councillors overwhelmingly blocked a Labour motion to oppose the “fundamentally wrong” cut to free transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities . After the vote, councillors gorged on pavlova, roast beef, salmon and a DOZEN dferent cheeses. The council’s now reviewing its spending, which one Labour councillor has slammed. “In these times of austerity foisted upon us by this out of touch and uncaring government, it is imperative that every opportunity to ensure rate payers cash is ploughed back into the savaged front line services,” raged Cllr Tony Randerson. “Not being a cheese eater, I haven’t noticed all these dferent types of cheeses but I have to say I’m rather surprised at the cost of this meal. “I for one will not be partaking in this buffet any longer and will instruct the authority of my position in order that they do not waste food.” The meal, unearthed via the Freedom of Information Act, followed a February meeting where council tax was “reluctantly” hiked up.  Swingeing cuts in the region have so far resulted in libraries closing, buses axed and street lights switched off. At the meeting, North Yorkshire’s Deputy Leader, Conservative Gareth Dadd, warned: “The financial challenges will last well into the next decade.” However analysis of the costs revealed over pound was spent per councillor present on the meal - and some taxpayer’s found the cost hard to swallow. “So they can sit around eating cake and roast beef, but we have to walk home in the dark ” fumed North Yorkshire resident James Wainwright. “We are all in this together - even councillors - so why do they need a dozen cheeses  “Could they not just bring a packed lunch or go get a toastie down the pub ”  In total, pound,. was spent on feeding the  councillors - although almost a dozen didn’t even attend the meeting, The menu at Northallerton’s County Hall included:Seared Chicken Breast with Lemon  herbs Poached Salmon with Lemon  dill mayonnaise Roast British beef and roast ham Greek saladAnd in a further blow to Yorkshire residents, it emerged the council had previously included a smoked Lancashire on the cheese board. “It is asthe War of the Roses never happened!” added James. Over  councillors blocked a motion to tabled by Labour’s Eric Broadbent to stop transport being cut, despite a passionate plea to find savings where. “We believe that the changes proposed to transport for children with SEND are fundamentally wrong,” he said. “Whilst we understand that the Council need to make savings, we believe that this area provides a valuable service to those who are amongst the most vulnerable in society and it is the Council’s duty to exhaust all other areas before removing free transport for young people with SEND. “It is therefore proposed that the implementation of the cut is removed and the funding of the saving gap met from Reserves until such time as more acceptable proposals are developed.” To date, over poundm has had to be shaved from the council’s books. County Councillor Carl Les, North Yorkshire County Council’s Leader, stated: “Our full council meets four times a year and that is the only time that councillors are provided with lunch.

He revealed that vast number of people will be on the benefit by the end of  - regardless of a climbdown that emerged this week. It is a blow just hours after campaigners hailed plans to slow down the benefits rollout to only , people in the first year. Revealing the policy to MPs this week, Tory welfare chief Esther McVey claimed it would ensure the system is right. But today her most senior civil servant said that was not the whole story. Despite ministers easing off, it remains a fact that million people will be on Universal Credit by May  - and million by December , he said.  Whats more, those people are not due to receive any of the transitional payments Theresa May has hailed to stop people losing out. That is because both the transitional payments, and this weeks slowdown, relate to a process called managed migration - which is for existing benefit claimants. That process has nothing to do with new claimants joining the benefits system for the first time. Such new claimants will be put on UC in every area in the country from December , with no transition cash and no delay. And crucially, they will also include current benefit claimants whose circumstances change - eventhey are not new to the system at all.  Much of this we knew already. But the sheer number of people who wont be protected has now been confirmed by the governments top welfare official. Peter Schofield, Permanent Secretary at the Department for Work and Pensions , told MPs: We are currently at about .million on Universal Credit. That will then rise to around about million in May next year. By the end of  it will be around million. So thats my point. Managed migration to one side, the fact that we have rolled out Universal Credit to every JobCentre by the end of this year means all new claims are coming in.  And that builds volumes quite apart from managed migration. Frank Field, chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said Mr Schofield seemed to be in total and utter denial about the problems of UC. Mr Field warned: It’s staggering that he can talk so calmly about millions more people claiming Universal Credit next year, while in the same breath admitting that around one in five claims are taking longer than five weeks to process.” Genevieve Edwards, Director of External Affairs at the MS Society, said she was really concerned vulnerable people will lose out - with some claimants being protected in the rollout and others not.  She added: It doesn’t make sense that a change of circumstance – like moving to an adapted house to manage your disability – could mean a benefit cut. “MS is an often painful and exhausting condition and thousands rely on ESA to live independently, so any loss of support could have a huge impact. The Government has to pause and fix Universal Credit so that disabled people continue to get the support they need.” Committee member Neil Coyle, a Labour MP, added: To move people without protections is an admission the government misled MPs and the public in claiming no one would be worse off under UC. Hundreds of thousands of disabled people and families will be made worse off unless Ministers listen now.  Appearing before the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, Mr Schofield admitted the influx of claimants would be a huge challenge. He said the non-managed migration process would only apply to new claimants, “unless they’ve had a change of circumstances that triggers a new claim, obviously, into Universal Credit. Labour MP Ruth George suggested the delay to managed migration would in fact leave the million people worse off - because otherwise some of them might have qualied for transition payments. Mr Schofield replied: Of course, the advantage of moving forward with managed migration is it locks in the transitional protection you’ve described. He added: You’re right - the poundbilion of managed migration transitional protection is there for people when we managed migrate. . The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Reports of a delay and climbdown this week came after campaigners warned UC was driving people to food banks, debt and prostitution. Managed migration was due to begin in earnest in July  and end in March . But it is now expected to end in December  - the ninth delay to UC - after Tory welfare chief Esther McVey revealed just , people would be migrated across in the first year. Separately, a document leaked to the BBC revealed plans to:Continue paying income support, ESA and jobseekers allowance for two weeks after someone makes a UC claim Reduce deductions when someone is paying back an advance loan from % to % of monthly benefit Give more help to the self-employed after warnings the policy will crush themSome of this, too, would only apply to people who migrate onto UC. BUT... A new, better climbdown could be on the way  Today Tory welfare chief Esther McVey signalled a further climbdown by saying people should keep more of their benefitsthey get a job. Currentlyyoure on Universal Credit, your payment tapers away by p for every extra pound you earn above pound a month. That taper rate has already been cut from p to p, and today Ms McVey hinted it could be reduced further. She told MPs: Under the legacy benefits there were punitive tax rates of over %. We have now brought that down to %. And... we should aim to get that taper rate down even further.

The Unravel podcast states that: The rapes were of such maniacal brutality that even now the police have refused to reveal details on or off the record.  According to a report from New South Wales police in , detectives believed something similar may have happened to Trudie. It is our belief she was kidnapped by two males and murdered, Detective Superintendent Beresford said at the time. As a result of our inquiries, we believe Trudies abduction was sexually-motivated. Furthermore, we suspect there are more victims of these two sexual predators who have not previously come forward to police. Police offered a , reward for information that would solve the case, to no avail. Tragically, Trudie’s mother Connie died  years after her daughter’s disappearance without ever finding out what happened to her. At the  inquest, Trudies father said his we had died of a broken heart.Unravels investigative journalists Ruby Jones and Nick Mercer hope they might find some answers for Trudies family and friends.

Ministry of Defence officials have been ordered to investigate how the shocking rate of birth abnormalities among nuclear veteran children -  times higher than the normal population - could be researched. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is campaigning for the survivors to get a medal, said: “This is a fantastic development. Veterans’ biggest worry is the health of their children, an estimated , of whom live with a shockingly high rate of illness and disability which has never been explained. “The battle now is to ensure that the MoD looks at these problems properly rather than sweep them under the scientic carpet.”  It is the first time in  years of campaigning that a government has considered examining the genetic legacy of Britain’s nuclear bomb tests, which took place in Australia and the South Pacic between  and . Veteran John Ward, , was an RAF typist at Christmas Island in  for five nuclear experiments. He has had bladder cancer, his son Mark has had kidney cancer, and he describes daughter Denise as “a medical mess”. She has problems with her teeth, pancreas, reproductive system, and calcium growths. John, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said: “This is encouraging news and a massive improvement on the MoD’s long-held position of obfuscation and denial. Us old soldiers are relying on Mr Williamson to keep his word.” The Defence Secretary also appears to have slapped down blundering civil servants trying to block a medal. We revealed in August that officials had insisted a gong might depend on proof they were irradiated. But such proof is held by the MoD, which admits its records are patchy and filled with mistakes.  Now in a letter to Mr Watson, veterans minister the Earl Howe has apologised for “the awkward language” and said it was “never the intention” to snub those who served at the tests, many of whom were on National Service. He went on to say the veterans claim “a real dference in rates of miscarriage and congenital defects in their children and grandchildren compared with others” but there were “challenges to rigorous evaluation of such questions”. Although two studies in  found evidence of genetic damage, birth defects and  times the normal rate of infant mortality among veterans’ children, not every miscarriage or abnormality used to be recorded as they are today. He said: “My officials have requested up to date expert advice on possible approaches which is presently awaited.” The minister added the veterans’ case was similar to that for the heroes of the Arctic Convoys, who finally won a medal in . Around , men were ordered to take part in the tests, and only , survive. One dies, on average, every week. To sign the petition for a nuclear medal click here .

Although she adored them both and she and Charles tried to give them equal amounts of love, she reportedly felt that William had been marked from birth for special attention given the fact he will one day be king. Writing for the Daily Mail, Kay revealed how Diana worried about the treatment younger brother Harry got compared to the future heir to the throne. As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry, he wrote.  He claims she told him I have to. Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amountsof our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William. It is not known who the others she is referring to are, but Kay says Diana once told him how she had confronted the Queen Mother over her alleged favouritism. He wrote: One day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother. Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. Its not fair, Harry told his mother. Dianas closeness to both of her sons is something she has always been praised and celebrated for.  She tried hard to make their upbringing as normal as possible, telling palace staff to only call them by their first names and not prince or your royal highness. A fun-loving mum, she also took them on days out to theme parks and roared with laughter as they got soaked on log flumes. In , on the th anniversary of his beloved mums death, Harry said: She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work, but behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. William has previously spoken about the heartbreak of not having his mother there when he had his own children.  I would like to have had her advice, he said. I would love her to have met Catherine and to have seen the children grow up. It makes me sad that she won’t, that they will never know her.

Jamal Khashoggi was last seen inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. Now, it has been revealed Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, an autopsy expert who studied in Glasgow in , is reportedly one of the suspects in the hit squad accused of torturing and killing Mr. Khashoggi, according to the New York Times . Former advisor to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Jamal Khashoggi fell out of favour with the establishment and went into self-imposed exile. The renowned critic of the Saudi leadership, who also worked as a columnist for The Washington Post, was last seen entering the consulate on October  in order to get paperwork to marry his Turkish partner Hatice Cengiz, reports the Daily Record .  He hasnt been seen since. The Middle East Eye reported earlier today that a recording from an anonymous Turkish source captured audio taken from Mr. Khashoggis own apple watch.  The recording is said to reveal his final grim moments, in which he was dragged from the Saudi Consul General’s office onto a table in a next-door study, before he endured a horric seven-minute ordeal as he was butchered alive. The New York Times named Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy among  suspects so far identied by the Turkish authorities. The Times also names nine other high-ranking officials from the oil rich country who could have been part of the death squad involved in Jamal Khashoggis killing. Dr. Salah Al-Tubaigy identies himself on his Twitter account as head of the Saudi Scientic Council of Forensics.  He holds senior positions in the Saudi Interior Ministry and medical establishment, a figure of such stature that he could be directed only by a high-ranking Saudi authority, The New York Times writes. Turkish officials say they possess evidence that the  Saudi agents flew into Istanbul on Oct. , assassinated Mr. Khashoggi and dismembered his body with a bone saw within two hours of his arrival at the consulate. The are reported to have flown out the same day. Dr. Salah Al-Tubaigy was pictured at Istanbuls Ataturk airport on October , raising more suspicion around his involvement in the alleged torture case. He has not publicly addressed the allegations. None of the suspects could be reached for comment.

It was prepared by young chefs being trained by the Mission Australia programme, which assists young indigenous Australians into employment, in many cases giving them a fresh start in le.  Before the meal, they visited the kitchen and met Executive Chef Greg Hampton. Harry joked: “You’ve got a very clean kitchen – is it always this clean  Especially clean today ” Meghan slipped off her Martin Grant trench coat in the warm room before Greg talked the couple through an array of unusual herbs and aromatic spices, getting them to smell and taste them.  “A lot of these ingredients have been here for thousands of years. Our fruits are the same as fruits thousands of years ago,” he explained. Showing them a finger lime, he squeezed out the fleshy contents, explaining: “It comes out like caviar.” “Oh my goodness, that’s incredible,” said the Duchess. But he warned the couple that the Tasmanian Pepper came with a kick, adding: “I don’t want to freak you out!”  Speaking ahead of their arrival, Greg said: “I would hesitate to offer [the pregnant Duchess] the pepper, because they are quite hot. “The first time I tasted one I thought I was having an allergic reaction because the heat creeps up on you. I don’t want to freak her out.” Crushing a leaf of Strawberry Gum, a type of Eucalyptus, he encouraged the royal visitors to smell it. “Is that what Koalas eat in the Bush ” asked the Duke. “Yes, but we can’t eat it in the same way,” replied Greg, explaining how oils from the plant are used to flavour marinades, fish dishes and even ice cream.  The couple was presented with Charcoal Lane aprons for the “touch, taste and smell” experience, but did not wear them. Speaking ahead of the royal visit, Greg said: “We are here to support young Aboriginal people into the workforce, with a view that when they leave this place, there is going to be long-term employment for them,” he said. “I’m not going to turn everyone that comes here into a chef, butthey leave here with a work ethic, it’s a win for us.” Charcoal Lane currently employs  young people for  hours a week as they work towards a Certicate  in hospitality. “A lot of them come from backgrounds where nobody has worked, so this is very important for them,” said Greg.  Programme Manager Troy Crellin said that in  years, the organisation had helped some  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders into work. The Duke and Duchess’s visit to the restaurant began after they admired a mural outside created by Gunnai and Waradgerie man Robert Young to honour the building and the area’s indigenous heritage. He told Harry and Meghan how his Celebration Dreaming artwork references Aboriginal identity, connections and culture in inner Melbourne Fitzroy. Before heading into the kitchen, they received a Welcome to Country delivered by Wurundjeri Elder Uncle Colin Hunter. Mission Australia CEO, James Toomey said: “It was such a fantastic and humbling surprise to hear that Mission Australia’s restaurant, Charcoal Lane was chosen to welcome The Duke and Duchess for a tour, hands-on cooking session and lunch. It is a once in a letime opportunity for the students to meet Their Royal Highnesses. Not too many young people can say they’ve met and served royalty! “At Charcoal Lane, we are passionate about celebrating Aboriginal history and providing students with a culturally safe space to express their inidual identities and overcome any challenges they may face on their journey to employment. Our program not only provides training and real work for young locals, but also fosters a sense of cultural and community pride which we are proud to have shared with Their Royal Highnesses. “We also encourage locals and visitors to Melbourne to make a reservation at Charcoal Lane – there are not many places you can say you ate the same meal as the royal couple while also making a social dference.” FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL TOUR THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT - CLICK HERE The Duke and Duchess are currently touring Australia for the rest of this week, spending much of their time in Sydney. Yesterday, the royals visited Dubbo, around km outside of Sydney, before arriving in Melbourne, Victoria, today for another busy list of engagements. Their tour will also take in New Zealand as well as Fiji and Tonga. During this leg of their tour, Meghan has been banned from visiting the jungle to avoid the Zika virus endangering the baby. The virus is a “moderate” risk on both islands. A palace source said: “They sought out top medical advice.” The royal will be kept away from the rainforest on her first major international tour with Harry.  UK health authorities classy both Pacic islands as having a “moderate” risk of Zika, which can cause severe complications for unborn babies.

But the Duchess may actually be further along in her pregnancy than we previously thought. Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins posted a picture on Instagram that indicated Meghan may actually be four months pregnant. She wrote: What an honour to meet the beautul Duchess today! She was such a sweetheart.  I said I felt sorry for her having to do all these meet-and-greets while  months pregnant! What a trooper. Prince Harry was gorgeous too, a real charmer. He squeezed Lunas legs and said whos this little cutie  Looking forward to telling Luna she slept through it all one day... Its not clear whether Missy accidentally let slip Meghans real due date or just spoke without really knowing exactly when the baby will be born. If Meghan is four months pregnant then the baby will be due in April , rather than May. The palace has so far simply said she is set to give birth in Spring  - so its not totally clear.  As is tradition, the palace will not announce the babys gender or due date until the day of the birth. A palace spokesperson did say Meghan had already had her -week scan, but its not known when this took place. Meghan has been looking radiant on the royal tour so far, and there have been adorable moments where shes been seen bonding with children shes met. Speaking at a reception in Admiral House in Sydney earlier this week, she said she and Harry are ready to begin their parenting journey together. Missy Higgins who recently welcomed her second child, daughter Luna, gave Meghan a really sweet piece of advice. She told the Duchess: Cherish each moment because it goes by so fast. It really does.

But it seems fans werent the only people taken aback by the news - The Duchess of Sussexs nearest and dearest were also surprised by the confirmation that Meghan was pregnant.  According to People Magazine, some of the -year-olds friends were caught off-guard by the timing. A source told them: Her friends knew she was trying and that she wasnt going to wait long because shes older, but everyone was surprised it happened so quickly. Another close friend of the family reportedly said: One or two people were suspicious about the pregnancy, especially as Princess Eugenies royal wedding came around on October . But the couple kept it very close to the chest.  Harry, , and Meghan married in May at St Georges Chapel in Windsor. Since then people have been speculating about the pair having children, with rumours constantly swirling. The rumours were especially re at Eugenies wedding, when the duchess opted to keep a navy coat on throughout the service.

Ashleigh, mum of Edie Molyneux, posted the devastating image on Facebook in order to raise awareness of the condition.Edie, four, is battling Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma , the Liverpool Echo reports.This is an aggressive, and ultimately fatal growth at the base of her brain. The tumour’s location in the centre of the brain means it cannot be surgically removed. And in the UK, chemotherapy is not an option because the levels needed to treat this tumour would poison the rest of the body. So little Edie has to travel all over the world with her family to receive treatment.Ashleighs post, on The Spider-Ede Appeal Facebook page, shows her crying in the foreground as her little girl lies on a hospital bed behind her, hooked to a ventilator. The status also told followers that Edie was doing amazing just yesterday before becoming limp and unresponsive.Mum-of-three, Ashleigh, from Tranmere , said: A picture speaks a thousand words.I have debated putting this photo up. Not because of how I look, that is so far from my concerns. But for fear people will shy away from seeing the real pain.  Yesterday Edie was doing AMAZING, almost off ventilation and taking so many breaths for herself. All of a sudden in the afternoon she started to breathe irregularly, we alerted the medics. The ventilator was turned up and she was given a check over. She had become limp and unresponsive. The doctors took her for a CT scan, the initial thought was that there may be a bleed on the brain. I never thought I’d say “unfortunately there is no bleed on the brain. The only visible culprit is the Tumour. Has it taken anotherfrom our baby   We just have to wait, there has still been no improvement. We pray for a miracle. Explaining why she decided to post the emotional photograph, Ashley said she wanted people to see the hurt the illness causes.  She said: So why did I take this photo  We need you to see the reality of this, the raw hurt it causes. On the exterior we know we look strong. But when nobody is looking, sometimes not even our family, this is the time our worries creep in and we crumble. All of the questions what  why  If  Looking back at the photo is so strange with the “happy” birthday decorations in the background. Just another reminder of how quickly things can change. Edie turned four earlier this week and her family and friends celebrated the exciting day with balloons and her favourite movies. In a post on Facebook Edies family said they were having a day of positivity to celebrate after a fundraising ball was held in her honour at the Hillbark Hotel in West Kirkby. The status was also accompanied by a picture of Edie in hospital with a Feliz Cumpleanos banner hung above her bed. It said: Today we will be filling the day with Edie’s favourites. The wonderful nurse in with Edie today hand made a birthday sign for the wall! Friends have visited and we will see more through the day! Thank you all for your wonderful love-filled messages, we have showered her with love and will do all day. Last nights birthday ball was amazing, we looked through photos and watched videos, playing them to Edie. A day of positivity, complete positivity! Happy Birthday Baby Girl! Finishing off todays heart-wrenching post, Ashleigh said: Please send Edie all of your prayers and positivity. Only she can step up her game right now and push back. She has done it before!

Secondly it could impose journey time limits on transport once the animals had left UK territory. “Both are not possible until the UK leaves the EU. “Were confident that a live export ban or a restriction upon export journeys could be acceptable to the World Trade Organistion, now that a clear framework has been established to ensure regulations can be crafted so they can pass the tests set at the WTO.” "},{"url":null,"title":"americans being tricked voting clever","story":"NewsAmericans are being tricked into voting with clever clickbait - and its geniusSome Twitter users just care way more about the Kardashians than they do about politicsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsThe midterms are coming up \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRegistering to vote is so important - but its amazing how many people dont bother doing it. The fact is, its hard to get people to care about politics. It can be confusing and hard to know what to believe, so some people just switch off. Something lots of us do care about is celebrity break ups and people in the US have come up with a genius way of tapping into that to encourage voter registrations. By using clickbait news stories or sensational headlines about celebrities, social media users are fooling people into visiting vote.org in the hope that theyll register for the upcoming midterm elections - genius.  Some brilliant examples include: Wow I can’t believe this is why Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson split up Someone  posted the link with: omg i can’t believe this is the REAL reason kanye is in Uganda. Another tricked people with this: GUYS ONE DIRECTION IS GETTING BACK TOGETHER!!!!! Its a really smart way of getting people to the website where they can register to vote.However, using deception on social media is controversial, more so since Facebook was accused of allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest the details of its users for Trumps presidential campaigning in .This trend appears to have originated from a tweet by writer Ashlee Marie Preston, who used the link in a post about Kim Kardashian orcing Kanye.She wrote: Welp...it’s official...Kim Kardashian finally decided to orce Kanye West... The link has been clicked on more than  million times, which is no insignicant number when it comes to votes. Whether or not those two million people actually registered or not is unknown, but it proves that this kind of tactic could potentially work.  Despite its effectiveness in getting people to click through to the vote.org website, peoples opinions are ided on the technique. Some thought the idea was awesome, with one writing that its a sneaky and ingenious idea. Others thought it was annoying and unfair. Several people commented to say that the tactic actually worked on them. Maybe well have to try something similar in the UK...

Turkish officials have said they have recorded evidence that he was assassinated by a -strong hit squad who flew in on a private jet.They believe his body was then removed - with one Turkish source claiming the -year-old was chopped up on a table while still alive.But the Saudis have strongly denied the allegations, insisting that Mr Khashoggi left the consulate safely on the day he was last seen. Below, we look at all we know so far about the case.  Who is Jamal Khashoggi  Mr Khashoggi is a US resident and Washington Post columnist who was critical of the Saudi government, calling for reforms. He had worked at the Saudi embassies in Washington, US, and London, and was well-liked by both fellow journalists and diplomats. He was described by one as a warm and funny man.According to Dexter Filkins, writing for The New Yorker , he was also loyal to his principles and refused to compromise his values.This prompted the Saudi government, in , to silence him, claims Dexter, adding that Mr Khashoggi fled to the US last year.  In a move made after Mohammed Bin Salman became Saudi Arabias Crown Prince, the respected journalist relocated to Virginia.There, he penned Washington Post columns and became a prominent critic of Bin Salman, the New York Timesreports.He was engaged to a Turkish woman when he disappeared.Why was he at the Saudi consulate  Mr Khashoggi, a orcee, was caught on CCTV footage arriving at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October . He was visiting the building to obtain marriage documents that would enable him to wed his Turkish fianceacutee. He entered the consulate via its main entrance. His fianceacutee, Hatice Cengiz, who waited outside, said he never re-appeared.  What happened during his visit  There are conflicting claims over what happened at the consulate. Turkish officials have said they believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered and his body removed - an allegation the Saudis have strongly denied. This week, a Turkish source claimed the journalist was cut up alive by a hit squad - who listened to music while dismembering his body. The source, who has allegedly listened to an audio recording of the reporters last moments, said it took seven minutes for him to die.They had come to kill him,” they told Middle East Eye .Mr Khashoggi was allegedly dragged from the Consul General’s office into his study next door, where he was dumped on a table.  Loud screams could then be heard - which only stopped when he was injected with an unknown substance, according to the source. Moments later, his body was allegedly cut up by the squad.According to a report by the NYT , the journalists body is said to have been dismembered with a bone saw brought by the suspects.Saudi officials have denied any involvement in the journalists disappearance, which has made headlines across the world. However, reports have claimed they are preparing a report saying he was killed during an attempt to bundle him out of the consulate. The case has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter, with more media and business executives pulling out of a planned investment conference there this month.  Are there any suspects  Turkey has identied  suspects in the alleged murder - including forensic evidence expert Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy. The MEE source claimed that Mr Tubaigy listened to music via a set of earphones as he chopped up the reporters body. And he allegedly advised his accomplices to do the same. When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too, Mr Tubaigy said in the audio recording, according to the source. At least nine of the suspects worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries, according to the NYT.  It is alleged they flew out the same day as the killing, and brought the bone saw with them for the purpose of cutting up Mr Khashoggis body. Records allegedly show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi firm arrived and departed from Istanbul on October . The latest claims follow US media reports that Saudi Arabia will admit the vanished journalist died following a botched interrogation. What does Donald Trump say US President Donald Trump earlier sensationally gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt in Mr Khashoggis disappearance.US lawmakers have pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership, while Western pressure has mounted on Riyadh to provide answers. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mr Trump saidSaudi Arabia knew what happened in the disappearance, that would be bad. I think we have to find out what happened first, he said yesterday.  Speaking to reporters, he also drew comparisons with the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court scandal, adding: Here we go again with, you know, youre guilty until proven innocent. I dont like that. Mr Trump had earlier posted a Tweet saying that Bin Salman denied knowing what happened in the Saudi consulate. The president has suggested that rogue killers could have been involved in the case. However, such a move without sanction from the Saudi regime is believed to be highly unlikely by many. And how about Turkey  Today, Turkeys foreign minister said the country hoped to enter the Saudi consuls residence in connection with the case. Turkish police had been expected to search the building yesterday. However, they did not do so, officers at the scene said last night, because Saudi officials were not able to join them. Hours earlier, the consul general left Turkey for Riyadh. Yesterday evening, unfortunately, police could not search the Saudi consuls residence, Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters today after meeting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Ankara.  He added: We hope the police will enter to the residence today. We have said before that Saudi Arabia must cooperate with us in every aspect without delay. Mr Cavusoglu, who said the search would extend to the consuls vehicles, said the consul was free to travel home and had not been deported. He also said talks with Mr Pompeo were beneficial and fruitful. Mr Pompeo was on a brief visit to Turkey after having met with the Saudi king, crown prince and foreign minister in Riyadh yesterday. Turkish crime scene investigators had carried out a nine-hour search of the consulate on Monday night as part of the probe. Last Saturday, a Turkish newspaper reported that recordings made on Mr Khashoggis Apple Watch - had been uncovered by investigators.  These recordings allegedly indicated he was tortured and killed, but the report in the Sabah daily could not immediately be veried. “The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watch’s memory,” the paper said. It added that the watch had synched with the journalists iPhone, which his fiancee was carrying outside the consulate. However, technology experts have said it is highly unlikely the watch could have recorded actions inside the embassy and uploaded them to an iCloud account. And the Saudis  Saudi officials have denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggis disappearance and have claimed he left the consulate safely. After meeting with King Salman and the crown prince yesterday, Mr Pompeo told reporters that Saudi Arabia has committed to conducting a complete investigation into the case. In each of those meetings I stressed the importance of them conducting a complete investigation into the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, he told reporters.  They made a commitment to do that. He added: They said it would be a thorough, complete and transparent investigation. They indicated they understood that getting that done in a timely, rapid fashion so they could begin to answer important questions. Asked whether they said Mr Khashoggi was alive or dead, Mr Pompeo said: They didnt talk about any of the facts. Last Thursday, Turkey said it and Saudi Arabia had agreed to form a joint working group - at Riyadh’s initiative - to investigate the case. A Saudi source said a senior royal, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, had visited Turkey that day.  And the following day, SPA said that Saudi Arabia’s interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Na, condemned the “lies and baseless allegations” against the kingdom. However, he apparently praised the joint investigation with Turkey. Has the UK issued a statement  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his G counterparts have said they are very troubled by Mr Khashoggis disappearance. They have insisted those responsible must be held to account. In an earlier statement, the G foreign ministers said: We, the G foreign ministers, of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, affirm our commitment to defending freedom of expression and protection of a free press.  We remain very troubled by the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account. We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation, as announced. Mr Hunt has said previously that questions remain about the case that only Saudi Arabia can answer. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said Britain expected the Saudi government to provide a detailed response to questions over Mr Khashoggis disappearance. “We expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response,” the spokesman told reporters.  What do Mr Khashoggis relatives say  In a heartbreaking statement released on Monday, members of Mr Khashoggis family called for an investigation. We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago, they said. The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.

Once inside, he is said to have been tortured by the squad - allegedly including a Dr Death and a man with ties to the Saudi Crown Prince. He had his fingers brutally torn off as his killers spent seven minutes murdering him and dismembering his body, media reports claim. Chilling audio footage, taken that day, reportedly captures Saudi Arabias Consul General telling the suspects to do this outside. According to Yeni Safak , a strongly pro-government newspaper, Mohammed al-Otaibi adds: Youre going to get me in trouble.In response, one of the Saudi suspects allegedly replies: Shut upyou want to live when youtoArabia. Today, it emerged Mr al-Otaibi has been relieved of his post, according to an official statement carried by the Sabq newspaper. He will be investigated, although the Saudi online newspaper did not give details of the violations he is being investigated for. Turkish officials say they believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered and his body removed - an allegation the Saudis have strongly denied. The recording allegedly capturing the well-liked journalist being tortured and butchered alive has not been released to the public. But Sky News reports that a very well placed source says the Consul General and Mr Khashoggi can be heard speaking in audio footage.After this, there was a beating, the source claimed, adding that the footage later revealed the reporter was drugged and killed. The killing is said to have taken seven agonising minutes.We earlier reported how members of the hit squad reportedly listened to music through earphones as they dismembered their victim. A Turkish source, who has allegedly listened to an audio clip of the incident, told Middle East Eye : They had come to kill him. It was claimed that Mr Khashoggi was dragged from the Consul Generals office into his study next door, where he was dumped on a table. Loud screams could then be heard - which only stopped when he was injected with an unknown substance, according to the source. Moments later, his body was allegedly cut up - while he was still alive. Forensic evidence expert Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, dubbed Dr Death, has been identied by Turkey as a suspect in the killing. The source told MEE that Tubaigy listened to music via earphones as he cut up the reporters body while he was still breathing. He allegedly advised his accomplices to do the same. When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too, Tubaigy could be heard saying in the recording, the source said. According to Yeni Safak, Mr Khashoggi was told to shut up at one point during his ordeal, which also allegedly saw his head cut.  Today, another suspect in the Turkish police probe into the case was confirmed as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a Saudi diplomat. It is thought Mutreb may have worked as a bodyguard for Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, whom he travelled extensively with.He used to work as a diplomat at the Saudi Embassy in London, according to the New York Times , which says several other suspects have been linked by witnesses and records to Bin Salmans security detail.The newspaper states that at least nine of the suspects worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries. It is alleged they flew out the same day as the killing, and brought a bone saw with them for the purpose of cutting up Mr Khashoggis body. Records allegedly show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi firm arrived and departed from Istanbul on October .  Mr Khashoggi has so far been missing for  days.

I thought it was a good performance, especially in the first half.“It didn’t feel like a - defeat, so it was a bit disappointing coming off with that scoreline but it was good to get the goal at the end.”The former Partick Thistle and Wigan centre-half has been pleased with his own progress in the blue of Scotland lately after picking up his third cap.He hopes that, alongside defensive partner McKenna, there are many more to come in the months and years ahead as Alex McLeish’s side look to get their Nations League campaign back on track as they travel to Albania and Israel come to Hampden next month.“In my first two caps I think I played very well and again last night, apart from near the end where I gave the ball away and it led to a goal, I thought I had a solid performance.“I’m taking everything in my stride, trying to keep learning and, hopefully, building on it. Scott’s a talented player and it’s good to see that kind of talent coming through the Scotland ranks. We work well as a partnership and we work well with each other so, hopefully, that can grow.“With the facilities, the coaching staff and the players around you at Celtic and with Scotland you’re always going to kick on as long as you put the work in, which I’m doing.

For the first time in a while, there was a spark and energy about the team that suggests they have the quality to mount a strong and successful promotion challenge.Having suggested that, through no fault of Neilson or his players, this was maybe not the best game on which to judge them.While United’s play for most of the proceedings was excellent, there is no doubt in Thistle they were facing a beleaguered outfit that looks to still be coming to terms with a relegation.Two games against the Tangerines this season have seen them well-beaten and fortunate the margin of their defeats were not considerably greater. They are in the process of finding a new manager to replace Alan Archibald and it’s clear the man who comes in has a very big job on his hands.As the old adage goes, however, Neilson and his players could only beat what was put in front of them and in his first game in charge victory was achieved in some style.And aspects of the performance mean Arabs do have good reason to feel optimistic about their team’s prospects.After just a few days working with the new boss, Saturday saw a United team that looked reinvigorated and one that, apparently, had a clear idea of what the game plan was. Too often that was not the case under his predecessor Laszlo.That produced a top performance and fine inidual displays, not least from man-of-the-match Paul McMullan.Less than two months ago it appeared his time at Tannadice could be up. On the evidence of his display at Thistle, the former Scotland U  could now be ready to show why McKinnon battled so hard to get him.Andthe work he, and others, did on the ball gave plenty of reason to look forward to the games that lie ahead, so too did the ferocious way the entire team battled to get it back when Partick had possession.Particularly under Laszlo, opposing teams were given too much time in possession, but now United look like a side that will get the ball back quickly.It’s why, while not getting ahead of themselves, United fans can again feel hopeful about their team."},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-theresa-mays-policies-are-damaging-lives-and-glasgow-is-next","story":"THIS time last week, the SNPrsquos annual conference brought around , visitors to this city, providing a huge boost to hotels, restaurants and bars."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-independence-supporters-launch-new-funding-bid-to-secure-support-for-the-cause","story":"Independence supporters have launched a new fundraising drive aimed at building majority support for the cause."},{"url":null,"title":"five-takeaways-in-and-around-glasgow-set-to-compete-for-best-in-scotland","story":"FIVE takeaways in and around Glasgow are set to head to London to battle-it-out for the best in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"lanarkshire-detectives-said-kevin-mcguire-was-targeted-by-at-least-two-men","story":"A MURDER inquiry has been launched after a-year-old man was stabbed repeatedly outside a house in a targeted attack."},{"url":null,"title":"riverford-gardens-first-release-of-homes-in-glasgow-private-housing-development-launches","story":"THE first release of properties in one of the cityrsquos largest private housing developments has been launched."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-credit-help-to-get-online-to-make-a-claim","story":"WITH smart phones, tablets and personal computers becoming a dominant feature in everyday le, you could be forgiven for thinking everyone is using the latest technology."},{"url":null,"title":"this-years-moiras-run-to-be-filmed-for-new-documentary","story":"RUNNERS honouring murdered Moira Jones will this year be filmed crossing the finishing line for a new documentary at the tenth anniversary of her death."},{"url":null,"title":"england-under-21s-claim-convincing-victory-over-scotland-under-21s-side","story":"England concluded their European Under- Championship qualication campaign unbeaten with a convincing - win over their Scotland counterparts at Tynecastle."},{"url":null,"title":"libby-mcarthur-i-think-queue-skipping-is-the-thin-edge-of-the-wedge-and-have-been-known-to-grab-folk","story":"Forty years ago my sister married a ldquoMalteser so having a wee, out of season, family visit, am writing to you now from Malta.

that was controversially ripped up to make way for a sporting event more than a year ago will be reinstated.The island between Don Street and Cheyne Road was removed to accommodate runners on the Great Aberdeen Run but the decision sparked an outcry among residents.They said the trees acted as a barrier to driving between the streets and demanded they be reinstated after cars were spotted driving over the island.Aberdeen City Council previously said the trees would not be brought back as it was “not practical to reinstate a permanent solution” at this time.However, Vycki Ritson, team leader of traffic management and road safety at Aberdeen City Council, visited the Old Aberdeen Community Council and revealed there had been a change of heart following a plea from Councillor Alex McLellan.Two large trees and several smaller ones were cut down in August last year, leaving only soil and a black and white barrier in their place.At the time residents called for the council to be held accountable for the “unacceptable” loss which happened in a conservation area.Following the controversy the council has installed bollards and planters in a bid to cut the number of motorists driving over the top.The community council said it would prefer to see trees replanted.At the meeting, suggestions were made for what could be put back on the site, including indigenous trees.However, it would still be necessary to ensure that a clear passageway is maintained for runners.Councillor McLellan, who represents the Old Aberdeen area, said: “I’m incredibly pleased that a course of action is now being progressed following my motion.“This will see a reinstatement which will still incorporate the great Aberdeen Run route.“Officers will work with the community to ensure the reinstatement is in-keeping with the Old Aberdeen conservation area and within the agreed budget.”A city council spokeswoman said: “Following a report to operational delivery committee in September it was agreed the island would be reinstated in consultation with the Great Run’s management group and the local community.“These proposed changes are currently being worked on and, once completed, they will be presented to Old Aberdeen Community Council for comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/Table-781x564.jpg ","title":"dozens of drivers flouting vehicle

caught the offences between August , the day they were switched on, and September .That equates to an average of  offences a day.Aberdeen City Council said it has sent out the tickets to the

He won the Champions League and also claimed three Premier League titles, three FA Cups and four League Cups.So any advice or feedback from the -cap winning star is like gold dust – and will benefit the Reds.Lowe said: “It is frightening because with being , I am used to watching the gaffer in World Cups.“When he first came in I was a bit starstruck. But you have to listen to anything he says because he has been there and done it at World Cups and Champions League finals.“If he says something, I really pick up on it because I want to learn from him.”Aberdeen secured Lowe on a loan deal until January  from the Championship Rams the day before the summer transfer window closed.The -year-old had started the first two Championship games of the season for Derby only to fall down to third-choice left-back.However, such was Lampard’s faith in the defender, he signed him on a three-year contract extension  hours before he moved north to Pittodrie.Lowe remains in regular contact with Lampard and assistant Jody Morris, who also played for Cha.The Reds defender said: “The gaffer has been great with me since he came in during pre-season.“He has shown me the things I can do to improve and Jody is always on the phone to me as well.“I will text him after the game to let him know how I did and also to see how Derby did.“They get clips sent to them and Jody will tell me what I should and shouldn’t do defensively.“I take it all on board as they have both played at a high level and Jody has played in the Scottish league himself. There are no better people to work under.“Hopefully, Derby can do well this season as well as Aberdeen.”Lowe produced a superb performance in the - defeat of St Mirren at Pittodrie before the recent international break.He pitched in with his first goal for the Dons and also provided an assist for Sam Cosgrove to net his second of the game.Lowe said: “I love to get forward but I am a defender at the end of the day and that is my job.“However, at any opportunity I try to put some crosses into the box and get some goals.”Prior to the St Mirren game, manager McInnes had challenged Lowe to defend like a full-back and attack like a winger. Lowe delivered and was pivotal in that victory.McInnes said: “Max was positive, he was assertive, imposed himself on the wide player he was against and the pace he’s got is clear.“It was a lovely finish for his goal although I don’t know how he ended up on the penalty spot.“However, Max got there and it was a lovely, calm finish.”McInnes insists Lowe was secured to free up skipper and Scotland international Graeme Shinnie to operate in midfield.Lowe now faces a battle with Andy Considine to secure that left-back slot against league leaders Hearts.McInnes said: “We are enjoying working with Max and he is a youngster in the team who will get even better. He’ll have a good career and we’re grateful to have him.“Especially when at times we know the importance of Shinnie in the middle of the park.“Andyhas been a very strong left-back for me over the last few years.“There will be times when Andy is the better option to play there but against St Mirren, Max was the right one to play left-back.”Lowe recently indicated he would be happy to extend his loan spell beyond January until the end of the season.For McInnes that would have been the ideal scenario but admits it is too early into the loan spell to commit to that.When askedLowe’s loan could be extended, McInnes said: “The answer is I don’t know. We would have been happy to do a season-long loan but Derby are in charge of that, as it is with all loans.“The time to really look at that would be further down the line and seeing where Derby are, where Max is and where we are with regards the whole situation.“Butthis was December  and there was a decision to make, hopefully staying here would be a good one as he is a good option.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity shirt drive by lynx","story":"Ice hockey fans still have time to get their hands on shirts worn by the Aberdeen Lynx – and donate money to a good cause.The Granite City side are auctioning off their special orange third kit, pictured, worn in home fixtures during this year’s Scottish National LeagueEastern Conference.Proceeds from the auction of the one-off kits, which can be accessed via the Lynx’s facebook page, will go to Charlie House.The north-east- based children’s charity supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions.A club spokesman said: “These shirts are a one-off, never to be produced again, so they are extra special.”Bids will be accepted up until Sunday October  at pm, at which point the winners will be revealed.The Lynx will next play against Kilmarnock Thunder in the Scottish Cup, before closing their Eastern Conference – or Stuart Robertson Cup – campaign with an away fixture against Dundee Tigers on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.There was some suspicion over the intentions of health and social care managers at the recent meeting of Mid Argyll Health and Care Forum .Members felt their recent behaviour might be a precursor to changing the forum set-up to make it saferand more homogenised across the region.But there was also strong feeling the HCF should be better attended by public representatives such as community councillors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities. Alzheimer Scotland wants to make sure that people with dementia and their carers can work with local decision makers, helping to influence important decisions about how vital care and support is delivered in their area.We need your help to ensure people with dementia and carers get the best possible standard of care and support, anywhere in Scotland.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal. Alessandro Varese, owner of the Blue Lagoon chippy, believes a proposed outlet on High Street will open up a number of job opportunities for residents.

Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April . That’s what we are aiming for. “Between the property and the cost of the fit, we are talking about an investment or three-quarters of a million pounds, so it is a big project for us. “This is the furthest north we have been and we are looking at employing around - local people.” The Blue Lagoon already has both takeaways and restaurants in Glasgow, as well as in places like Ayr, Largs and Stirling. The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian.

Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much. They are actually meeting up and having their version of a ceilidh!"},{"url":null,"title":"pass-the-parcel-over-new-railway-station-for-east-linton","story":"A campaign has been ongoing for nearly two decades, with the earliest opening of the station thought to be .However, fears have repeatedly been raised that the timeline could change, with the opening of the station, along with one at Reston in the Scottish Borders, slipping further down the line.Transport Scotland has stressed the plans remain ldquoon schedule and the commitment to the scheme is ldquounwavering.Tom Thorburn, chairman of Rail Action Group East of Scotland , aired his frustrations at RAGESrsquo AGM last month.He said: ldquoWe have been campaigning for these stations to open for nearly  years.ldquoWe have been shunted from one Transport Minister to another with delaying tactics from each so that no firm decision is taken when our new stations will happen.Various discussions have taken place with a succession of Transport Ministers since , when Stewart Stevenson MSP, according to Mr Thorburn, confirmed that a second Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidancewould not be required as the case for the Edinburgh to Berwick local service with a re-opened station at East Linton was so strong.However, since then, progress has been slow, with still no date confirmed for when work could begin on the station.Already, East Lothian Council has agreed to put forward more than pound million for the station, with Scottish Borders Council doing similar for the station at Reston.The new East Linton station would not be on the site of the former station there, which closed in , and instead would be to the west.Mr Thorburn said: ldquoThere is now a sixth Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, and when I tried to make an appointment to see him, his staff said his diary was full.ldquoWe have no way of knowing when our stations will happen ndash will it be by  or will they drop off Network Railrsquos agenda altogether ldquoIt seems that it is a lsquopass the parcelrsquo exercise from one minister to the next and East Linton and Reston stations are not seen as a high priority project by the Scottish Government.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: ldquoIt was agreed by the Scottish Government and East Lothian Council that East Linton station will be delivered during the next railway investment periodas part of a larger programme of works to enhance the East Coast Main Line.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-power-to-use-100-wind-power-after-selling-off-last-coal-and-gas-stations","story":"The Spanish-owned giant has become the first major UK energy supplier to refocus entirely on renewable sources such as wind and solar.Its move comes a week after the International Panel on Climate Changewarned the world was \"off track\" in efforts to limit environmentally catastrophic global warming.IPCC scientists warned \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" were required.Scottish Power on Tuesday said it had sold its remaining conventional electricity generation business to a subsidiary of Drax Group for poundm.And it said it would invest pound.bn in UK to more than double existing  gigawatt capacity for renewable energy over the next four years.Ignacio Galaacuten, Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberdrola, Scottish Powers parent, said: \"Energy companies must be part of the solution to climate change.\"Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions  per cent by  and be carbon neutral by .

These include the design of stealth drones advocated by defence companies such as BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin.The discovery, which confirms the common plant among the natural worldrsquos best fliers, shows movement of air around and within its ldquoparachute-shaped bundle of bristles often enables seeds to travel half a mile or more, kept afloat entirely by windpower.Gardeners generally dislike dandelions as they are viewed as weeds which have huge taproots that break easily when being removed.It can also regenerate from the tiniest piece to four times the size of what gardeners were trying to remove in the first place.The featherweight seeds carry on the lightest breeze and lodge themselves into every crack in the ground and every millimetre of bare soil.:Drone ban for children proposedDandelion pollen is not particularly nutritious, compared with that of clover and vetches, but it is available when little  is about.From March to November it offers a reliable source of food for all species of bees, beetles, butterflies and hoverflies.Now researchers from Edinburgh University have carried out experiments to understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.The findings show the seeds could be used in helping design under-the-radar technology such as drones for spy missions by the security services.The study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles.This enhances the drag that slows each seedrsquos descent to the ground.The newly found form of air bubble, which scientists have named the separated vortex ring, is physically detached from the bristles and stabilised by air flowing through it.Researchers found that the amount of air is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, and is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles.The flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seedsrsquo steady flight and is four times more efficient than a conventional parachute.Scientists say the dandelionrsquos porous parachute may inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power.Such drones could also be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.:New dandelion find on St Kilda#They hope their findings can be used to help engineering and sustainable technology fields.Dr Cathal Cummins, of the universityrsquos Schools of Biological Sciences and Engineering, who led the study, said: ldquoTaking a closer look at the ingenious structures in nature, like the dandelionrsquos parachute, can reveal novel insights.BAE Systems recently unveiled an aircraft design that is viewed as a major advance in stealth technology.The Magma drone does away with aircraft control surfaces, which has resulted in an aircraft whose shape remains constant throughout its flight.The small demonstration aircraft, which has completed a successful first flight, uses blown air to change direction instead of complex mechanical controls.Most aeroplanes look unmoving in flight, like a wing hanging off a giant tube flying through the sky.But conventional aircraft use a system of elevators, rudders and ailerons to control their direction in the pitch and roll directions.:Drone photography poses risk to wildle - expertsThese mechanical devices are usually in the shape of control surfaces attached to the rear of the wing, horizontal and vertical stabilisers and are controlled by the pilot ndash or sometimes an onboard flight computer.Control surfaces have been an instrumental part of aircraft since the early th century. These mechanisms can and do fail, limiting an aeroplanersquos manoeuvrability.But among a new generation of stealth warplanes, control surfaces can also affect an airplanersquos carefully shaped stealth profile, as the fin-like device moves upward or downward, momentarily making the aircraft slightly more visible to radar.Now the Edinburgh University researchers are hopeful that the dandelion seeds can help advance the technology further.The study, published in science journal Nature, was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the Royal Society."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin-offers-to-extend-the-transition-period-may-has-not-ruled-it-out","story":"The countrys deputy prime minister Simon Coveney reacted positively to reports that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was open to pushing the implementation period back a year to end in December .UK Government sources insisted Downing Street was not calling for an extension to transition arrangements which is not an outright rejection.The offer will enrage Brexiteers who will argue it would keep the UK effectively in the single market and customs union for at least another year with British taxpayers continue to pay over billions of pounds to EU coffers.Plus, it would enrage UK fishermen as it would mean the country would not take back control of its waters until December  at the earliest more than five years after the  EU vote.Theresa May is preparing for what is likely to be a fractious Prime Ministers Questions in the Commons before she travels to Brussels for talks with Donald Tusk, the European Council President, and before she addressed EU leaders ahead of an EU dinner.There are growing concerns the two sides will be unable to bridge the gap over the key issue of agreeing a \"backstop\" deal to ensure there will not be ato a hard border in Ireland when the UK quits the EU.Mr Coveney told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"What Michel Barnier is now suggesting is, look, lets ensure that the backstop is never likely to be used by creating the space and time for the UK and the EU to be able to negotiate UK-wide customs arrangements that can ensure that there wont ever be the need for customs checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.\"We have always said that we are happy to show flexibility in terms of how we get to a destination where-by there is a backstop, or an insurance mechanism, in place to reassure people on the island of Ireland that they are not going to see the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure.\"And what Michel Barnier has indicated very clearly is that the EU side, certainly, is willing to allow more time in the transition period to agree an alternative solution to a backstop.\"The EU meeting is the occasion when the leaders of the remaining  member states were supposed to give the green light for a special summit in November to finalise the terms of Britains withdrawal.But Mr Coveney made it clear that summit would not go ahead unless signicant progress is made on the border issue.He said: \"Whats more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there wont be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on.\"Both sides want to get a deal done here, and I think we need... to allow the negotiating teams to set the pace with a view to making recommendations, hopefully by mid-November, that a new summit is necessary to sign off on a final deal.\"Mr Tusk has warned that without new \"concrete proposals\" from the British to break the logjam over the Irish border backstop, further progress on a deal may be impossible.However, with her party split, and some Tory MPs openly calling for her to go, Mrs May has little room to manoeuvreshe is to secure a deal which stands any chance of getting through Parliament.Ahead of her visit to Brussels, Mrs May was able to secure the backing of her Cabinet, at least for now, amid reports that some Brexiteer ministers were prepared to quitshe gave too much ground to Brussels.However, there was anger among Tory Brexiteers after The Dailyreported that Chancellor Philip Hammond warned the meeting that the UK could still have to pay the EU up to pound billion of the pound billion \"orce bill\" to settle its outstanding liabilities, in the event of a no-deal break.The PM is also due to have bilateral meetings with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker,and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-a-smacking-ban-would-truly-make-us-a-civilised-nation","story":"So why would it be any dferent for a child  When parents chastise their children with a smack or a slap, it is far worse than hitting an adult. Grown-ups can defend themselves, or walk away. A partnership or marriage can end, but childhood lasts forever. Unless parental force is so extreme that the authorities have to step in, young children cannot escape their punishers. They simply have to grow wary, and hope it doesnrsquot happen again.Proposals to outlaw smacking, to be brought before Holyrood in a memberrsquos bill by Green MSP John Finnie, might become law within the year. It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight. She and her husband have acquired the sort of negotiating skills that could win us a brilliant Brexit deal.

Not by the cheeky Pink promo idea, but by the fact someone had imagined me wearing a Scotland shirt. And that set the mind into a quandary. I still have pics of me as a seven year-old wearing a Scotland shirt, imagining myself to be a young Baxteror a dark-haired Jinky. I wore this soft cotton classic to bed. I wore it until it demanded it be boil washed in Lux. I wore this shirt until my skinny little frame produced enough content to stretch its seams to breaking point.My Scotland shirt connection didnrsquot end there. In my late teens and early twenties I wore one to Wembley. To Hampden. On holiday. But right now I feel Irsquod rather wear lederhosen and a sparkly boob tube. The idea of pulling on a Scotland jersey simply seems wrong.Why this disconnect  It doesnrsquot apply to all cultural forms. I still think Lulu to be the greatest white soul singer everand love Gerry Rafferty, and Scots comedy and Still Game. Could it be that the football of latehasnrsquot been great  Perhaps. But being destroyed by Israel wasnrsquot a surprise what would have been a surprise was the score line being reversed.Has this rejection of the jersey something to to with the growth of Nationalism  A friend whorsquos not a Nationalist is now talking of voting for independence when Ref  is called, on the basis of feeling aggrieved that Scotland is being Brexited. As it happens, Irsquom with this sentiment. But where we part company is this sense of injustice is not the loudest voice in my head. The voice screaming out is one of worry for the future, for the children who have to grow up in this little indie world which exists without a thought-out economic plan.Could my not pulling on the jersey be down to the fact the SNP wonrsquot reveal a strategy for containing multinational tax dodging, supporting the ailing NHS or determining who will build schools  If I slip on the Scotland jersey am I shedding the warm vest that has been the Barnett Formula Whatrsquos inarguable is we are now a ided, self-centred little nation. In movie imagery terms on the one side are the Brigadooners, , and The Debt Collectors, who believe there is ultimately a price to pay for living on little more than a dream.Meantime, we live in a Scotland in which we are constantly being dabbed with the calamine lotion of liberal policy. Last week, Scotland ldquodeclared war on hate crimes, a statement so nebulous yoursquod need an astro telescope to work out any form of fine line detail. So much of our governmentrsquos policy is displacement activity. And much of it, as my colleague Iain MacWhirter pointed out this week, not well thought out, such as the anti-sectarian bill.The fear of the shirt may also be the fear of the economic cliques the country has encouraged and will continue to grow.Itrsquos a worry, for example, over Creative Scotland, reflected in the hapless judgements of last year, or Scottish Enterprise and a claimed poundm lost in failed businesses in the past decade.But perhaps the fear of the new Adidas jumper reflects a changing national identity.Wersquove kept our dark, cheeky aggression, but lost our sense of community, our support systems, our ldquotake your turn of the stairs mentality.There are deeper thoughts emerging about being part of Team Scotland. Therersquos the worry London mayor Sadiq Khan may be right when he connects nationalism with racism. Therersquos a concern that when hermetic Nationalists valorise Scotland and demand separation from England it implies that England is somehow less. If we care about social justice and egalitarianism why does it need to stop at Carlisle This somehow sits at odds with the times of those early Scotland strips being worn when the essence of being Scottish was summed up by someone such as Jimmy Reid. Perhaps the Scotland jersey was headed for the recycle bank bin when Tommy Sheridan ended up on Big Brother and Alex Salmond on Russia Today.Perhaps the Brigadoon mist cleared with new understandings of what Scotland is about. Itrsquos a knowing of the part we played in the slave trade, that Robert Louis Stevenson created the world view of shortbread tin Scotland, and that in fact he wrote of darker duality of his home nation in the likes of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped, that Scotland has long been at war with itself, reflected in aspiration and sometimes sheer greed.Perhaps thatrsquos why I canrsquot see me pulling on that Scotland jersey anytime soon.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she is delighted to see it being implemented so swtly.She said: \"By encouraging people to top up from the tap using refillable bottles, we will help cut down on our use of plastics and promote the benefits of hydration building on Scottish Waters Your Water, Your Le campaign.\"I now look forward to refilling my bottle at the Top Up Tap outside the parliament in the coming months.\"The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers.Water samples will be tested every two minutes, on average, to ensure that quality is maintained.Licensed premises are legally bound to serve tap water on request, yet research shows Scots are uncomfortable asking, something this campaign hopes to change. Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleThursday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amThis week#s edition is now available in shops and online, here.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption. She said bus replacement services would have less of an impact than the road closures.She said: \"Itrsquos been well documented that the current convoy system is having a hugely detrimental impact on pupils attending Plockton High School as well as local businesses.\"The situation is far from ideal. I believe a better solution is that ScotRail and Network Rail should terminate all trains at Strathcarron and for a bus replacement service to operate and call at all stations between Strathcarron and Kyle.

Notwithstanding that using the same logic about avoiding a hard border in Ireland would simply sht that hard border to between Scotland and England, the denial of such a deal would then be used by the SNP as a grievance to inflate demands for a second independence referendum. With passions running high about any dferent treatment of the component nations of the United Kingdom, the SNP would nurse their latest grievance to try and swing doubters their way in favour of independence. : Ruth Davidson and David Mundell in quit threat over BrexitMundell and Davidson recognise the strategic and tactical dangers in such an argument and have, rightly, called on the Prime Minister to not throw the SNP such an unintended advantage.Johnson, writing in his weekly newspaper column, also spotted the problem and rightly condemned the  choice between the EU iding our country or dictating our trade laws without us having a say.Borders are borders. Whether or not the border is a line on the ground or in the sea, there will be a place where the jurisdiction changes. That’s all it is, a change in the laws and who has the authority to enforce them. This normally takes place by someone stopping those in transit and seeking clarication that the people or goods comply with the dferent laws. The perception is that this always takes place when the border is crossed, but that’s not how it happens any more – technology has changed all that.Now people are often checked before they depart rather than when they arrive. Most people that take a flight have to prove who they are and show that they have the authority to enter the place of destinationat the flight gate before setting off. Nobody kicks up a fuss about this.The same goes for the transit of goods. When Guinness leaves Dublin to go to Belfast, Glasgow or Liverpool, the necessary paperwork is completed electronically taking account of the dfering duties, taxes and regulations so that it complies and any dues are paid to the correct authority. : Brexit: Labour members back second EU referendumThe beer truck is not stopped at the border. Only random checks are necessary and these are conducted anywhere on the journey by officials from any of the jurisdictions involved. There is no fuss made about this either.The idea that there will be a need for border checkpoints holding up traffic, asking for bills of lading is a mendacious invention by the EU to keep us in its Single Market and Customs Union – or ide our country. A physical border is not needed unless there is an occasional emergency such as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Those arguing that there cannot be a trade deal without hard borders are the same people that want to keep us in the EU.

And they, he added, are “simply unwilling to have more turbines foisted upon them”.So they will doubtless be dismayed by the news that Scottish Power has sold off its gas and hydro plants to concentrate on wind and renewables, with plans to more than double the capacity of windfarms currently generating electricity or under construction. However, for others, it is a sign of things to come, a move that heralds a new age as the world moves towards a zero-carbon future that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change and bring a literal breath of fresh air to blow away potentially deadly pollution.These two groups may seem implacably opposed to one another, but in reality they both make valid points. Scotland is famous all over the world for the romantic beauty of its landscape, a fact that helps encourage millions of tourists to come here. Allowing the industrialisation of the Highlands would be a scandal. But, fortunately, that does not need to happen. Scotland has vast amounts of wind energy and it is possible to site onshore windfarms in places where they do not desecrate the countryside. : Scottish Power becomes first big UK energy firm to switch to % wind powerAnd the most consistent supply of wind is found out to sea, particularly on the west coast, as anyone who has visited the Outer Hebrides can attest. The UK Government has been criticised for failing to encourage onshore windfarms – not least because they are a source of increasingly cheap electricity. However, part of Westminster’s strategy has been to encourage offshore wind in the hope that the UK – and particularly Scotland – can create a globally signicant industry. As UK Energy Minister Claire Perry pointed out in The Scotsman yesterday, the transition to renewable energy is a challenge but also “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time”. So Scotland can help the world fight climate change and make money in the process.And it is the latter reason that is perhaps the most important driving force, as Scottish Power’s chief executive Keith Anderson suggested when he said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.” The firm has become the first of the ‘Big Six’ to ditch fossil fuels but simple economics means it is unlikely to be the last,: UK Energy Minister: Scotland has a chance of a letime on green energy©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie

open to extra year under eu rules as she seeks creative exit","story":"Theresa May has told EU leaders she is ready to keep the UK under single market and customs union rules for an extra year after Brexit in the absence of any solutions to the impasse over the Irish border.At the start of a summit that had previously been earmarked as the deadline for a breakthrough, both sides admitted the deadlock would take more time to untangle and said they were willing to extend the post-Brexit transition until the end of .The admission will anger Brexiteers in the Conservative Party and pose a

beyond .The Prime Minister addressed EU leaders for  minutes in Brussels last night, setting out the UK’s position on Brexit talks before leaving the summit while they discussed her comments over dinner.“We have shown we can do dficult deals constructively,” Mrs May told the EU leaders. “I remain confident of a good outcome.”: Six-year-old boy wins right to sue Orkney-based ing company after death of fatherShe added: “The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.”A UK source said the Prime Minister issued an appeal “to find a creative way out of this dilemma” on the Irish border and reiterated she was “fully committed to finding a legally operative backstop” that guarantees no hard border in Ireland.However, despite a call from European Council president Donald Tusk for “new facts” on the Irish border, there was little evidence of fresh proposals to break the stalemate.Speaking after hearing Mrs May’s address to EU leaders, European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said: “There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn’t perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs May.”Mr Tajani added the Prime Minister had said she was willing to consider a proposal from the EU to extend the transition period.An EU source confirmed Mrs May was ready to consider adding an extra year.Arriving at the summit, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had told reporters that “much more time” was needed to reach a breakthrough.“We are not there yet ... we will continue the work in the next weeks calmly and patiently,” he said.EU leaders must now decide whether to hold an emergency summit next month, despite warnings from leaders including French president Emmanuel Macron that no further meeting could take place without progress on the Irish border.A November summit could be used to focus on preparations for a no-deal Brexit.A final Brexit deal could now be put off until as late as December – beyond the point at which Mr Barnier had said an agreement was essential.The French Government yesterday published draft no-deal legislation that could require British citizens to obtain a visa before travelling to France following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.EU leaders voiced frustration at Mrs May’s inability to command the full support of her party.Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite claimed the Prime Minister didn’t have a “strong mandate”.Ms Grybauskaite said it was dficult for the EU to “negotiate with a person who has no full support of the position”.And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said last night: “We are concerned because we see it is dficult in the British Parliament to have the same views on the future of the relationship between the EU and UK.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie

for Video...Vulnerable people across the country are being driven to starvation as a result of Universal Credit according to an SNP minister. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville called for the UK Government to halt proceedings and address some of the major problems following the rollout of Universal Credit.Speaking at Glasgow City Council’s Universal Credit hub in Ibrox, she told the Daily Record: “As a constituency MSP and on ministerial visits, I have heard of cases that are simply heartbreaking. “I have had case studies put to me of people who only eat on a Tuesday and a Thursday because they have no money coming into the house.“When I visited the Citizens Advice Bureau, I saw that they put ‘starvation’ in the case study notes for someone.“In this day and age in Scotland, we are talking about that because of a choice that’s being made by this Westminster Government on how to run a benefits system.”She also stated that many councils were trying their best to combat the problem and praise Glasgow City Council for their hub saying: “The council and Scottish Government can’t stop these roll-outs from happening. But what they are able to provide is inidualised support for people to access a system that is inherently designed to make it as complicated as possible and to create as many barriers as possible.“Services like these can break down these barriers.“It’s great the council are doing that for them but it’s a shame it’s required in the first place.”New claimants at the Govan jobcentre were the first in Glasgow to switch to Universal Credit on September  – with more than , others in the city set to follow between now and early December.Following the roll-outs in other parts of the UK, many have suffered with food bank use and rent arrears rising.Labour is to attempt to force the Government to publish its analysis of the impact of Universal Credit on people’s incomes.The party will use an opposition day debate in the Commons on Wednesday to try to secure the release of the assessment drawn up by officials.Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said they would use the same procedural device they adopted last year to obtain the release of the Government’s Brexit impact assessment papers.Yesterday, the Church of England joined calls for reform of Universal Credit, saying fallout from the new benefit system is being seen at its food banks across the country.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

Mr Casey was raised in Derry and attended Nazareth House Primary School and St Columbs College. He is the CEO and Chairman hf global recruitment firm Claddagh Resources. History was made last year when the Dáil gave formal recognition to Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within the State.However, Mr Casey said: \"Thats a load of nonsense. They are not from Romany or whatever.\"When challenged about his views, Mr Casey doubled down, saying the arrival of Travellers in an area \"devastates the prices of the houses\".\"Lets call a spade a spade. Your house price doesnt start going through the roof as soon as you get two dozen Travellers moving in down the street from you,\" he said.He cited an ongoing dispute in Tipperary where six homes are empty in a €.m development because families living on an unauthorised site nearby want stables for horses.\"Im sorry, theres something seriously wrong with society when were at that stage,\" Mr Casey said.His comments were last night described by Pavee Point as \"ill-informed, grossly insulting and offensive\".David Joyce, a member of the Travelling community and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, told the Irish Independent: \"He should withdraw from the campaign. Hes shown hes not fit to represent all the people of Ireland. This man is a racist. He is scapegoating my community.\"Mr Joyce, who is also a solicitor, added: \"I dont think any presidential campaign in the past has ever stooped to this level of blatant racism.\"He said the candidates views were \"founded on ignorance, prejudice and pure racism\".\"The notion that we all live in caravans and pull up on peoples land is rubbish,\" he said.Martin Collins, co-director of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, said: \"These comments put his presidential campaign on the same level as a local election where people play the nimby card to gain votes, as we have seen so often in the past.Martin Collins, co-director of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, has criticised the comments. \"This potentially can feed into racist stereotypes and it is reckless and irresponsible and certainly not befitting anyone standing to be president for all the people of Ireland.\"Mr Collins said Mr Caseys input had helped to \"belittle the lived experience of Travellers in terms of racism and exclusion\".The interview was described as \"very concerning\" by Shane OCurry, director of the European Network Against Racism, which has  member organisations in Ireland.\"I am shocked at the ignorance of his comments. They show that Peter Casey is as ignorant as he is inept at politicking,\" he said.\"His comments about Traveller ethnicity fly in the face of academic consensus and what Travellers say themselves.\"It betrays a gross misunderstanding of what it is to be an ethnic minority, as well as a gross misunderstanding of what le is like in Ireland for ethnic minorities.\"The purpose of recognising Traveller ethnicity is to renegotiate the relationship between society and Travellers so that we can value Travellers contribution to society more.\"Peter Caseys comments have a devastating effect.

Last night he said they should \"think and act as Irish people\".He has also stood over remarks made on Independent.ies Floating Voter podcast that Travellers are \"basically people camping in someone s land\". Reacting to Mr Caseys latest comments, the co-director of the Traveller advocacy group Pavee Point, Martin Collins, said the millionaires latest contribution has \"compounded the situation\". \"He has added insult to injury,\" Mr Collins said.A number of councillors who helped Mr Casey get on the ballot paper have said they do not regret giving him their vote, although most said they disagree with his comments.Despite the controversy, Mr Casey plans to travel to Cabra Bridge in Thurles to see a €.m development that has been built for Travellers who are currently living on an unauthorised site nearby.It has been reported the families want access to two stables and at least half-an-acre of land each for their horses.Mr Casey has been critical of the role played by Pavee Point in the dispute, saying they should tell the Travellers about people \"sleeping on the streets of Dublin\".Mr Casey was asked by presenter Pat Kenny about his controversial comments yesterday on the first televised Irish Presidential debate with all six candidates.\"We have so many wonderful nationalities here, its wrong to single out one particular ethnic group dferently,\" he said.\"One of the county councils who endorsed me was Tipperary, and as you know we have a housing crisis at the moment.\"When I was down there, there was €.m spent building six houses that the Travelling community wouldnt move into because they wanted sheds and two stables and one acre of land.\"Why should they be given the right to turn down a house  I think that is wrong.\"Current President Michael D Higgins has highlighted that Traveller men have  years less le expectancy than other males, and are six times more likely to commit suicide.Kenny asked candidatesthey would like Traveller people to live next door to them.Mr Higgins said: \"Yes, I have a halting site a couple of hundred yards from my house and they are wonderful people.\"And speaking earlier on RTEs Six One News he defended his position, saying: \"Theres far too much political correctness in society... I say what I think and I think what I say.\"He has received a considerable level of support on social media. However, Mr Collins said that Pavee Point has represented the Travelling community well and the candidates view of the situation in Tipperary is \"misinformed\".

After her Chequers plan for Brexit was humiliatingly rejected at the last EU summit in Salzburg last month and efforts to seal a last-minute deal foundered last weekend over the EUs demand for a \"backstop\" to avoid a hard border in Ireland, Mrs May was fighting to keep the door open for an agreement to deliver an orderly withdrawal.Addressing leaders of the  remaining EU member states in Brussels, she stressed that signicant progress had been made in many areas of the negotiations and urged them to find a \"creative\" way out of the current dilemma. \"We have shown we can do dficult deals together constructively,\" she said.\"I remain confident of a good outcome.\" The Prime Minister added: \"The last stage will need courage, trust and leadership on both sides.\" Following her -minute speech, Mrs May left to eat at the UK ambassadors residence in the Belgian capital, leaving the EU leaders to discuss Brexit in her absence over dinner.The president of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, said: \"Both sides mentioned the idea of an extension of the transition period as one possibility which is on the table and would have to be looked into.\" A senior EU official later said Mrs May had indicated she was \"ready to consider\" a longer transition period.Mrs May initially suggested an \"implementation period\" of around two years after Brexit to give the UKs authorities and companies time to prepare for the new arrangements. But she later accepted a -month transition offered by the EU, ending on the last day of December .It emerged yesterday that Mr Barnier was ready to discuss a further years extension to allow time to find a solution to keep the Irish border open.UK officials stressed that the Prime Minister was not proposing any extension to the period already agreed.Any further extension is likely to be fiercely opposed by Eurosceptics, who warn the UK would become a \"vassal state\" of Brussels, bound by its rules but unable to influence them.And it is certain to involve a demand from Brussels for a further years contributions towards EU budgets, which could cost the UK as much as £ billion.This weeks European summit has long been billed as \"the moment of truth\" when agreement was needed to allow time for ratication before Brexit day in March.But Mr Barnier made clear no breakthrough was now expected, saying that \"much more time\" was needed to bridge dferences between the two sides, and promising to \"continue the work in the next weeks calmly and patiently\". Mrs May did not come forward with the new \"concrete proposals\" on the border issue which European Council president Donald Tusk has said are needed to break the deadlock. A number of EU leaders voiced their willingness to work for an orderly UK withdrawal. But several also noted that their countries were beginning preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.In a speech to the German parliament before travelling to Brussels, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the possibility of a Brexit deal was \"still there\", but added that Berlin was making plans for a no-deal withdrawal. In Paris, Emmanuel Macrons government published details of legislation to authorise preparations for a no-deal Brexit, which could see the restoration of customs checks and health inspections for animals at French ports, and even a requirement for Britons to seek visas for stays of three months or more.Mr Macron, who held separate talks with Mrs May ahead of the three-hour dinner, said it was time to \"accelerate\" talks. But Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite said there would be \"no breakthrough\" this week because Mrs May lacked a strong mandate from her party and parliament.Britain needed \"to decide finally what they want and to rally behind the Prime Minister all together, not split\", she said, adding: \"Today we do not know what they want.\"They do not know themselves what they want. \"It is a problem.\""},{"url":null,"title":"trust your unionist instincts arlene foster tells prime minister ahead of brexit summit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has denied any involvement.In a note affixed to the top of the column, Post Global Opinions editor Karen Attiah said she received the essay from Mr Khashoggi’s translator and assistant a day after he was reported missing.

Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence,” he wrote.“As a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate,” Khashoggi wrote.US president Donald Trump, who initially came out hard on the Saudis over the disappearance but since has backed off, said on Wednesday that the US wanted Turkey to turn over any audio or video recording it had of Mr Khashoggi’s alleged killing “ it exists”.He has recently suggested that the global community had jumped to conclusions that Saudi Arabia was behind Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance.In the column, Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen who went into self-imposed exile in the US over the rise of the crown prince, also discussed the practice of Middle Eastern governments blocking internet access to control tightly the information their citizens can see.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Turkish forensic officers have been at the Saudi consulate to conduct a new search “The Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power,” Mr Khashoggi wrote.He praised the Post for translating many of his columns from English into Arabic and said it was important for Middle Easterners to be able to read about democracy in the West. He also said it was critical that Arab voices have a  on which to be heard.“We suffer from poverty, mismanagement and poor education,” Mr Khashoggi wrote. “Through the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.”The Post initially held off on publishing the column amid hope for Mr Khashoggi’s , Ms Attiah said. But, she wrote, “Now I have to accept: That is not going to happen.”She ended her note: “This column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Across the land, the sight of heads bowed over small screens is now ubiquitous.“But what our research shows is just how attached to our mobile phones we really are – and perhaps without even realising it.”The research also indicated that two-thirds of mobile phone userscheck their phones while in bed despite sleep issues having been linked to the blue light emitted by phone screens and other devices.Some hardware manufacturers have introduced night light features to lower the amount of blue light emitted by devices in an effort to reduce the impact of late night usage.“We can only speculate on the impact this is having in terms of our relationships with colleagues, friends and even close family – but our survey does suggest that traditional conversations are being discarded, in favour of checking our latest email, notication or message,” Mr Feldman said.Killers ‘not protected’ after RUC ice cream man murder: Police ombudsman Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence, he wrote.ldquoAs a result, Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate, Khashoggi wrote.US president Donald Trump, who initially came out hard on the Saudis over the disappearance but since has backed off, said on Wednesday that the US wanted Turkey to turn over any audio or video recording it had of Mr Khashoggirsquos alleged killing ldquo it exists.He has recently suggested that the global community had jumped to conclusions that Saudi Arabia was behind Mr Khashoggirsquos disappearance.In the column, Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen who went into self-imposed exile in the US over the rise of the crown prince, also discussed the practice of Middle Eastern governments blocking internet access to control tightly the information their citizens can see.Turkish forensic officers have been at the Saudi consulate to conduct a new search ldquoThe Arab world is facing its own version of an Iron Curtain, imposed not by external actors but through domestic forces vying for power, Mr Khashoggi wrote.He praised the Post for translating many of his columns from English into Arabic and said it was important for Middle Easterners to be able to read about democracy in the West.He also said it was critical that Arab voices have a  on which to be heard.ldquoWe suffer from poverty, mismanagement and poor education, Mr Khashoggi wrote.ldquoThrough the creation of an independent international forum, isolated from the influence of nationalist governments spreading hate through propaganda, ordinary people in the Arab world would be able to address the structural problems their societies face.The Post initially held off on publishing the column amid hope for Mr Khashoggirsquos , Ms Attiah said. But, she wrote, ldquoNow I have to accept: That is not going to happen.She ended her note: ldquoThis column perfectly captures his commitment and passion for freedom in the Arab world.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that.

Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
