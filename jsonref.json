It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghans child free spirited writes OSCAR CAINER","story":"    Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex arrives with Prince Harry, at the Hive, Wirral Youth Zone, as part of a visit to Birkenhead near LiverpoolMeghan\u0027s bodyguard to quit after just six months in the job...Armed and in killer heels, Meghan\u0027s bodyguard: How the Duke...Share this article  I\u0027m having an April baby!

He was not hurt, but she realized that she wanted to do something, and she plunged herself into photography. She ended up on film sets taking photos of Hollywood legends. Above, Marlon Brando, left, lights the cigarette of director Bernardo Bertolucci, right, on the set for his film \u0027Last Tango In Paris,\u0027 which was released in 1973 but remains controversial today          After realizing she wanted to be a photographer, Sereny learned all she could about the craft. A good friend was the head of the Italian Olympic Committee and asked her to take photos at the youth centers they were developing. Sereny wanted to know if the photos she had taken were any good, and so she hopped on a plane and went to The Times office in London. She met an editor who eventually put her photos into the newspaper. Above, actress Raquel Welch wears a royal blue, one-piece bathing suit in an image Sereny took in the 1980s          Getting her photos in The Times was the first step in Sereny\u0027s career and she would eventually take shots on film sets. Sigourney Weaver, pictured, had just wrapped the first \u0027Alien,\u0027 which was released in 1979. The actress and Sereny both happened to be in Paris, and she was asked to photograph Weaver. Sereny told DailyMail.com that she wanted the shoot to somewhat have a feel of the movie, and it took place at the architecturally-interesting Centre Pompidou, a museum in Paris           \u0027The Last Picture Show,\u0027 released in 1971, had put director Peter Bogdanovich \u0027on the map,\u0027 Eva Sereny wrote in her recent book, \u0027Through Her Lens: The Stories Behind the Photography of Eva Sereny.\u0027 \u0027I could tell he was completely besotted by actress Cybill Shepherd, whom I liked very much. She was very easy to work with and took beautiful pictures.\u0027 Sereny took the above image of Bogdanovich, left, and Shepherd, right, on the set of \u0027At Long Last Love,\u0027 which was released in 1975          Above, an image of director Sydney Pollack, left, and Robert Redford, right, on the set of the film \u0027The Electric Horseman,\u0027 which was released in late 1979. Sereny told DailyMail.com that she worked with four cameras - two that were for color and two that were black and white. ‘I always wanted to be quick,’ she explained. Images like the one above were ‘quite difficult to do because I had no idea how it would come out. Don’t forget, I’m using film – the real McCoy… You hope to God that it’s going to come out right,’ she said          By the 1980s, Sereny had taken photos on several film sets. Producer Frank Marshall  joined Steven Spielberg’s team for ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ – the first film of the blockbuster Indiana Jones movies – and asked her to be the special photographer on set. Above, from left, Kate Capshaw, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford take a break during the filming of \u0027Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u0027 which was released in 1984          Photographer Eva Sereny, left, with director Steven Spielberg, right. Sereny took photos on three of the Indiana Jones movies - traveling to Tunisia, Sri Lanka and Marbella in Spain. ‘Of course, working on a Spielberg movie is something very special. Just seeing Steven direct is fascinating,’ she wroteWhile shooting on film sets, she tried to be as unobtrusive as possible – and did not take photos during filming.‘I always put myself very much in the back. I didn’t want to be seen. I wanted to be camouflaged,’ she explained.Even so, there were snafus.When she started taking photos on the set of director Herbert Ross’ ‘The Last of Sheila,’ released in 1973, Raquel Welch, she recalled, ‘shouted at me, “Who the hell are you?”’Ross, the director, come to Sereny’s side and let Welch know that she was alright to be on set.‘I don’t want her here. I don’t want her here,’ Welch said.Sereny said she then ‘disappeared. So that was my first encounter with Raquel.’However, she was slated to work with actress again.‘I was very worried that she would remember me. But she didn’t remember me and I never told her,’ she said and then laughed.Sereny said that they are now great work friends, and she has taken many images of Welch. In one photo that is part of her book, the actress wears a royal blue, one-piece bathing suit. While taking snaps on ‘The Last of Sheila,’ Sereny was also the special photographer for Francois Truffaut’s film, ‘Day for Night,’ which was released in 1973, and that was when she meet her good friend Jacqueline Bisset.‘We connected immediately from the beginning and have been very good friends ever since that movie,’ she wrote in her book.Bisset wrote the foreword for Sereny’s book, saying that her ‘photographs capture the deeper soul.’Truffaut, director of the seminal films ‘The 400 Blows’ and ‘Jules and Jim,’ ‘was always very busy on set, one minute he’d be in a conversation, the next second he was somewhere else. I felt even the little time I was on the set with him he was very understanding and pleasant in his commanding position as a director vis-à-vis his actors and crew,’ Sereny wrote.From dazzling cover girl to playful off-duty star: Rare...\u0027I\u0027m looking forward to revisiting the character\u0027: Harrison...Last Tango in Paris rape scene WAS non-consensual: Director...Share this articleSereny also worked on some of Bernardo Bertolucci’s films, including ‘The Conformist,’ ‘1900,’ ‘Last Tango in Paris,’ and ‘Luna.’‘I have to admit that working with Bernardo has definitely inspired my photography,’ she wrote.For ‘Last Tango in Paris,’ star Marlon Brando initially didn\u0027t want her to take his picture but she managed to convince him. As relayed in her book, she told Brando that he would be shown the photos for his approval.But before she could run the images by Brando, French magazine Paris Match wanted the photos right away.‘All he said was “Don’t worry, Eva: you make the choice.” I was able to gain Brando’s trust in me and my work,’ she wrote. ‘What a great feeling!’ In the book, there is an image of Brando lighting Bertolucci’s cigarette on the set of the film, which remains controversial to this day, and another portrait of the actor fixing his red tie.          Francois Truffaut, left, directed many seminal films, including ‘The 400 Blows’ and ‘Jules and Jim.’ He ‘was always very busy on set, one minute he’d be in a conversation, the next second he was somewhere else,’ Sereny wrote in her book \u0027Through Her Lens.\u0027 Sereny took the above photo during \u0027Day for Night,\u0027 which was released in 1973, and starred Jacqueline Bisset. Bisset and Sereny \u0027connected immediately\u0027 and became friends, she wrote in her book. Bisset penned the foreword for Sereny\u0027s book, writing her ‘photographs capture the deeper soul’          Sereny took the image of Werner Herzog, above, off the film set. ‘He was the most interesting director,’ she wrote of Herzog, adding that he was also charming. She photographed Herzog and his cast during  the filming of \u0027Nosferatu the Vampyre,\u0027 which was shot in the Netherlands. His ‘inspired 1979 remake’ starred Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani, Sereny wrote          Director Steven Spielberg on the set of his movie \u0027Always,\u0027 which starred Audrey Hepburn in what turned out to be her last film. \u0027Always\u0027 was in theaters in late 1989, and Hepburn died on January 20, 1993. Sereny told DailyMail.com that Hepburn was  ‘absolutely extraordinary. She was just gorgeous, just gorgeous. It just makes me tearful really to think that’s she gone.\u0027 Sereny had taken photos on three of Spielberg\u0027s Indiana Jones movies          Director Luchino Visconti, pictured, on set of his  film \u0027Death in Venice,\u0027 which was released in 1971. Sereny took the above photo, and the \u0027Death in Venice\u0027 filming was the second time she had taken snaps on a set. The photos she took of one the film\u0027s stars, Italian actress Silvana Mangano, in costume were featured in The Sunday Times Magazine. ‘That’s how everything started for me. It was enormous,’ Sereny recalled          Sereny took this photo of Peter Bogdanovich during the filming of \u0027At Long Last Love,\u0027 a movie that starred Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds and was in theaters in 1975. After Sereny\u0027s husband was in a car accident in the late 1960s, she knew that she wanted to pursue a creative outlet and chose photography. This photo and others are part of her book, \u0027Through Her Lens\u0027          The first movie set that Eva Sereny was on to take photos was director Mike Nichols\u0027 film \u0027Catch-22,\u0027 released in 1970. Throughout his prolific career, Nichols, pictured above on the \u0027Catch- 22\u0027 set, directed such classics as \u0027The Graduate.\u0027 In her book, Sereny recalled how nervous she was to show Nichols her photos: \u0027I studied his face and didn’t notice a change of expression until, slowly, a broad smile surfaced. All was well. I was asked to stay on for the last two weeks of shooting as a paid special photographer \u0027          In one of the most famous scenes of \u0027Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\u0027 star Harrison Ford, playing Jones, cuts the above bridge when he finds himself in a pickle. Sereny took snaps on three of the Indiana Jones films, including this one above with Steven Spielberg, left, and George Lucas, right One of Sereny’s first \u0027photo shoots\u0027 was much less glamorous than Paris: she had to take a shot of her husband’s car after an accident.At around aged 20, Sereny decided to leave London and went to Italy. ‘I was going to stay there for a few months but I stayed there for 50 years,’ she said and then laughed.She married an Italian man, who was an engineer, her first year in Rome and they had two children.One day in 1967, he was on his way to work when his car skidded and went through the side of a bridge.‘I don’t think he even had a scratch – I don’t know how that happened. He had nine lives, thank God,’ she recalled.But he wanted a photo of the car, and Sereny said: ‘Maybe that inspired me.’When the accident happened, Sereny knew that she wanted to do something – she just didn’t know what.‘I knew I was creative but I couldn’t draw. This is God’s truth, I mean, that’s really (what) I was thinking. Maybe photography – I mean literally like that. But I didn’t even think it would become a metier, I mean a profession,’ she recalled. Sereny plunged into photography, getting books and becoming obsessed with developing and printing. ‘I was really, really raw. I didn’t know anything.’ Her first break came from an unlikely source: the Italian Olympic Committee. A good friend was the head of the committee and asked her to take photos at the youth centers they were developing.Sereny wanted to know if the photos she had taken were any good, and so she hopped on a plane and went to London.‘I literally just walked into the foyer of The Times.’At The Times, she met editor Norman Hall, who would take a few days but eventually printed her photos – framing it as future Italian hopefuls for the next Olympics - in the newspaper.Now Sereny had published photos she could show. Her next break was to be hired as a special photographer for director Mike Nichols\u0027 1970 film ‘Catch-22.’ In her book, she explained that a special photographer was ‘someone who just comes to the set and sends their work out via their agency – I was with Camera Press at the time – or directly to newspapers and magazines.’‘The way I like to approach my job is to catch images of the off-moments, when the cameras are not rolling, by focusing on the actors in character, in this way I can still manage to catch the essence of the film,’ she wrote.            Marlon Brando, above, in a portrait that Sereny took on the film \u0027Last Tango in Paris,\u0027 which was released in 1973. In her book, \u0027Through Her Lens,\u0027 Sereny recounted how she convinced Brando to let her take his picture, telling him that he would get photo approval. But a French magazine, Paris Match, wanted the photos right away and she was unable to show him the images. She wrote: \u0027All he said was \u0027Don’t worry, Eva: you make the choice. I was able to gain Brando’s trust in me and my work. What a great feeling!’          In her book, \u0027Through Her Lens,\u0027 Serent wrote: ‘Working with someone like Fellini was extraordinary. He was an artist who worked without brush or palette.

Sereny told DailyMail.com that she worked at times without an assistant - no small feat when cameras had to be loaded with film - and that she had three cameras around her neck and one in her hand while taking photos          In 1980, Sereny was assigned to take photos of Luciano Pavarotti for the London Observer Magazine. She went to his home in   Modena, Italy. ‘Larger than life in every way and he commanded attention. Well, he had every right – he was one of the greatest tenors of his time,’ she wrote. Sereny told DailyMail.com: ‘He smoked - I didn’t ask him to smoke’          Sereny took the above photo of Clint Eastwood while he was showing her where he would build his home in Carmel, California in the early 1970s. After beating the incumbent, Eastwood would end up being mayor of Carmel from 1986 until 1988, and has been active in politics, speaking at Republican National Conventions          Above, Robert Redford as the character Jay Gatsby. Sereny took photos on the set of \u0027The Great Gatsby,\u0027 the 1974 film adaption of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s classic novel of the same name. The film starred Redford and Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, and was directed by Jack ClaytonA year or two later, she then took photos on the set of Luchino Visconti’s 1971 film ‘Death in Venice.’ The photos she took of one of the film\u0027s star, Italian actress Silvana Mangano, in costume were featured in The Sunday Times Magazine.‘That’s how everything started for me. It was enormous,’ she recalled. By the times the 1980s rolled around, Sereny had already been the special photographer for several well-known directors and their sets, including Peter Bogdanovich’s 1975 ‘At Long Last Love’ starring Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds.     Producer Frank Marshall helped her get the gig on the set of ‘At Long Last Love.\u0027‘He would turn out to become one of my strongest supporters over the years,’ she wrote.After Marshall joined Steven Spielberg’s team for ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ – the first film of the blockbuster Indiana Jones movies – he called her up and asked her to be the special photographer on set.‘That’s how an extraordinary adventure began for me,’ Sereny wrote.Sereny took snaps on three of the films: ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,’ released in 1981, ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,’ out in theaters in 1984, and ‘Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,’ released in 1989. She traveled to sets in Tunisia, Sri Lanka, and Marbella in Spain.‘Of course, working on a Spielberg movie is something very special. Just seeing Steven direct is fascinating,’ she wrote.Sereny used to shoot with four cameras: two for black and white, and two for color. Three would be slung around her neck, the fourth in her hand. She often worked without an assistant during a time when cameras needed their film loaded.‘I always wanted to be quick,’ she said about the four cameras. ‘You just had to feel which one was right.’Adding with a laugh: ‘I don’t know how I did it. I really don’t.’Sereny pegged her incredible career to luck and being ready when opportunities arose.‘It’s been a very strange journey doing this book,’ she told DailyMail.com.‘It was an extraordinary journey because many of the times I could not remember… how, when I did do these things. I sometimes think, “Good God, I did that?” ‘             In the spring of 1971, Sereny got a call from actress Romy Schneider whom she had just met a few days earlier on the set of Joseph Losey’s film ‘The Assassination of Trotsky,’ and asked if Sereny would take photos of her. ‘My heart skipped a beat. Romy Schneider was asking to have a photo session with me! This was a very unusual situation.

When she started taking photos on the set of director Herbert Ross’ ‘The Last of Sheila,’ released in 1973, Raquel Welch, she recalled, ‘shouted at me, “Who the hell are you?” ’ Ross, the director, come to Sereny’s side and let Welch know that she was alright to be on set. ‘I don’t want her here. I don’t want her here,’ Welch said. Sereny said she then ‘disappeared. So that was my first encounter with Raquel.\u0027 But later on the two became good work friends.

Ahead of an exhibition at the British Museum, Jonathan Jones charts its rise, from the 1893 original to today’s inflatables and emojisThe face is a greenish sock of sickly flesh stretched tight over the skull. Its features have been burned away by pain. All that remain in the elongated mask are two wide round eyes with dots for pupils, a pair of black nostrils and a mouth open in an oval scream. We’ve all been there.The Scream was created by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 but it has become a masterpiece – the masterpiece – for our time. There are comparably “iconic” works of art – the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Sunflowers – but they exist in a world of art and beauty. The Scream is ugly and brutal and belongs in the here and now. It is a symbol we reach for as we might for a strong word, to express what we’re feeling this minute.The cartoonist Peter Brookes called on it to sum up what so many were feeling when Donald J Trump was elected president of the United States. In Brookes’s depiction of Trump’s inauguration, every single person in the crowd has metamorphosed into the wraith-like figure from The Scream. They sway in unison, hands to their hollowed faces, clad in black smocks.You don’t have to be a professional cartoonist to express yourself with The Scream – you just need to text. The emoji sign “face screaming in fear” neatly sums up Munch’s image as a yellow face turning blue as it opens its mouth to scream, with eyes wide open, hands pressed to its cheeks in shock. It’s a handy emoji if you’re traumatised by Brexit … or climate change, or plastic in the oceans, or emojis.There are plenty of reasons to scream, says Hugo Chapman, the keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. “Is that not the feeling of our time?” he asks of Munch’s image. Chapman’s department is usually where scholars fill out forms to study Rubens drawings or old maps of Somerset, but its announcement of a new exhibition has sent headlines spinning simply because Edvard Munch: Love and Angst, which opens in April, will include the 1895 lithographic version of The Scream. Chapman says the museum has not been surprised by the shrieks of excitement. “We have hit at a time of maximum anxiety that all of us feel incredibly strongly,” he told me on the eve of the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.It is also a time of sardonic laughter, and surely part of the resonance of The Scream in these strange times is its comic hyperbole. A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch’s screamer on Trump’s inauguration day – and we still are – but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It’s A Scream used Munch’s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven’s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch’s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome.These examples of The Scream’s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch’s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today’s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway’s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard’s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: “It was two men and a ladder.” Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California’s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband.“I appeared as the man from the Getty,” says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you’ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch’s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage.The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch’s fin-de-siècle masterpiece suited another fin de siècle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year.If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word “scream” without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji.To see the revolutionary nature of Munch’s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord – this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania – as Oslo was then called – when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, “life had ripped open my soul”.Born in Ådalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: “Then it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens’ vault – The air became like blood – with piercing strands of fire – The fjord – glared in cold blue – yellow and red colours – bloody red screeched – on the road – and on the railing – My friends’ faces turned glaring yellow-white … ”This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy.The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo’s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us.By removing all iniduality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes – and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: “I felt a great scream – and I actually heard a great scream – The colours of nature broke up – the lines of nature – the lines and the colours – quivered in motion – These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate – they also brought my ear into vibration – so that I truly heard a scream – I then painted the picture Scream.”In Norwegian it is “skrik”, whose jarring note sounds more like the English “shriek” than “scream”. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state.The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we’re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnarök – the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream.

(I promptly corrected them: To-bay-go.) They knew of the country, although sometimes not its location, and I explained that we were a twin-island nation in the Caribbean, seven miles off the coast of Venezuela.After graduating, when I went backpacking around Europe, I found that few people had heard of Trinidad at all: I took to pulling out a little fold-out map and pointing to the little dot by way of explanation. “The Caribbean!” people exclaimed. They knew about the beaches, the endless sunshine. But later their faces would cloud over – what on earth had possessed me to leave such a wonderful place?1 I did my best to explain, but I don’t think I succeeded. I’m not sure I even knew myself, back then, except that it had always been the goal. And it was that goal – to escape, to get somewhere better – that sparked the idea for my novel, Golden Child. During my five years of writing it, I was trying, among other things, to understand that relentless drive to get away from the country where I had grown up.The books listed below are some of my favourites. Their themes preoccupied me while I was writing Golden Child: you’ll notice that the power of education looms large in our literature, unsurprising for a population once oppressed by slavery and indentureship. There’s sacrifice, crime, betrayal, love in many different forms, and, underneath it all, the longing for a better life.1. The Lonely Londoners by Sam SelvonWith the Windrush generation recently in the news, it seems appropriate to begin here. On a winter’s evening in the 1950s, Moses, a Trinidadian living in London, goes to Waterloo station to meet a compatriot arriving on the boat train. So begins the tale of freezing cold bedsits in Bayswater, of struggling to make ends meet. It’s also a story of friendships and hilarious romantic escapades – and, sometimes, disillusionment and intense homesickness.2. Letters from London: Seven Essays by CLR James, edited by Nicholas LaughlinWriter, thinker, historian, journalist, political activist and sportsman, James is one of the giants of postcolonial literature. These essays were originally published in Trinidad in 1932, soon after James’s (pre-Windrush) arrival in England. Covering subjects such as The Men, The Women and The Bloomsbury Atmosphere, they describe his early, candid impressions of the British imperial capital.3. A Naturalist’s Year by Richard ffrenchRichard ffrench came to Trinidad in the late 1950s, earning his living as a teacher and in his spare time researching and documenting the natural world around him. A Naturalist’s Year is a collection of some of the articles he wrote for the Trinidad and Tobago . The subject matter ranges from bats to tree snakes to birds of paradise, and gives a glimpse of everyday life in Trinidad and the locals who had made him feel so welcome.4. Crick Crack, Monkey by Merle HodgeA girl in Trinidad goes to live with an aunt after her own mother dies in childbirth, and then moves between two households, one poor, warm and and down-to-earth, and the other belonging to a higher, more educated social class. She learns the price she has paid for “moving up” in society: that she no longer belongs in the humble household where she was once happy. This deservedly enjoys classic status in the Caribbean.5. Measures of Expatriation by Vahni CapildeoThe 2016 winner of the Forward prize for best poetry collection. Some of the locations and experiences are recognisably Trinidadian, and yet the poems, and the larger work, transcend particularity. In one poem, “The mouth is planetary, circled by systematic tides” it is also “geographical to the extent that the body is terrain”.6. A House for Mr Biswas by VS Naipaul“I am chained to the hundred square miles that is Trinidad,” Naipaul wrote in 1954, “but I will evade that fate yet.” The sentence ends with a full stop, but whenever I read it, I imagine an exclamation mark instead, and the author rubbing his hands together with glee, a cartoon baddie’s wicked laughter echoing around him. This novel, widely regarded as his best, follows Mr Biswas from birth to death, as he tries – and often comically fails – to stake a place for himself in the world. Naipaul is a controversial figure in Britain and Trinidad alike, but there’s no disagreement about the quality of the writing: he was often praised as the greatest novelist of his time.7. The Whale House by Sharon MillarThese short stories are often sobering: a pathologist is asked to lie about a boy killed on government orders a 17-year-old boy sits in a car at dusk, waiting to kidnap a woman a gangster tells his story from beyond the grave. It honestly reflects contemporary Trinidad and Tobago society, with its racial tensions, still-open wounds of history, undercurrents of folklore and the supernatural.8. The Wine of Astonishment by Earl LovelaceWe studied this book at school, together with Shakespeare and John Steinbeck, and it felt like an awakening to read something written in our own language – still English, but our particular version of it. The story concerns a community of Spiritual Baptists in a rural village who are forbidden from practising their religion. Over many years, they manage to get a bright boy from their village educated and into local government – but once in power, he abandons them. Bolo, the champion stick-fighter of the village, is the only one brave enough to stand up for the community.9. History of the People of Trinidad and Tobago by Eric Williams Born in Trinidad in 1911 to a family of modest means, Williams excelled at school and won an island scholarship to St Catherine’s College, Oxford. He swiftly rose to the top of his class, ranking first among all Oxford history graduates in 1935. He completed a doctorate on the economics of the slave trade and then returned to Trinidad with a mission. He gave fiery open-air lectures in public squares, formed his own political party, steered the nation to independence in 1962 and became its first prime minister. This book was one of his many gifts to the newly formed nation of Trinidad and Tobago, and aimed to redress the great injustice that the people did not know their own history.10. De Rightest Place by Barbara JenkinsForget all the old-time books, here is one about the Trinidad of today, teeming with life and up-to-date Trini humour and steamy sex scenes. The action largely takes place a pub in Port of Spain and follows the antics of a wide cast of local characters of all races, religions and social classes. In the middle of it all is Indira, whose lover has recently left her, and who, at the beginning of the novel, takes stock of her assets in life. “Young, good looking, nice body,” she writes, admiring herself in the mirror. Read it first yourself, and then press it into the hands of the Trinidadians in your life.• Golden Child by Claire Adam is published by Faber \u0026amp Faber, priced £14.99.

Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The FCA’s Market Abuse Regulation extends the regulator’s reach to new markets, platforms and “behaviours” and aims to boost “market integrity and investor protection”.Additional scrutiny by the FCA could be significant as Britain hurtles towards a formal exit from the EU on 29 March. Interim events such as Tuesday’s parliamentary vote on Theresa May’s exit deal continue to grip markets and create opportunities for investors and hedge funds to cash in.“We are giving thought at this stage … as to whether we could usefully issue guidance, not obviously to change the rules but to issue guidance on the application of the rules, particularly on this question of inside information,” Bailey said.He pointed to similar work undertaken by the FCA to help the Office for National Statistics when it aimed to end the circulation of official data ahead of its release. That is despite the ONS falling outside the FCA’s regular jurisdiction.“We helped them to get that outcome using the market abuse regulation regime … it might be somewhere where guidance might help,” Bailey explained.The FCA chief is finally due to sit down with representatives of the British Polling Council and Market Research Society, which regulates the polling industry, from next week. The FCA publicly confirmed plans to meet both groups back in October.Morgan wrote to British Polling Council president, Sir John Curtice, in the autumn, highlighting concerns over “potential conflicts of interest in the business model of the polling industry”.She pointed to the practice of making market sensitive data such as exit polls available to private clients before it can be legally released to the public, and the way revenues from private polling work may help subsidise public work.“At worst, there could exist a perverse incentive for polling companies to provide misleading or inaccurate information to the media, while providing high-quality analysis on the true state of public opinion to private clients,” she said.Curtice hit back, saying: “The implication of this remark appears to be that during the EU referendum polling companies may have deliberately released inaccurate published polls at less than cost price because this enabled them to extract a higher fee from their private clients.“Casting doubt as it does on the professional integrity of the industry, it is a suggestion that we feel either needs to be substantiated or withdrawn.”The Treasury committee has not responded to Curtice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df2e32f53ce5e199a5c1b01d21e3d6ed5b4c554b/0_68_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae63cc5a7e90caea993906baeca3f1d","title":"marks and spencer stores close m and s hull","story":"M\u0026ampS outlets in Bedford, Hull, Huddersfield and Rotherham among those to be axed with 1,000 jobs at riskMarks \u0026amp Spencer has dealt a fresh blow to the high street as it announced another wave of store closures, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk.The struggling high street giant is closing one in three of its main stores – those that sell clothing, homewares and food under one roof – and on Tuesday revealed the locations of the next 17 branches to close in coming months.Sacha Berendji, the M\u0026ampS retail, operations and property director, said: “Proposing to close stores is never easy, for our colleagues, customers or the local community, but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS.”M\u0026ampS’s decision to retreat from a swathe of UK towns and cities comes as many high streets are struggling with fewer customers and the shift to online shopping. The most recent figures available showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty soared in the first six months of 2018.Despite its problems, M\u0026ampS, with its broad range of products, is a prized high street name as its stores attract 19.5 million shoppers every week. Local MPs and councillors vowed to try to persuade the company to reverse its decision.Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, also tweeted that she was “extremely disappointed” by the decision to close the store in her city and was seeking a meeting with management.She was joined by her Hull North colleague, Diana Johnson, who asked: “Why is one of the great cities of the north losing its Marks \u0026amp Spencer?”Another affected town is Ashford in Kent, which has been held up as an example of retail regeneration. But Graham Galpin, a senior Ashford councillor who helped write the recent government report into the UK’s beleaguered high street, was more pragmatic: “There is simply too much retail space in the UK, hence we must expect some reductions.”The store closures, spread over a five-year period, are part of the latest M\u0026ampS plan to tackle years of falling sales and profits. The cull began in 2017 after the chief executive, Steve Rowe, said he would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M\u0026ampS’s clothing ranges as sales transferred to its website.M\u0026ampS has about 1,000 stores, a figure that includes 300 “main” stores and a large network of Simply Food convenience outlets. About one-third of the first group are said to date from before the second world war. M\u0026ampS has confirmed the locations of 55 of the 100 affected stores.The shopworkers’ union Usdaw said M\u0026ampS’s “piecemeal approach” was extremely distressing for staff. “Today we’ve seen a fourth wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else,” said Usdaw’s national officer, David Gill.The company has refused to rule out an even bigger store closure plan.The locations of the 17 stores announced on Tuesday are:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cae7b4b509fbc50b9c3aaa265890a3c54dd9812/0_81_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8bd17bc1e0594d583654a2b6984d47","title":"a three generation project riverside development divides indian city","story":"The next 15 megacities #6: New facilities by the Sabarmati will provide Ahmedabad with much-needed public space, but at what cost?by Payal Mohta in AhmedabadAs the sun dips below the horizon, young lovers make themselves more comfortable on benches overlooking the Sabarmati river. Walkers stroll along the concrete promenades, and mothers enjoy a moment of respite under newly planted saplings while their children play in the adjoining gardens.Few Ahmedabad residents could have imagined this scene a couple of decades ago. Back then the Gujarati city’s tidal river banks were lined with slum housing – precariously constructed on land polluted by industrial effluent and untreated sewage, and home to some of the most marginalised communities in the city.Over the coming years this central location will transform yet further. Retaining walls have been built on both sides to narrow the river to stop it from flooding low-lying developments and eroding the riverbank, in a project likened to Joseph Bazalgette’s embankments along the Thames in London, or those along the Seine in Paris and Hudson in New York. The newly created land will be home to shopping malls, luxury hotels, floating restaurants, museums and sprawling parks.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.“The worst part of the city, with flowing gutters and illegal constructions, has been converted into an iconic infrastructure project,” says Vijay Nehra, the commissioner of Ahmedabad, whose municipal corporation has spent more than 15bn rupees (£170m) on the scheme.The riverfront redevelopment model is being copied by several other Indian cities, from New Delhi to Mumbai, but as Ahmedabad’s population nears 10 million, not everyone is happy with the changes taking place – least of all the slum dwellers who have been relocated away from the city centre, the upstream farmers worried about their water supply and the environmentalists concerned the Sabarmati remains one of the country’s 15 most polluted rivers.The idea of a public riverfront was first proposed in the 1960s by the French architect Bernard Kohn, who was living in Ahmedabad at the time, as part of a vision for an ecological valley. Lack of funds meant it was shelved for the next 30 years.It was given new life in a different form in the mid-90s when the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) took charge of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. (The BJP’s Narendra Modi, a local politician, is now India’s prime minister.) Bimal Patel – son of the late Hasmukh Patel, an influential architect whose buildings dot the city’s skyline – and his HCP Design and Project Management firm were hired to draw up a masterplan.But before the first concrete could be poured, the tens of thousands of people who called the area home, many for three generations or more, had to be removed. The riverbed had become a dumping ground for the city’s waste and the area was rampant with disease, while floods frequently led to deaths and the destruction of dwellings. The clothes washers and small-scale farmers were dependent on the river directly, while others such as domestic workers and ragpickers relied on its central location.Government surveys conducted before the construction began in 2005 identified 11,000 families who would be displaced – although activists believe the actual number was three times higher.The Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation spent some 11bn rupees (£124m) building new housing for those who would lose their homes, but Beena Jadhav, director of the Ahmedabad-based housing rights NGO Rahethan Adhikar Manch, says the process was mismanaged.“Not a single family walked from their houses by the river to the ones given by the government without a phase of being homeless,” she says. “There were many demolitions without an eviction notice.”Even those who left voluntarily found themselves unable to get work in the new location. Noorja Abdullah Pathan, 56, says: “The new government home felt like a private bungalow compared to where I lived before but I cannot find any work here. I can’t afford to travel for it either. I am always begging for food or dying of hunger. At least by the river I survived.”It is not just the development’s effect on the riverbank that is controversial – its effect on the water is too.The project has seen the tidal river, which was 679 metres across at its widest, narrowed to a regular 329 metres. “Pinching the river for a uniform width and building embankments have lowered the Sabarmati’s flood-carrying capacity,” says Mahesh Pandya, the founder of Paryavaran Mitra, an observer organisation for the UN Framework Convention On Climate Change. “This was always a project just for beautification. No environmental assessment has been done.”Meanwhile, activists are worried that the water supply for farmers in drought-prone parts of Gujarat will be affected by the project. Water from the Narmada canal – a multipurpose dam project that irrigates more than 3,000 villages across the state – was used as part of the scheme, and levels of the dam have since been recorded at their lowest in 13 years. The state government has vowed to stop the city from using the Narmada’s water free of charge, and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation insists new treatment plants will prevent any untreated sewage from entering the river within three years.Patel, though, considers his project to be on track. “With these homes along the river there was no way for the residents of Ahmedabad to access the waterfront,” he says. “The key objectives have always been to create a public realm along the river, clean the water and rehabilitate those affected by the project. Now a huge public space is available for 7 million people.”But he cautions that the development is a long-term project. “The problems Indian cities face today are the challenges their European counterparts faced in the 19th century,” he says. “Their solutions, like controlling tidal rivers with embankments, remain the same.“It took over 70 years to clean the Thames. I am not saying it will take that long for the Sabarmati, but developing a riverfront is a three-generation project.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30a2b1e47d42c584ba5cf7431c91b905c4346435/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f50ba543129f8e9d6d20cc622611f4","title":"britain theresa may must go brexit","story":"So now we know. With the clock ticking rapidly towards 29 March, Theresa May’s Brexit has been defeated – and in devastating style. This was the worst government defeat in British history.The contradictions and dissembling the prime minister engaged in over the past two years have at last caught up with her. The final vote matched even the most doom-laden predictions.Defeat – even by a single vote, never mind 230 – was always going to be catastrophic. This was May’s flagship policy, on the issue that has dominated her agenda since her first day in office, back in July 2016. And she has failed to get support for it – from opposition MPs, her coalition partners, the DUP and, most crucially and embarrassingly, from a huge chunk of her own party.It could all have been so different. On her first day in office she said she stood for national unity. Yet within days May was uttering those ludicrous soundbites, “Brexit means Brexit” and “red, white and blue Brexit” as she bent over backwards to appease the hard right of her party. She talked tough, losing potential allies in Brussels, and set out those fateful red lines that ended the option of a customs union or single market.And then, to cap it all, she called an election – when 20 points ahead in the polls – and, after a disastrous campaign, lost her majority and her ability to make her own deals.May’s 30 months in office have been marked by incompetence and ineptitude, matched only by her self-delusion in believing, whatever humiliation she suffers, that “nothing has changed”.Some put this down to a sense of duty. More likely, as with all other leaders who cling on beyond their sellby date, it’s the shame of being turfed out of office.So we are left with the government in paralysis. She is unable to negotiate with Europe because she can’t deliver on any agreed deal unable to be kicked out by her party, even though more than a third of its members want her out unable to call an election because she knows her party will probably be beaten (and she has already promised them she won’t stand again).Under May, Britain has become a laughing stock around the world. Her dithering, her serial U-turns, the fact her words can’t be trusted, are dragging down the reputation of the entire nation. The longer she continues in office, the worse this will become.After her devastating defeat, Theresa May tried gamely to set out her agenda for the next few weeks. Right now, for Britain’s sake, May’s only plan should be to leave office. To unblock the political gridlock, there has to be another leader: one who can negotiate afresh with Europe and who can call an election to try to win a majority for whatever they agree. May’s reputation is shot. Regardless of whether she cobbles together enough support to see off Labour’s vote of no confidence tomorrow, she must go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ed479dd34c13a7f40bd38c7547151a6e6aa3b4/0_0_1482_889/master/1482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d538e422f9a257190e52bfcc08d8d91","title":"corbyn labour referendum left leader","story":"Until now, the left’s voice has been missing. This is the moment when the Labour leader can change hearts and mindsAt last! Labour’s hour has come. Until now, Labour’s voice has been almost unheard in the greatest debate of our time. Jeremy Corbyn has now been obliged to call a vote of no confidence in a government whose policy has crashed in ignominy. No one predicted the monumental, breathtaking scale of this.Theresa May and her government look set to survive, as Jacob Rees-Mogg dashed out to tell the cameras he would support her against the no-confidence motion. Turkeys – even such a turkey as this Conservative administration – don’t vote for their own demise they just lead the country to it.The chances are that May stumbles on, because there is no one else. Useless though she has been, the constitutional dilemma would be no more soluble under any of the other turkeys lining up in her party to take her place.Jeremy Corbyn has no choice now but to steam ahead and at last lead the party he has always promised to obey. Labour members are remainers, overwhelmingly, and they want a vote to decide the country’s fate after these excruciating years of stasis. The majority of people who voted Labour in 2017 support another people’s vote, according the ESRCYouGov poll and others. Whatever his own views, he has no other course but to do what Tony Benn, his mentor, always argued for – listen to his own party, who go about in T-shirts emblazoned with “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit”.Once the mumbling and doublespeak, the prevarication and the hesitation have at last departed, a remain-supporting Labour frontbench going hell for leather for a referendum will alter the balance of this great debate utterly. The left’s voice has been missing. Whatever pundits say about the Brexit ide cutting across left and right, that’s wrong. Rightwing extreme ideology has motivated the prime movers in this – the wicked, long-term instigators of this national disaster. Labour must fearlessly expose the true nature of the Brexit enterprise throughout all those leave-voting Labour seats.Never forget, it was Tory voters – the shires, the Tory elderly – who were the backbone of the Brexit vote. Those left-behind Labour towns were a small, if worrying, part of the result. Those places can and must be won back, now that Labour has chosen to no longer be muffled. Roll on a splendid Labour campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e57ca7e9b0d16aa7701e154d67acbfc590e8316e/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73c39d2868c0e7c12c31689b2b212bc","title":"the guardian view on mays brexit deal its over but whats next","story":"The PM leads a party that is ided and a country stockpiling food and medicines as if preparing for war. She needs to humbly reach out to her opponents and find a way to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU in weeksThe overwhelming and decisive rejection by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement to leave the European Union is a shattering blow to the authority of the prime minister. She has spent two years negotiating a deal, which in substance was the opposite of what she said she wanted in public, only to see it repudiated by parliament. Her minority government has now been defeated on no fewer than 28 occasions. Britain is leaving the EU in weeks and Mrs May leads a cabinet that is hopelessly split, a party that is riven with disagreements and a country that is deeply ided. So emphatic is the Commons historic rebuff that Mrs May’s deal is finished. Mrs May lost by 230 votes – the greatest defeat of a government ever. The scale of the opposition means it is not credible Mrs May could bring the motion back to the Commons, modified with a few tweaks from Brussels, and hope for success a second time round.We do not have to settle for the Hobson’s choice of the May deal or no deal. The trouble is the Tory party is split between those who want a deal and those who do not. Mrs May has intensified the isions within her party, rather than resolve them. She chose to start negotiations over Brexit not with the EU but with her own hardliners. The red lines Mrs May subsequently set made it impossible for her to get a deal that would bring her fractious party together, let alone reach out to her political opponents. Her agreement ended up shaped by Mrs May’s obsession with immigration and placating Brexit extremists. The result is a “blindfold Brexit” – where almost everything about the future relationship with Europe is up in the air for two more years. It required a leap of faith to place trust in a prime minister who, the Commons wisely decided, deserved very little.In the current circumstances, there is no majority in parliament for any of the alternative Brexit deals. This could lead to a disaster: Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. That is why MPs must remove it as an option. Labour has triggered a vote of no confidence in the government but is unlikely to win. That points to the need for a mechanism to allow a Commons majority to take control of the Brexit process. This would require innovation, of the kind seen last week, so committees can be empowered and laws brought forward. But to have other options would require asking the EU for more time. It requires parliamentary cooperation of the kind hitherto unseen. Jeremy Corbyn and Mrs May ought not to stand in the way of such dealings. Constitutional devices such as citizens’ assemblies, raised by Labour MP Lisa Nandy, and another referendum would allow leaders to hold their parties together and provide legitimacy for whatever the public decides. These are not denials of democracy but a reinforcement of it.Mrs May’s decision to put party politics ahead of national interest means this country will aimlessly drift as the government attempts to recast a withdrawal agreement. An absence of leadership can lead to a sense of panic, one inflated by a government stockpiling food and medicines as if preparing for a war. We need to end the chaos and ision that have done so much to disfigure our country. The question we face is whether there can be a durable relationship between Brexit Britain and the EU, which allows both to cooperate on the basis of shared interests and values. Mrs May left it far too late to accept the costs of leaving, preferring to pander to MPs whose snake-oil sales pitch is that there will not be any cost associated with Brexit at all. “Having your cake and eating it” is the Brexiter attitude that encapsulates this inability to think in terms of costs and benefits.Yet coming clean about these things is necessary to move forward. The country now faces a situation without precedent in its constitutional history: how to reconcile the sovereignty of the people with the sovereignty of parliament. The prime minister has been humbled into admitting she needs to win her opponents over. The Brexit vote was driven by stagnant wages, regional disparities and a soulless form of capital accumulation. These were not caused by the EU, nor will they be solved by leaving it. Only policies enacted by purposeful government can do that. Mrs May has not provided either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ced594e256933a8a4949dae5f57c3ffc8fa9cd7e/0_256_4644_2787/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5764c84b40aff8fdf9c067799b50d025","title":"ofsted to reform school inspections in bid to tackle off rolling","story":"New guidelines will shift focus towards quality of education rather than ‘outcomes’The way nurseries, schools and colleges in England are inspected is to undergo its biggest overhaul in a decade, with proposals by Ofsted aiming to address concerns that education has been too narrowly focused on exam results.The new guidelines will be launched by Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, in a speech on Wednesday, with a consultation on revised inspection frameworks for state and independent schools as well as early years settings and further education colleges.Under the new proposals, schools that push out less able children – a practice known as “off-rolling” – or teach a narrow curriculum designed solely to improve test results and gaming league table rankings risk being punished by Ofsted’s inspectors.Sean Harford, Ofsted’s national director of education, said the new frameworks “cover all the way from birth through to adult learning”, with an emphasis on the quality of education, a new inspection category that will replace “outcomes” as one of the four main areas under which schools will be inspected.In her speech Spielman is to say: “The new quality of inspection judgment will look at how providers are deciding what to teach and why, how well they are doing it and whether it is leading to strong outcomes for young people.“This will reward those who are ambitious and make sure that young people accumulate rich, well-connected knowledge and develop strong skills using this knowledge.”Luke Tryl, Ofsted’s director of corporate strategy, said that inspections would no longer place as much weight on data in forming their judgment. “We are not saying outcomes don’t matter, but we have reached the limits of what data alone can tell us,” he said. Inspectors will have a longer period to assess the quality of teaching and will interview staff as part of the process.The proposals were welcomed by Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England.“I remain extremely concerned about the number of schools gaming the system and fiddling exam league tables through off-rolling, and I hope that Ofsted will grasp this opportunity to come down hard on schools who are letting down some of the most vulnerable children,” Longfield said.The new framework was also backed by Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England: “As we have improved the curriculum and reformed GCSEs and A-levels, we have been fully united with Ofsted in our drive to ensure all children and young people benefit from an ambitious, broad and balanced curriculum.“This framework reflects that approach and our continuing activity around exclusions and off-rolling.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, welcomed the move to address off-rolling but said more significant reform was needed to ensure that Ofsted didn’t add to the pressures on teachers.“Labour will address these issues by giving our schools the resources they need, reforming the accountability system and taking concrete steps to end the scandal of off-rolling,” Rayner said.The National Association of Head Teachers said it was calling on its members to use the consultation to amend the proposed framework.“In its current form, this proposal from Ofsted will cause widespread concern amongst school leaders. There’s nothing here that will reduce stress and increase the reliability of judgements, which many say is sorely needed,” said Nick Brook, the NAHT’s deputy general secretary.The new framework will also see an increased emphasis on behaviour and attitudes in a revised category, with schools able to be rated as having outstanding behaviour if pupils “behave with consistently high respect for others”. In particular it notes that schools in “challenging circumstances” need to take action to create a “positive learning environment” to be awarded outstanding status.A recent Ofsted inspection of a secondary school in Poole, Magna Academy, saw inspectors endorse its use of “silent corridor” policies, with pupils barred from talking while moving between lessons.A new inspection area – personal development – will rate how a school prepares pupils for life in modern Britain, while the leadership category will now encompass issues such as off-rolling, which Harford defined as “getting rid of people because they’re not going to get the right scores”.In a nod to an ongoing dispute among teachers, Ofsted’s consultation document notes that “a isive debate has emerged in some quarters that creates an unnecessary opposition between knowledge and skills” and concludes that the two are “closely interconnected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bc99c80382c1b12fd3ed2baf8f5e69a9a048f55/0_286_4291_2575/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b26eab7393e639241944573950b0fb9","title":"land sparing farms could revitalise uk bird populations study says","story":"Claim that more intensive farming would allow rewilding of greater areas of countryside“Land sparing” could lead to dramatic increases in wild bird populations, according to research that bolsters the case for rewilding.Farming intensively to increase yields while turning over much larger areas of farmland to wildlife could – if combined with measures to cut food waste and meat consumption – would meet Britain’s food needs and more than double the populations of breeding birds.Increasing yields is controversial among some conservationists who argue that intensive farming is unsustainable. Upland farmers also object because they fear land sparing will force them to give up farming and rewild their hillsides, while the fertile lowlands are intensively farmed.In research presented to a rewilding conference organised by the Cambridge Conservation Forum, Balmford and a team of researchers studied food production and birdlife on the Cambridgeshire Fens to model how a far greater area of farmland could be devoted to wildlife.“We’re not arguing for business-as-usual industrial farming but we have to be mindful of yield,” said Balmford.He said there was a risk that post-Brexit payments for farmers could improve Britain’s landscape but reduce food production, leading to more food being imported from countries where the environment is being destroyed.He said: “We need a twin-track where we get serious about using some of our landscape in a way that’s much better for bioersity and ecosystem services but that must be linked to incentives enabling some farmers to be productive in sustainable ways on remaining farmland. If we don’t, it’s a sleight of hand – we’ll just buy our food from somewhere else and offshore the problem.”While organic farmers and most conservationists fear raising yields would lead to more environmental damage such as greenhouse gas emissions and increased nitrate pollution, recent research by Balmford and colleagues found that in four types of farming, including European dairy farming and wheat production, intensive systems were often less polluting per unit of production than organic and low-intensity agriculture.But Balmford said there was not enough data on other “externalities” such as soil erosion to measure the full, long-term costs of high-yield farming. On the Fens, for instance, there is scant data on soil erosion. The Fens’ fertile, peaty soil being washed away or eroded by the wind could prevent high-yield farming in the future.If land sparing is taken up in the post-Brexit farm payments being developed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, some fear it could lead to unprofitable upland farms being turned over to nature while fertile lowlands are intensively farmed.This was criticised at the conference by Dafydd Morris-Jones, a Welsh hill farmer who said land sparing was quite attractive if you were a large-scale grain farmer, “because it’s your land that will be concentrated on to be productive and our land that won’t”.Morris-Jones said he would prefer to see land sparing used within inidual farms. “With better conversations, more nuanced thinking and a great deal more data, the uplands would be able to provide sustainable food while providing ecological and environmental benefits. I don’t think they are in conflict.”Morris-Jones accused rewilding of being “eco-colonialism” forced upon Welsh upland farmers by the English, pricing out locals and eroding their landscape, culture and community.“Rewilding has become a toxic term in mid-Wales,” he said. Of the argument that upland farming could be replaced by ecotourism, he said: “I can’t see how careers in the voluntary-supported Wildlife Trusts or low-paid and exceptionally seasonal work offered by the tourism industry will pay the mortgage. As for payments for ecosystem services and public goods, I just don’t think it will be capable of sustaining that richly varied rural economy that we rely upon to keep our culture, language and community alive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81f09091530e2cf1ca4b5c4e4aafac71b88279b5/0_225_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=badd70a0cebe9f66882211b2e32d7401","title":"arsenal head recruitment sven mislintat future","story":"• Mislintat’s chances of move to technical director had slimmed• German feared role would become that of glorified chief scoutArsenal’s grand plans to restructure post-Arsène Wenger have begun to splinter with Sven Mislintat, brought in as head of recruitment, set to leave after feeling his position has become untenable.The German, whose ideas in the sphere of spotting and developing talent are highly regarded in European football, was initially appointed in November 2017 by Ivan Gazidis, with the idea that his role would evolve into that of a technical director as the club aimed to refresh its operation once they moved on from the Wenger era.Wenger was no fan of the technical director concept and brushed aside the idea, which was one the club were keen to move towards. Since Gazidis departed to join Milan and handed over to a new internal management scheme led by the director of football, Raul Sanllehi, and the managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, Mislintat’s chances of becoming technical director have diminished.He was the natural choice but with Arsenal looking elsewhere, including towards their former midfielder Edu (currently a coordinator for Brazil’s national team), Mislintat has sensed that he would be sidelined, no longer having a decisive say on prospective signings. It seemed like his position, instead of growing as he had hoped, would be reduced to that of a glorified chief scout, which is not what he moved from Borussia Dortmund to do.Quite apart from the experience he can bring to the role, Mislintat will be a loss to Arsenal as a person. In character and ideas, he shares something of Jürgen Klopp’s rock and roll vibe and has a similar bigger-picture belief in football’s capacity to pay attention to the game’s soul in a heavily financed modern world. He also had a lot to offer to the strategic overhaul intended to refresh the way the club operates at executive level, and brought with him a modern way of thinking and a strong passion for his area of expertise.Mislintat has in recent months been part of the new executive team set up to bring a shared leadership which included his fellow German Per Mertesacker as head of the academy as well as senior figures from the business, football, contracts and data side of the club. He is the kind of person who is keen to bring his own ideas to the table, without feeling the need to adhere to convention. Down to earth, as interested in people as performances, his attributes extend beyond just having a good eye for a potential player.Before moving to London he spent many years at Dortmund, where he helped in the development of Shinji Kagawa, Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembélé, among others. This track record made him an exciting appointment for the overdue modernisation of recruitment at Arsenal. Dortmund are an example to aspire to for a club hoping to streamline their operation and become more efficient in the market by spotting potential talent before it becomes prohibitively expensive.Mislintat was heavily involved in the recruitment of Aubameyang a year ago. Arsenal then signed a range of players during last summer’s transfer window – the goalkeeper Bernd Leno, experienced defenders Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Stephan Lichtsteiner, and the youthful, zesty Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi in midfield.But there is unease during this January window with Emery having admitted recently that the club are able to bring players in only on loan. With Aaron Ramsey set to leave on a free transfer at the end of the season, Petr Cech announcing his retirement, Danny Welbeck’s contract unlikely to be renewed and the ongoing bafflement over the situation engulfing their highest earner, Mesut Özil, this is far from an ideal time to have upheaval on the recruitment front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21928cd79b4308e978ad3c09ae2ec142fb8f6490/530_924_4647_2788/master/4647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf00a8857a7f1834590e5cd9dc20f45d","title":"manchester city refuse comment uefa ffp allegations","story":"• Club argues claims are based on ‘hacked or stolen’ emails• Uefa wrote to City inviting comment before ChristmasManchester City have refused to give Uefa any comment on allegations that they breached financial fair play regulations and misled the governing body because the club argues the claims were based on “hacked or stolen” emails.The Uefa committee responsible for FFP wrote to City before Christmas inviting comment on allegations reported in the German magazine Der Spiegel that the club’s declarations in 2013-15 were “a web of lies”.City responded that the allegations were based on “hacked or stolen” emails, and challenged Uefa to support stronger protection against hacking. No actual investigation of the club is understood to have begun Uefa and its club financial control body (CFCB) are understood to be considering whether to launch one.Der Spiegel based the allegations on a small number of emails it claimed had been leaked to it by an anonymous person based in Portugal, given the name John. Spiegel said that “John” denied the internal emails, from City, Uefa, Fifa and several other football clubs and organisations, were hacked, saying that he had good sources.The magazine claimed most damagingly that short extracts from four internal emails showed that City’s sponsorships, by the Abu Dhabi airline Etihad and other state-owned companies, were in fact mostly paid by City’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a senior member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Etihad itself did deny in a public statement that the money came from Mansour, saying the airline’s “financial obligations … have always been … the sole liability and responsibility of Etihad Airways”, but City refused to engage with the substance of the allegations.When the CFCB wrote inviting comment, City are understood to have replied with a similar stance to their public position since the allegations were published: a refusal to engage with the stories because the emails were hacked or stolen, and taken out of context. The letter from City is said by informed sources to have argued that as Uefa’s own internal emails were also published, it should support City and other clubs to strengthen European football’s cyber-security.As City refused to comment but did not deny that the emails quoted were genuine, the CFCB and Uefa officials are now understood to be discussing internally how to proceed. Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, and Yves Leterme, chairman of the CFCB investigatory chamber, have spoken publicly in general terms that the strongest sanction for a club found to be seriously in breach of the rules is expulsion from the Champions League. City’s refusal to comment appears to be a determined policy in relation to perceived cyber-hacks. The club’s senior hierarchy, including the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, are also senior political figures in Abu Dhabi, which has been subject to previous hacking or email leaks. The response in those cases has also been not to comment on the substance of what was published.City’s only statement since the allegations was: “We will not be providing any comment on out of context materials purportedly hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people. The attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear.”The financial information required for FFP is collected by national leagues, which are delegated responsibility for Uefa’s licensing system. If Uefa did embark on an investigation, which it is under pressure from La Liga and other clubs to do, the Premier League would have to ask City for further confidential information, potentially including internal emails. Leterme and Uefa officials are thought to be assessing whether the potential result of any investigation warrants such an escalation, which City are likely to oppose.The CFCB did find City in breach of the permitted FFP losses in May 2014 and the club agreed to a range of sanctions, but it did not find that the Etihad sponsorship, now of the club’s shirt, stadium and new training “campus”, was overvalued. Owners can put money into clubs via sponsorships, as long as the price paid is considered fair market value."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d5d2aa8738bae4492b0d21b04c24f0eada6eafc/0_216_4820_2892/master/4820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16cb7f48a1c24fb46c92350725932a4e","title":"which football teams doctored their playing surface to hinder opponents","story":"Plus: top-scoring defenders, non-league double delight and strange middle names. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Pep Guardiola says he didn’t leave the Etihad grass long against Liverpool. But which teams or managers have used this tactic to help their own side or hinder an opponent?” asks George Jones.Stuart Smith cites a famous example from the legendary match between Wolves and Honved in 1954. “When Ferenc Puskas and the mighty Honved came to Molineux to play under floodlights, Wolves manager Stan Cullis had the pitch flooded and then rollered to appear playable. Honved took an early 2-0 lead, but the pitch turned into a bog reminiscent of a cattle field and Wolves ran out 3-2 winners, prompting Cullis to declare his side the best in the world.” You can read more about that famous match right here.José Mourinho has a tale or two to tell, too. He was Chelsea manager when, in February 2005, Blackburn saturated the pitch on the afternoon of their Premier League game. Chelsea won 1-0 and Mourinho had plenty to say afterwards. “During the afternoon it rained only in this stadium – our kitman saw it. There must be a microclimate here. The pitch was like a swimming pool.”There was apparently a hosepipe ban within the Bernabéu, and a drastic shortage of lawn mowers across Madrid, when Mourinho’s Real Madrid hosted Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona in April 2011. Xavi accused Madrid of preparing a dry, hard pitch with much longer grass than usual. “It’s deplorable,” said the ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.Brendan Rodgers and Craig Levein had a public spat after last year’s Celtic game at Hearts, and then there’s Trelleborgs FF. “When hosting Hammarby IF during the 2018 season, Trelleborgs decided to not only leave the grass long but also not water it before the game, all to slow down the tempo,” writes Gillis Holgersson. “It didn’t work – Hammarby won 3-1 and Trelleborg ended up relegated. Their stadium is frequently voted the least enjoyable away game in Sweden.”“Chorley’s top scorer in all competitions is their left-back despite the club being top of the Vanarama National North,” tweets Gaz F. “What is the highest league finish a team has achieved with a defender top-scoring over the season?”Sometimes the best form of attack is a defender. The original slabhead, Steve Bruce, was Manchester United’s top scorer with 19 goals in 1990-91, when they finished sixth in the old Division One and beat Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona Dream Team to win the Cup Winners’ Cup.There are a few teams who have won their league with a defender as top scorer. “In the 2001-02 season Plymouth Argyle won Division Three with a then record total of 102 points,” notes Tom Aldous. “Our joint top scorer was current Bristol Rovers manager Graham Coughlin with 11 goals. I imagine that all of them were imperious headers from set pieces.”Alastair Bourne nominates Lincoln centre-half Sam Ellis, who used his loaf to score 15 times when they won the old Division Four in 1974-75.But Bruce, Coughlin, Ellis and the rest must bow down and kiss the left boot of Eric Van Meir. “​When Lierse were surprise winners of the Belgian Pro League in 1997, the central defender Van Meir was their highest scorer with 16 goals,” writes Stijn. “He was excellent in the air and had a left foot like a traction engine, scoring headers, free kicks and penalties. Lierse’s attacking duo Dirk Huysmans and Bob Peeters (once of Millwall) only managed 14 goals between them during their fairytale season.”“Has any team managed to win the non-league double of National League champions and FA Trophy winners?” muses CB Kendall.This is an easy question to answer, especially when a cherished reader does all the work for us. “Wealdstone were the first team to achieve this feat back in 1984-85 when the National League was known as the Gola League,” writes Rob Read. “They followed up winning the league by defeating Boston United 2-1 at the old Wembley. Fun fact – Vinnie Jones was in the Wealdstone squad, but didn’t play at Wembley. Since then Colchester United (1991-92) and Martin O’Neill’s Wycombe Wanderers (1992-93) have managed the non-league double. However no team have won the double since the (Vanarama) National League has been in existence.”A couple of teams did achieve the feat in the pre-Conference days, however.Years ago my boyfriend told me that Bob Wilson’s middle name is Primrose,” wrote Sharon Barnes in February 2002. “Is this true or am I a victim of an elaborate hoax?”It’s true Sharon.

Fast-forward seven weeks and Nigel Adkins’s side are the country’s form team, suddenly looking up rather than down. Six league wins on the bounce have propelled them to within four points of the play-offs, while the maligned vice-chairman, Ehab Allam, has spoken of renewed optimism. It has been a concerted team effort but no player has been more instrumental than Jarrod Bowen, who has scored nine goals in his past eight matches.Hull have done some shrewd business in recent years – handsomely profiting from the sales of Harry Maguire and Andy Robertson to Leicester City and Liverpool respectively – but, considering they did not pay a penny for Bowen in July 2014 after he left the now defunct Hereford United, the 22-year-old forward may well top the lot. Before arriving in east Yorkshire Bowen held talks with West Bromwich Albion and Wolves but joined Hull, for whom he made his Premier League debut three years ago, after impressing the then academy manager and now first-team coach, Tony Pennock. He is not the only one flying the flag for Hereford in the Football League, with Sam Clucas at Stoke and Marley Watkins at Bristol City.Bowen, a workaholic with a sweet left foot and an insatiable appetite for goals, has scored five in his past three matches, in which Hull have hit 11 without reply. With 13 goals in this campaign, he is three away from eclipsing last season’s tally with four months of the season to play. On Saturday he will try to build on those numbers at Villa Park, against the team who rejected him at the age of 10 and at the stadium where he scored his first Hull goal last year, sending his watching family into frenzy in the away end. Bowen’s journey is a refreshing tale, from cleaning boots and sweeping changing rooms at Edgar Street to being eulogised in front of tens of thousands.Less than five years ago a 17-year-old Bowen was part of the Hereford team that defeated Welling in front of 480 spectators at the tail end of a season that was followed by the club’s expulsion from the fifth tier for failing to pay creditors and, a few months later, by their liquidation. He had signed for Hereford as a scholar shortly after joining the youth team – led by the former Bristol Rovers striker Peter Beadle – following a six-week trial at Cardiff City. Bowen impressed in the FA Youth Cup, helping Hereford to the fourth round, where a Manchester City team including Angus Gunn prevailed in extra time. When Martin Foyle resigned as manager in March 2014 with the club haemorrhaging money, Beadle assumed caretaker charge for the last eight games and threw in Bowen at the deep end: he made his debut at Barnet and scored what proved the winner against Alfreton as Hereford won three of their final five matches.As a scholar, Bowen was hardly earning megabucks (around £70 a week) but he too went without. He was thrust into a relegation fight in an increasingly toxic atmosphere, a result of a growing discord between fans and his troubled local club Bowen was born 13 miles up the A49, in Leominster. “Nobody was getting paid, playing staff or management staff,” Beadle says. “How many players these days would have stayed and played for nothing, for their own futures? Not many would have done that but they did. For Jarrod to go through that at that age, and he has also been a part of a relegation from the Premier League, that would have been tough.“To watch the team that he had a soft spot for as a kid crumble around him and fall away must have been desperately hard for him at 16 and 17. To then be brave enough and say: ‘I’m going to move away from home’, and probably about as far away as he could, to earn a career in football says a lot. He has seen lots of highs and lots of lows that will all stand him in good stead because he knows how good it can be but also how bad things can get.”• In the four tiers of English league football, only Luton are on a longer unbeaten run than Bristol City, with Lee Johnson’s side having not tasted defeat in 10 matches. City have won their past four games, with the debutant Kasey Palmer, one of three players on loan from Chelsea, striking the winner against Bolton to push the Robins to within two points of sixth-placed Derby. As for Palmer, who spent the first half to the season on loan at Blackburn, Johnson is adamant the forward can thrive as a No 10. “This time last year we were flogging the same lads and couldn’t maintain the form of the first half of the season,” Johnson said.• Rico Henry has had a torrid time with injuries, twice dislocating the same shoulder and undergoing surgery on his right knee, but he scored his first league goal for Brentford last weekend, two and a half years after joining. Dean Smith handed Henry his debut as a 17-year-old at Walsall before bringing him to Brentford in 2016, with the left wing-back signing a five-year contract. The Aston Villa manager, who previously compared the now 21-year-old to Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon, is keen on reuniting with Henry this month. Providing Henry can stay fit, he could feature for England Under-21s at Euro 2019.• Christian Doidge should have been preparing to face West Bromwich Albion this week but, instead, the Welshman will line up against Bury. Back at Forest Green Rovers after a bitter war of words between the Gloucestershire side and Bolton – who loaned Doidge in the summer with an agreement to pay £1m for the striker this month – he will enhance the club’s tilt at promotion. He scored 25 goals last season and four in the first five league matches of this one before departing for Bolton. “He’s devastated because he’s been given Championship football and left with League Two football,” said the Rovers manager, Mark Cooper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b72c43d224fd45bd6e36e032f8bd1564d1406c/0_346_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=320c976b49e5469ef8eab8f30a42a39b","title":"tanzania albinism life beyond stigma and superstition","story":"In a country where myths about albinism can have deadly consequences, an organisation set up to battle discrimination is having a profound impactPaschal Merumba has suffered prejudice from the very day he was born.His mother refused to breastfeed her “cursed” baby, the second child in the family born with albinism the first had already died of neglect. Merumba was thought to have contaminated the community. He was made to eat apart and sleep on the floor.In 2013, Merumba was attacked by men who tried to kill him. “I was out one evening looking for something to eat when I was ambushed by a group of men,” he recalls. “They tied my arms and legs, hooked a rope round my neck, and began pulling me into the bush. They wanted to cut my head off to perform witchcraft.”He was saved when a neighbour ran screaming towards the group with a torch.The health implications of albinism – visual impairment and the risk of skin cancer – are well known. For some, though, social stigma is the biggest danger.“My life was spent in darkness,” says Merumba. “At my lowest point, I drank battery fluid in an effort to end my own life. When it failed, I said to myself: maybe it’s not God’s wish that I leave this world. Not yet.”Now 54, his life changed after a meeting with Alex Magaga, who had worked on a documentary, In the Shadow of the Sun, which tells the story of two Tanzanians with albinism. Its success led director Harry Freeland to set up Standing Voice, an organisation based on Ukerewe, an island in Lake Victoria, that defends the rights of people with albinism. Magaga is now its operations manager and Merumba the site gardener.“Ukerewe Island was home to a deeply impoverished community marked by segregation and violence: siblings forced to eat from separate plates in the belief their albinism was contagious, women raped because of the myth their albinism cured Aids, and those who died of skin cancer but were denied burial because they were ‘ghosts’ whose bodies would disappear,” says Sam Clarke, Standing Voice’s communications manager.The myths and misperceptions surrounding albinism in Tanzania are “almost too numerous to count”, says Clarke. Some believe the body parts of people with albinism bestow good fortune. This, says Clarke, has propelled 206 murders and hundreds of attacks across 28 African countries since 2006. In Tanzania, 75 albinos were killed between 2000 and 2016, according to the UN.The violence, says Clarke, makes for dramatic headlines but fails to tell the full story. “Murders and attacks are really the tip of the iceberg, the most extreme manifestation of a much deeper, much more structural process that damages the welfare of people with albinism across all areas of life.”A cycle of marginalisation and exclusion can impact several generations, says Clarke. “In Tanzania, the dehumanisation of people with albinism means that services aren’t built to meet their needs: discrimination impedes their access to healthcare, restricts opportunities for education and employment, and isolates people with albinism from their families and communities.”Today, Standing Voice – which has been active for five years and supports members of the Ukerewe Albinism Society – aims to reconnect a ided community.“Every day we see how social integration improves health and education, creates jobs, and builds stronger civil support networks to protect people with albinism from future persecution,” says Freeland.One practical step towards this was the establishment, in 2016, of the Umoja training centre on Ukerewe. Umoja, which means unity in Swahili, offers skills development and economic opportunities to people with albinism and the wider island community a second chance, in effect, for people who have missed out on an education.Last year, Alex Booker, a UK-based printmaker, led woodblock printing. This year, he returned with graphic artist Camille Walala and designer and fabricator Simon Sawyer.The workshops offer a place for the island’s residents to try new things, working alongside one another regardless of the colour of their skin. For those with albinism, it is a chance to build confidence and stronger links with others in the community. Some learn skills that could provide a living.Previous sessions have resulted in ongoing groups for printers, tailors, photographers, performers, young radio reporters and an arts and crafts club.Alongside the classes, Walala, whose dramatic pop designs have earned her the name “queen of colour”, helped to restore the centre.The plan was to add some colour to the buildings, including the water towers, the new radio production lab and the community library. “I wanted people there to feel pride in the centre and the designs,” she says.Walala received many requests to create designs in people’s homes. “They liked the bold graphics with sharp edges, and so we left a lot of tape so that people could practise and create their own designs.”Josephat Thorner, who has albinism and played a prominent role in Freeland’s documentary, took part in the storytelling workshop. “It’s important for us to have this space to understand each other and to share our hopes and ambitions,” he says. “We are here to uplift one another and to develop our talents, to break the silence by speaking back to the world. We are proving to ourselves and each other that we can talk, we can draw, we can learn: we can do whatever we put our minds to in this fight to build an inclusive society.”Vedastus Zangule, who took part in the radio workshops, says he was segregated in primary school because of the colour of his skin: “My teacher either didn’t understand my visual impairment, or he didn’t care. In the end, I was driven out. I stayed at home and taught myself about electronics. I occupied myself by making things, and fixing broken appliances: I was an inventor, a creator. For a long time, I was my only teacher.”Zangule’s aspiration for an education where he would be “respected and included” was fulfilled with support from the project. Now, after being able to complete secondary education, he has a new dream: “I want to go to media school to train to be a TV and radio presenter. I’m a much happier person now.”Life has been transformed for Merumba, too. He feels things are changing for people with albinism on the island. “Where I live now is much safer.

The launch follows the success of the Greggs vegan sausage roll, which has been selling out across the country.Both products aim to capitalise on the rapidly growing numbers of people eating less meat, fish and dairy products. About a third of Britons have stopped or reduced their consumption of meat, while the Veganuary campaign signed up a record 250,000 people in 193 countries this year.People are reducing their consumption of animal products for a variety of reasons, including concerns over their health, animal welfare and the environment. Most people in rich nations eat more meat than is healthy and research indicates that avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact.The Quorn fillets, which will be available in supermarkets from March, give consumers a new alternative to fish. Many of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited and independent research has shown mycoprotein causes lower carbon emissions than farmed fish.The fishless fillets have taken five years to develop, said Geoff Bryant, the technical director at Quorn Foods UK, who added: “The launch marks the logical next step in helping people reduce our reliance on our oceans for protein.”In 2018, the UK launched more vegan food products  than any other nation. The Quorn fillets join a wide range of “faux fish” products on sale in supermarkets, from fishless fingers to vegan versions of tuna, smoked salmon, prawns, scampi, sushi and even caviar. Vegan alternatives to fish, such as “tofish”, have also gone on sale in pubs and chip shops.However, Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, said: “It is perfectly possible to buy and consume fish from sustainable sources. As the International Council for Exploration of the Sea makes clear, all of the main species groups in the north-east Atlantic are not only fished at sustainable levels but are on track to produce high average yields.”Joseph Poore, a food sustainability expert at the University of Oxford, said: “Quorn is leading the market in innovation, and I hope they go further by backing up their sustainability claims with labels on their products spelling out their emissions, impact on bioersity, water and pesticide use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7312b82017c1a1db63ba04b3c0da56628c13276/0_326_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb4fbbe3b87647a5d9bf668ceea06ab","title":"humiliated by british airways staff border checks","story":"I had to fly from London to Lyon to present my master’s degree thesis at the University of Grenoble. I am a Syrian national based in Germany and, to avoid any problems, I checked that my documents were in order on BA’s website and arrived at Heathrow three hours early. However, the BA staff member at the boarding gate was unable to read German or French and refused to accept my documents. She humiliated me in front of other passengers, saying I would not be allowed to board. I eventually found a staff member who confirmed my documents were in order and booked me onto the next flight. I reached Lyon at midnight and missed the connecting bus to Grenoble where I’d prepaid for a hotel room, so I had to spend another €74 on a room at the airport finally reaching Grenoble 14 hours later than planned and on a Sunday when everything was closed. The stress and exhaustion affected my presentation and I did less well then hoped. Your experience is, alas, not uncommon for non-EU passengers. Last October I exposed the plight of travellers, some refugees or immigrants with residency permits, denied boarding because they were wrongly told they needed visas to travel within the European Economic Area (EEA). A little-known consequence of the 1985 Schengen Agreement that abolished border checks was that airlines were effectively substituted as border controllers. They face a fine of between €3,000 (£2,640) and €5,000 if they are found to have flown non-EU nationals with inadequate or forged documentation into the EEA and have to shoulder the cost and responsibility of flying them back to the country they started from.Small wonder, then, airline staff err on the side of caution.After two months you had still received no more than a holding reply from BA. But, under the media spotlight, it has at last stumped up the statutory €250 compensation for denied boarding and a refund for the emergency hotel room. None of which compensates for the humiliation and stress.Although it admits you were incorrectly barred, it admits no fault saying: “We are required to ensure all customers have valid documents for the country of destination … we have apologised for the delay as a result of additional checks.”Caymanian DB was similarly barred by Norwegian Air when trying to fly with her partner and two friends from New York to Paris. She was wrongly told she needed a visa and directed to the French consulate which meant a weekend stay in a New York hotel waiting for it to open. The consulate then confirmed a visa was not required. They then had to pay for new tickets to Paris via London and Eurostar leaving them around £5,000 out of pocket. Only this week, five months after the aborted trip and after the Observer intervened, did Norwegian pay $2,422. It says: “We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and delay caused by incorrect travel eligibility information flagged by a database which is used by airlines across the world. Norwegian has carefully reviewed the circumstances and will reimburse the cost of train travel and fulfil our obligations under EU compensation regulations.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Even after her government had suffered the most humiliating defeat on record, there was only the slightest chink in the prime minister’s denial. After seizing the initiative by volunteering to accept a motion of no confidence the next day and insisting she would listen to parliament and reach out to other parties, Theresa May retreated into her shell. Something would happen sooner or later but she had no idea what. All along, the plan B had been to have no plan B and try to muddle along with plan A. Give May enough time and a version of plan A could even be back on the table.Jeremy Corbyn duly tabled his vote of no confidence and the SNP’s Ian Blackford and Labour’s Yvette Cooper implored the prime minister to extend article 50. May remained impassive, giving nothing away. Almost zen-like. The most painful bit had been the waiting to lose the vote. Sitting and wondering if it would be as bad as she feared. In hindsight, she now regretted delaying the vote as it had rather ruined her Christmas. Now it was over she felt an unexpected serenity. She was still alive. She was still breathing. The country might be in chaos but she felt weirdly OK.Making her closing statement, May had been consumed by fear. She knew she was supposed to be making a rousing last-ditch appeal to parliament, but she’d never been able to lift herself above autopilot. Her delivery was flat and disengaged as she ran through the reasons why parliament should accept her deal for the umpteenth time. It offered certainty. The certainty of defeat. It was the most important vote in MPs’ lives. Until tomorrow’s. Or the day after. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. At times like this, she wondered why she bothered.Then May had known there was to be no salvation from the moment the Speaker had chosen not to allow a vote on the Andrew Murrison amendment that could have minimised the scale of her defeat. As John Bercow made his ruling, the prime minister’s head slumped. There was to be no momentary relief from abject misery. She was stuck in her very public hell.Geoffrey Cox had tried to cheer her up in his opening speech. The attorney general’s last pantomime outing at the dispatch box had attracted mixed reviews and he had received extensive coaching in the interim from the Brian Blessed School of Overacting. But though his technique had improved a little – the voice had a more velvety fruitiness and his arm gestures were more expansive – his material was still desperately thin.We were where we were. Everything that had taken place since 23 June 2016 had been an ineluctable step towards this vote. The backstop was just an airlock: a holding position between two different barometric states. A nano-second’s pause before entering an Albion of hope and dreams. Moreover, expectations of the withdrawal agreement had become wildly inflated. Now was the time for stoical pragmatism. A bad deal was better than a no deal.None of this was really true and Cox knew it. As did MPs from both sides of the house who picked him off at will. We were where we were as a result of the prime minister’s arbitrary red lines and decision to hold an unnecessary election. On the other side of the airlock was a total vacuum. That expectations had been so high was all of the government’s own making. One self-inflicted wound after another.The more Cox’s arguments were dismantled, the more bloated his oratory became. Unable to read his audience, he rattled on for almost exactly an hour allowing himself 10 encores (none of which had been requested). Back at his Devon home, Cox’s dog, Lily, put her paws over her eyes. She had warned him there was a huge gap between am-dram and the professional stage but he hadn’t listened. He had imagined he was giving his finest Henry V and ended up a cross-gartered Malvolio. Still, she had always preferred comedies.With Cox having grabbed so much of the limelight, backbench speeches were soon restricted to five minutes. Bad news for Dominic Raab, who had planned on using his as a leadership bid. No one believes in Dom quite as much as Dom does. Or at all. He has a campaign team of one. Dom has even managed to forget he was Brexit secretary when the withdrawal agreement was being negotiated. From here to obscurity.Thereafter MPs rehashed familiar lines both for and against – mostly against – the withdrawal agreement, while sobbing with tortured self-pity. But no one was listening. They were just waiting to find out what happened next. Come the vote, they were still none the wiser. Except for one thing. Despite a catastrophic defeat, May would survive the no confidence vote. She would remain prime minister. Albeit a prime minister without a clue. A surreal end to a surreal day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc8f92f88b6d6df0042412b837ecd7025c029bfe/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc3824f66605dc0754e5bd824a80a26","title":"brexit front pages on wednesday after may vote defeat","story":"The papers focus on the historic margin of the rejection, while looking ahead to the no-confidence voteThe vote arrived in time for editors to fashion their front pages and the results are not good for Theresa May.The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic. “Brextinct”, is its headline and they have pasted May’s face onto a dodo.

Now it’s time for the MPs to do their duty and work with Theresa May for a deal that satisfies the 17.4m who voted Brexit … Don’t fail us!”Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: “Fighting for her life”.Still keen to show its support for May, the Mail says: “The prime minister called on mutinous Tory MPs to back her in a confidence vote tonight. Another defeat could trigger an election and put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.”The Financial Times’ headline is “May’s Brexit deal crushed by Commons” and its story tries to convey the scale of the defeat, saying “Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the product of two years of torturous negotiations in Brussels, was last night overwhelmingly rejected by the House of Commons.”The i calls the day’s events a “historic humiliation”, pointing out that Tory backbenchers voted “six to one against her Brexit deal” and the Scotsman runs the simple headline “Crushed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/859f1bbb0f39321e98441550b2be4b78304670e2/0_311_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a6361ad1f070d85debfaceb9fa4408","title":"the noes have it insider view mps voted against may brexit deal","story":"MPs broke with protocol to capture the moment as they crowded in to votePhotography is not normally allowed in the ision lobbies where MPs queue to register their votes, but on the occasion of Tuesday’s historic vote – in which Theresa May’s Brexit deal was crushed by 432 votes to 202 – members of the House of Commons were keen to capture the moment.Several tweeted pictures of huddles of MPs crowding the “no” ision.

Tomorrow is shaping up to be another dramatic day in the crazy world that is UK politics, as MPs vote on the no confidence motion proposed by Jeremy Corbyn. We will be back with all the news and updates. I’ll be launching an early-morning blog at about 5:30am, so get some rest, and see you back here in a few hours.As always, thanks for following on.Press Association has this helpful guide to the motion of no-confidence, tabled by Jeremy Corbyn in an attempt to force a general election, which is scheduled to be held tomorrow afternoon.It is the first time the procedure has been used under the provisions of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition government under David Cameron. This is how it will work: Mr Corbyn will move the motion tabled in his name as Leader of the Opposition and will speak first in the debate scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The Prime Minister will then speak for the government and at the end of proceedings at 7pm MPs will vote. If the government wins there will not be a general election and ministers will carry on in office. If the government loses, the Act states there must be an “early” election unless the government can regain the confidence of the House by winning a confidence vote within 14 days. During that two-week period there is no statutory limit on how many times a confidence motion can be brought forward and voted on. In the course of that period the opposition may seek to form alliances within the Commons to demonstrate they are the party most likely to command the confidence of the House and therefore should be given the opportunity to form a government.The front page of the papers are in and they are not good for Theresa May.The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic Sun front page. “Brextinct”, is their headline, as they paste May’s face onto a dodo.“Dismay,” says the Express. “A complete humiliation,” says the . “No deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence,” says the Mirror. Even the Daily Mail, which is usually incredibly supportive of the prime minister, can only muster: “Fighting for her life”.And while we’re on the subject, the agenda for parliamentary business in the House of Commons tomorrow is quite remarkable.Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of “the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union”.This will happen sometime after 12:30pm.Nick Boles, the Conservative MP who has said he will do what it takes to stop a no-deal Brexit, has this dire diagnosis of what went down today.In a long thread, Boles – who earlier today tweeted that someone had threatened to burn down his house – said May “has approached the Brexit negotiation as if she commanded a majority of 150 in the Commons. She has conducted the argument as if this was a party political matter rather than a question of profound national importance of legitimate concern to all MPs.”He urged her to work with opposition MPs to reach a “soft Brexit like that offered by Common Market 2.0 – or what Michel Barnier calls Norway Plus”.Earlier tonight, thousands of people in favour of a second referendum marched on Parliament Square, where they watching the thumping defeat of Theresa May’s deal broadcast on large screens.The former Maryland congressman John Delaney has become the first 2020 presidential candidate to weigh in on Theresa May’s resounding Brexit defeat in parliament on Tuesday.In a statement to the , Delaney, a former businessman and centrist Democrat mounting a dark horse bid for the White House in 2020, said: “The truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now.“Leaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.”Read the full story here:Good evening politics fans, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. After such a dramatic day and with so much about Britain’s future up in the air, I think Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, speaks for us all when she says:Huq has since confirmed the post was “unintentionally tweeted”, but intended or not, it feels like a tweet that speaks to the moment.The chairman and vice chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting Leave Means Leave group, John Longworth and Richard Tice, have released this statement:Quite rightly, MPs have rejected the worst deal in history. The PM should accept this was a bad deal and stick to her words: No deal is better than a bad deal. Let’s go to WTO and save £39billion and be free.The figure they refer to is that which the UK and EU have agreed the former should pay in part in order to honour commitments it made while still a member of the bloc.Earlier, we made brief mention of the reaction of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Here’s his full statement:I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. On the EU side, the process of ratification of the withdrawal agreement continues.The withdrawal agreement is a fair compromise and the best possible deal. It reduces the damage caused by Brexit for citizens and businesses across Europe. It is the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.The risk of a disorderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom has increased with this evening’s vote. While we do not want this to happen, the European commission will continue its contingency work to help ensure the EU is fully prepared.I urge the United Kingdom to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has moved quickly to quell business anger over the failure of May to get the deal ratified.All the main business groups, including the CBI, the British Chambers of Commerce and dozens of chief executives, were on the conference call at 9pm, in which Hammond expressed “disappointment” at the result.One source on the call said it was “constructive” that the “tone was realistic” about the damage this was inflicting on the economy. However, he was hammered by business leaders over parliament’s refusal to take no deal off the table.“This was the single biggest question he was asked,” said the source just hours after the CBI, the BCC, the Institute of Directors and the Federation of Small Businesses called on the government to urgently remove that option for the sake of Britain.Also on the call were the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. A source said:They were also asked about the extension of article 50 but immediately took that out of the conversation by saying that can only happen if we put forward an alternative. The majority of questions were round no deal.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is following the Labour party line that a second referendum should follow any failure to secure a general election:MPs have done the right thing tonight by rejecting the government’s bad Brexit deal. MPs from all political parties realised that this deal would worsen life chances and reduce opportunities for future generations in London and across the UK.What happens next will define our future for decades to come. It is absolutely vital that the prime minister acts immediately to take any prospect of a no-deal Brexit off the table for good. That means withdrawing article 50.We then need a fundamental rethink about how we take this crucial decision. The politicians have failed and, in the absence of a general election, the British public must be allowed to decide what happens next.We’re getting some more reaction to this evening’s vote and where it leaves us from senior figures in Westminster. The Conservative backbencher and former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told BBC Radio 5 Live:It’s a very strange experience to be a backbench MP and participate in a huge rebellion against the government that defeats it by such a substantial margin.But that’s a reflection of the fact that the House of Commons collectively looked at the deal the government has negotiated and concluded that it’s a deal which is not in the national interest.Now that’s not the prime minister’s fault in my view – we would have had a different leader and a different prime minister and we’d have still ended up with the same deal – the problem is the direct result and consequence of the Brexit decision.Any deal, I believe, is going to be an unsatisfactory one as viewed by the Commons. Either my ERG colleagues say that it doesn’t fulfil their dreams of what Brexit was supposed to be about, or people like me look at it and say: ‘But this is a third-rate future for our country and frankly we would be much better staying in’.I have always argued for a further referendum because I believe that it is the only way out and, in doing that, I am respectful of the fact that the electorate might turn around and say: ‘Oh no, we want to leave on the prime minister’s deal’.Many are looking ahead to tomorrow’s debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, following the vote. His party colleague and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has tweeted:Also speaking to 5 Live, the Labour MP, Stephen Doughty, backed a second referendum if the party fails to secure a general election, saying:Labour has a very clear position that was set out in our conference and agreed unanimously by our Labour members and backed by Labour voters as well, which is that we were going to vote down the deal if it didn’t meet the tests, call for a general election and remove the government.If that doesn’t go through, it is very clear that we would have to put this to a public vote.I actually think that is a much bigger thing than Labour policy. I think it’s the right thing to do because ... the reality is that people have changed their minds and have a right in a democracy to look at something, to look at facts and then to make a different decision.And Tory backbencher Paul Scully told the station:Clearly, it didn’t exactly go that well. The only good news is that it didn’t take me that long to vote.At the end of the day, what we need to do now is get through the no-confidence motion tomorrow, which I don’t expect to succeed.The prime minister has said that she’s going to speak to senior parliamentarians, to the DUP, to the Conservative party and see what will fly. Then she needs to go back to the EU and say: ‘Look, see, I told you so. There’s your benchmark, now you’ve got to actually shift’.The problem with speaking to Jeremy Corbyn is that, frankly, if Jeremy Corbyn actually had a plan, given it to the prime minister and put it to a vote, he would have still voted against. That all he is interested in is this general election.As Macron has hinted, however, sympathy among senior political figures on the continent for the view that the EU needs, for its own good, to accommodate the UK’s internal politics may be running short.Prior to the vote, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ chief executive, Mike Hawes, urged MPs to take no-deal off the table. After parliamentarians rejected May’s deal, he added:The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the no-deal cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry.Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk.No-deal must be avoided at all costs.

The pre-school app that helps non-English speakers pick up the foundations of the language is now used by more than 10,000 families in 50 countriesWhen Toby Mather travelled to Russia in 2013 to teach English to primary school children, it was made clear that the school expected results – and fast. But that expectation didn’t match up to the realities of teaching. “Even when you get a really great, passionate teacher, you can’t turn 30 children in a room into great English speakers with just one hour a week. And you especially can’t do it if they’re starting at the age of seven,” he says.The experience inspired Mather to do two things. First, to further indulge his passion and talent for teaching, and second, to give children a foundation in English before they even step into a classroom. “There is a huge drop in a child’s capacity to acquire a second language when they hit six years of age,” he says. “I thought it was a massive shame that they are not starting at the age of, say, four.” But, he needed a solution that was affordable, easy to use, and could be done at home without a private language tutor.When he returned to London, Mather met Adit Trivedi at tech accelerator Entrepreneur First. In 2015, they came up with the idea for Lingumi, an English language learning platform for pre-schoolers, that is now used by more than 10,000 families in 50 countries.Learning English is a long journey for anyone – even native speakers take years to become what Mather describes as “professional”. But children, whose brains are like sponges until they are about six years old, have the ability to pick up a second language – and the confidence to speak it – as if it was their first.Trivedi knows this first-hand – growing up in a non-native English-speaking home, he learned to speak both Gujarati and English. Throughout his life, years would go by when he would speak only English but it would take just hours of being immersed in Gujarati for him to be speaking it conversationally again. Both Trivedi and Mather’s personal insights into how children learn and the impact this can have on them later in life have been a key influence in the development of Lingumi as a platform.Lingumi learning is based on an app, which allows toddlers and their parents to participate in a single 20-minute lesson per day. The children are encouraged to learn natural, spoken English with their parent (rather than reading or writing), where single words are gradually built upon to create more complex phrases over the course of the curriculum.A particular challenge of building the platform has been making sure it’s suitable for its target audience – pre-school-age kids. “How do you resonate language goals in your app to a two- or three-year-old? How do you build something that’s truly fun and engaging, but inevitably and fundamentally teaches English?” says Trivedi.One of the things the pair have kept in mind is that they’re not building a tool for children to become completely fluent in English. Rather, they’re aiming to give them a foundation for when they do start learning the language at school. Mather says giving children these tools can have lifelong benefits.To get the platform to this point, Mather and Trivedi have gone through dozens of iterations, starting with physical products that could be used alongside the app – including a toy cube with characters on each side, who corresponded to the app’s games.“We would even go as far as going to Hyde Park Winter Wonderland for five days straight and literally hustle customers to try and test these products,” says Trivedi. But, in order to integrate voice detection, recording games, and more complex grammar systems, the pair made the difficult decision to abandon the toy and move to a digital-first approach. “It was a bit like using the paint program on an old Windows computer and trying to draw the Mona Lisa,” says Mather.The results for Mather and Trivedi, however, have been even better than expected. “I couldn’t believe how early they started saying words and how native their accents sounded,” says Mather.They both have big ambitions for Lingumi. “It has the technology, the price points, and the value to get to a billion customers,” says Trivedi. While most of the 10,000 to 15,000 users a month are located within Germany, Italy and Taiwan, the next step is pushing Lingumi to the Chinese market. “We’re seeing a spread into new countries: China, France, Spain, South America,” says Trivedi. “Our aim is to create the biggest pre-school education company in the world.”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

Experts share their top tips to improve efficiency and productivityRachael Dines admits she never planned on working for herself, but after being made redundant while pregnant, she began working as a marketing consultant from home. “My husband bought me a laptop and I would literally sit on the sofa and try to run the business,” she says. “That didn’t lead to great productivity. Everything was overlapping with my home life, you’re easily distracted. There are just so many things that can interrupt your day.”Part of the reason for that, Graham Allcott, director at productivity training provider Think Productive, says, may be a misconception around flexible working that’s still evident in some businesses. “I think most companies are still very stuck in this idea that it’s five days a week, 9am-5pm in an office, and you need to be in,” Allcott says.Clare Evans, productivity coach and author of Time Management for Dummies, believes flexible working can really boost morale among the team if the trust is there. “When people work from home, they have much more control over their working hours. Whether they start earlier, finish later, work around family, and other priorities they might have.” For her, it’s important for home workers to have a dedicated space to work from, to have the right technology and to set parameters for the day – including working hours and daily objectives. “Avoid multitasking – focus on one thing at a time,” she says, adding that hanging out washing and other household chores can be left to an appropriate break. She’s also found the Pomodoro technique – breaking work intervals into 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute break, can help maintain focus. “It’s important to take breaks wherever you’re working. Finish one task before getting on with the next one.”Allcott recommends starting the day with some sort of a commute to optimise productivity, even if it’s just walking around the block to buy milk, or taking the dog out. “Get some fresh air and have a transition – you’re getting ready for work, you’re walking to work, now you’re at work,” he says. Most people are at their most attentive in the morning, so this is the best time to address difficult projects, rather than just answering emails that have come in overnight. “The trick is to ignore some of that latest and loudest stuff, and focus on the deeper, more important stuff,” he adds. He’s also found it helps being accountable to someone else, even if it’s just an email you promised to send at a certain time, or a task you had committed to finish on a particular day.After six years of freelancing, Dines launched the marketing and design agency Shake It Up Creative with co-director Meg Fenn in 2015. Though she’s had to make a conscious effort to stay focused while working remotely, she says it has definitely helped make her days more productive. She now leaves the couch for non-work related laptop time, in favour of setting up a proper work space in a separate room, always dresses for work (this might include jeans, but never jogging bottoms or pyjamas) and has become really strict with herself about scheduling her work day. “I definitely work harder now than I did when I was in an office,” she adds.SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

Here they describe their ups and downs, and having their children as chief taste testersOne Saturday morning, when Kevin Bath was having breakfast with his family – wife Kellie and children Evie (12) and Jack (eight) – he casually glanced at the label of the jar of chocolate spread his children were enthusiastically spreading on their toast. He was horrified. The spread contained the equivalent of 57 sugar cubes in a standard jar. Kevin and Kellie decided there must be a healthier option, and the idea for their business, JimJams, was born.Within months the couple had quit their jobs – Kevin, as an IT consultant at the London Stock Exchange and Kellie, who was running her own health business – to focus on their new venture. “We realised there was a gap in the market for a healthy alternative to chocolate spreads,” says Kevin. “Neither of us had any prior experience of the food industry or developing and marketing such a product, but we knew we had to do something. It was a very big leap of faith.”The concept was simple: to develop a chocolate spread with significantly less sugar than the leading brands, but without any compromise on taste. “We had no idea where to start, so we began by contacting manufacturers within the UK and Europe to ask if they would develop a spread for us to sample,” Kellie says. “We held taste-testing sessions around our kitchen table with our friends and family – our kids were chief taste testers – and then took samples to food shows. The feedback enabled us to perfect the final recipe.”The consumer response has been phenomenal, says Kevin. “We appeal mainly to the family market, but we’ve also been attracting younger, more health-conscious consumers. The fact we use a naturally sourced sweetener means it’s kinder on teeth, has less effect on blood glucose levels, contains fewer calories, and is also gluten-free.”Their success, however, has not come easy. “Ignorance, as they say, is bliss, which is just as well, because if we had known just how turbulent the ride was going to be, I’m not sure we would have actually gone for it,” says Kellie. “But I’m so glad we did.”The couple rented a local storage unit and used their personal savings to develop the product, design their branding and tour a few food shows, before the money almost ran out. “We had about four or five months where we didn’t know how we were going to pay the mortgage,” says Kellie. “It was really stressful.”Fortunately, Kevin saw an advertisement for the Grocery Accelerator programme, which invests in new food and drinks brands, and applied for funding. They were shortlisted out of 100 companies and secured investment of £90,000.By that time, they had also found a manufacturer that could deliver, but there were still a number of obstacles to overcome. “They didn’t deal in small product runs. In fact, their minimum order requirement was huge!” Kellie explains. “We had just enough money left to place one order and we only had a handful of potential customers at the time. It was a big risk, but it paid off.”They then approached some local Co-op stores, speciality food stores and independent retailers. It wasn’t long before the business started to take off.“Morrisons was the first supermarket we approached and it was an amazing feeling when they said yes to the product,” says Kevin. “We’d made it simple by offering them a solution – a healthier alternative to a product they were already selling and one that would bring them new customers.”Ocado and Sainsbury’s soon followed, and the couple also recently signed up with the Publix supermarket chain in the US, as well as launching a new 15g portion pot. “The 15g pots are now available in Center Parcs and we have just completed a very successful trial with Hilton Hotels,” says Kellie. “Fingers crossed you will see them in every Hilton very soon. We’re also launching a milk chocolate dipper, and are in final negotiations with a major retailer and Merlin Entertainment.”Despite their success, Kellie says they never stop worrying. “It’s a constant battle. Each time we secure a new retailer, it feels great, but we don’t have time to process it because we’re always moving on to the next thing. We’d get a win and then we’d lose something. We’d think we’d secured something and then the retailer would pull out unexpectedly. So we’re constantly on our toes.”One of the best things about working together and running their own business is, says Kellie, the flexibility is has given them. “I work four days a week, so that I can still be there to help with the children’s homework and catch up with the housework etc,” she says.Kevin says he was usually out the door at 7:30am every morning when he worked in the City but that, since they launched JimJams, he’s able to take his son to football after school each week and be there to do the school run.They hope they are also setting a good example to their children by running their own business. “Jack was with me in Sainsbury’s the other day and he gasped when he saw our spreads on the shelf,” says Kellie. “He asked if he was famous! I would like them to experience running their own business one day, just because it is an amazing way to build self-belief and instils such a strong work ethic. I want them to know that they can achieve anything they set their mind to, and being a role model is the most powerful way to show them it is possible.”Kevin and Kellie are clearly partners in business and in life. “I love the fact that we can celebrate our wins together and we both understand the pressures of the business,” Kellie says. “Some people probably thought we were a bit mad when Kevin left his job in the City to sell chocolate spread, but we hope to prove them wrong.”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

It comes at a time when physicists around the world are considering where to build the next cutting-edge particle collider, with other machines under discussion in Japan and China.Fabiola Gianotti, the director general of Cern, called the latest proposal “a remarkable accomplishment”. “It shows the tremendous potential of the FCC to improve our knowledge of fundamental physics and to advance many technologies with a broad impact on society,” she said.Under the plans, the machine would be built up in stages. At first it would collide electrons and positrons, their positive cousins. Then it would collide electrons with much heavier nuclei of lead atoms. By the late 2050s, it would slam protons together with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts, or nearly 10 times that of the Large Hadron Collider.The subatomic debris thrown out by the collisions could potentially give scientists the chance to study the Higgs particle with unprecedented precision, and create new particles that have so far evaded observation.Peter Higgs predicted the existence of what became known as the Higgs boson in 1964. But the mysterious particle which confers mass on the building blocks of matter was not discovered until 2012 when physicists spotted the telltale signs of its creation in the LHC. The discovery led to the Nobel prize for Peter Higgs the following year.Plans for the FCC, along with other proposals, will now go forward to an international panel of scientists who will consider them as part of a new European strategy for particle physics which is due to be published in 2020.There is no guarantee the machine will be built. In 1993, the US scrapped the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, a machine somewhat smaller than the FCC, after spending $2bn (£1.5bn) on the machine. In December, plans to build a $7bn International Linear Collider in Japan ran into trouble when an influential science committee concluded the cost was too high.Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University, said that the FCC would be unlikely to suffer the same fate as the Superconducting Super Collider. “If the money can be found credibly to start the project, then I am convinced that Cern would build it successfully,” he said.“Ideally an FCC-like project would be a catalyst to found a true world laboratory, which is the obvious next step. After all, Cern is now clearly unofficially the world’s particle physics lab,” Foster added. “This wouldn’t mean that Asian countries or the US would cease to have their own regional programmes: the majority of US physicists are already involved in the LHC.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/311ee685cc4968f9b49a89a250479e5379e765b1/2_54_2709_1626/master/2709.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4660d0467d83ac5035e5f09991bd336d","title":"mara airoldi brexit lost generation public services","story":"We’ve been wasting years trying to design Brexit, at the expense of local government, the NHS and social care, says the thinktank headMara Airoldi is in despair about the state of the UK’s public services. “This will be known as the lost generation, because nothing is happening except Brexit,” says the Oxford-based economist. Airoldi, who holds a master’s degree in decision science, is director of the UK’s Government Outcomes Lab – GO Lab for short – an independent research group funded by Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government and the UK Cabinet Office with the ambitious aim of revolutionising public services.In real life, that means local public services – councils, health bodies, social care providers, police, charities and so on – working together, making better spending decisions to cope with cuts. Airoldi’s team runs regular sessions for local public managers to improve skills in a number of areas, especially project management and decision-making. Trying to make public bodies work together is neither rocket science nor new. Practically everyone involved in UK public service for the past 40 years has pointed out that iding up public money into different departments or silos is a very bad way to cope with issues like obesity or truancy.But change requires backing from central government and recent history is littered with Whitehall’s failed attempts to create more joined-up approaches. While Sure Start and, more recently, projects to join up health and social care have had some success, many more have failed, from Tony Blair’s delivery unit in the early noughties – “targets-led and top-down –” to universal credit and the troubled families programme, which attempted to identify and support 120,000 families that were, in theory, costing the state most to support. A dubious enterprise from the start, it was a project that, according to its final evaluation in 2016, had no discernible impact on the families it was supposed to help.And for all the warm words on prevention, the civil service, local government and the NHS still operate on a model of crisis management, which costs much more than it would to tackle the causes of problems. Now, Airoldi says, Brexit is making it almost impossible for central government to learn anything useful from innovative local projects by councils, the NHS, social care providers, prisons or other public services. “The main worry in my mind is the interruption from Brexit,” she comments. “We need additional social services, and we’ve been wasting years trying to design Brexit.”Councils are being starved of cash, while the underlying factors that create social problems such as obesity, or reoffending, remain unaddressed. “It’s an almost 19th-century situation,” says Airoldi, akin to Victorian London battling disease while leaving the Thames a stinking open sewer. Trying to talk to central government about anything other than the UK’s exit from the EU is, she says, like talking to a mother getting her four children ready for school. “They need to be out of the door and it’s late. She doesn’t have the mental bandwidth to listen. Brexit is creating this distraction and even if you have very capable and brilliant civil servants they don’t have a listening ear.”Even where local experiments have worked, the government has been so narrowly focused on cost that it hasn’t been able to see the true long-term value. In Peterborough, for instance, a five-year project to reduce reoffending rates has had many positive benefits and was described by the then-justice secretary, Chris Grayling, as “encouraging”. But the charities involved were not picked when the scheme was extended nationally – because they were too expensive. “The inability to measure quality is a massive barrier. Central government isn’t gathering, analysing, sharing or guiding learning to build methodically on what is known,” says Airoldi.Ultimately, Airoldi fears for public services, already battered by austerity, in the aftermath of Brexit, particularly if the UK’s GDP takes the kind of hit many predict. “We need some answers,” she says.

It also took 46 weeks – twice the statutory timescale - to complete his education, health and care (EHC) plan, which sets out a child’s legal requirements to additional support.In the second case, the ombudsman said the council had failed to provide a primary school-aged boy with suitable education provision after he was excluded, causing him to miss out on full-time education for eight months.Announcing his judgments in favour of both parents, the ombudsman pointed out that he had upheld nine similar complaints in Norfolk.King said recently: “While our investigations can only provide part of the picture of how the SEN system is functioning – that picture is causing concern. The reality is that some families are suffering a disproportionate burden in having to battle for the support their children are entitled to.”Following the two most recent cases affecting Norfolk, the council agreed to a number of service reviews and improvements, including examining other ways of providing alternative education for children out of school and completing an audit of children missing from education for whom it has a duty to provide education.It has also agreed to review its working processes to ensure EHC plans are produced within statutory timescales and to improve the way it monitors missing professional advice it requires in order to complete the plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89628a7632734ba22226adae806e763aba79a569/4_230_4105_2463/master/4105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dbbfff327d9efcd60c1fcb705e0cdb4","title":"rehab centre learning disabilities secure units community","story":"When Julie Newcombe visited her learning disabled son, Jamie, he was subdued and nursing a swollen arm.Staff at the care unit in the south of England where he had been living for a few weeks said that Jamie, 23, who has autism and intermittent mental health issues, became distressed and hit a care worker. Giving evidence to parliament in December, Newcombe told MPs that his arm was subsequently broken by a support worker in a restraint. “The arm was wrenched up behind his back until the bone snapped,” she said. “He was not taken to accident and emergency for 24 hours even though his arm was completely swollen.”Jamie spent a year in the privately run locked rehabilitation unit in 2015. These units are meant to provide therapeutic care on locked wards in the community, and support people moving from long-term inpatient care into their local area. Before rehab, Jamie was in psychiatric intensive care and then in a hospital-style assessment and treatment unit (ATU), having been sectioned under the mental health act at 18, when his residential care broke down.But Newcombe says Jamie’s care did little to help him live in the community again – and that the rehab activities mainly included being taught to cook and clean. She adds: “I visited every day and was allowed to take Jamie out … we’d go shopping or to the cafe, but inside rehab, he was restrained and locked away.” Newcombe, who co-founded the human rights campaign Rightful Lives to champion the interests of people with learning disabilities and autism, and to highlight cases where they have been breached, says local authorities and clinical commissioning groups use these secure units instead of finding adequate support for people in the community. “Locked rehab is a handy extra step in the system when you want to keep people locked up,” she says. “It’s a tempting alternative to moving people back to the community.”Last week’s NHS long-term plan included a new target to reduce the numbers in ATUs by half compared to 2015 levels (when there were around 3,000 people in such units). After the 2011 Winterbourne View abuse scandal exposed the reality of some ATUs, the government promised to move all inpatients into community-based housing within three years under its transforming care programme. That target was missed.Despite being designed for temporary care and assessment while long-term support is organised, many residents have been there for more than two years. Progress has been slow and latest figures show that 2,350 people still live in ATUs. And the avoidable death of Connor Sparrowhawk in an NHS-run ATU in 2013 underlined the failures in these units.Now, campaigners fear the looming deadline to discharge patients from ATUs, together with a separate government-commissioned review of the use of restraint, prolonged seclusion and segregation for people with mental health problems, a learning disability andor autism, will simply lead to more people being discharged into equally restrictive places such as locked rehab units.Last week, the Commons’ joint committee on human rights quizzed NHS England and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator as part of its inquiry into conditions at learning disability units.NHS Digital figures show increasing numbers of people moving to places classed as “other” types of care(compared with those going to residential or community care, for example). What “other” includes is not defined, raising concerns about what type of care this is.Chris Hatton, professor of public health and disability at Lancaster University, says: “Without transparency, it’s possible to game the statistics to make the ‘transforming care’ numbers look good while consigning people to invisibility in places that feel very similar to inpatient units.”Lib Dem MP and former health minister Norman Lamb says the rush to move people out of ATUs risks creating a revolving door of discharge and readmission. This is because “you discharge people to inappropriate or unacceptable settings that don’t actually enhance their quality of life”.This was the experience of Alexis Quinn. Quinn, who is autistic, spent five months in locked rehab in southern England in 2015 after more than three years in an ATU, psychiatric intensive and acute mental health care. She calls locked rehab “an oxymoron”: “How can you rehabilitate someone into community life when they are locked up?” The CQC has previously warned against the use of locked rehab for mental health patients, while the Royal College of Psychiatrists does not accept it as a type of care. “The facilities appear to be defined by having a locked door rather than the specific type of rehabilitation service they offer,” says Rajesh Mohan, chair of the rehabilitation and social psychiatry faculty at the RCP.Residential homes for learning disabled or autistic people can be just as oppressive. Tom Richardson, 17, (not his real name) has severe learning disabilities and spent 18 months on and off in one ATU in the north of England in his early teens. His initial discharge to a privately run group care home failed as Tom found it overwhelming. After another ATU spell, he went to a small, private care home. He was the sole resident, there was an office by the entrance and some staff wore suits. Tom’s mother, Amy, says: “We were shocked. We felt that the care wasn’t therapeutic but focused on physical restraint and seclusion.”Tom’s experience shows a successful move to the community is possible, but there is an additional concern.While there is a new target to reduce ATU use in the NHS long-term plan, there is nothing to replace the transforming care agenda after March. Steve Scown, chief executive of voluntary sector support provider Dimensions, says: “Without such a central focus, who’s going to make sure we’re not seeing people being transferred into privately owned and managed long-stay institutions?”An NHS England spokeswoman says it is investing £75m to improve specialist community support for learning disabled and autistic people: “Treatment and care reviews are in place to ensure the right care and support is provided to help people live as independently as possible and close to their family and friends.”Back in Surrey, Jamie Newcombe is now living in a flat in a residential care development in Surrey. He is happy, says Julie, although deeply affected by his locked rehab experience: “When he’s anxious or upset, he’ll shout about what happened when his arm was broken.” Eventually, she says, her son hopes to move closer to home in London: “Jamie has a human right to a family life.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c71da89f4291e44246d27aa6969513482aa98fb/0_506_5292_3175/master/5292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ebd9dab847d0367acfeb3c6b39f61ea","title":"cricket vices harder to keep secret","story":"Players have been fighting, drinking and sleeping around for as long as they’ve been batting, bowling and catching but these days you can guarantee everyone will know about itWhenever David Green belched he would say “Boycott!” and since he belched a lot “Boycott” was probably one of the first few words I ever heard him say, followed, in short order, by a philippic against “whichever fucker” had forgotten to replace the cellophane wrap on the tray of sandwiches at the back of the press box, the admonishment of a sloppy piece of outfielding, and a caustic enquiry about whether any of the rest of us could possibly help him solve a cryptic crossword clue which he probably already knew the answer to.Green, who played county cricket for 15 years, and wrote about it for another 30, was one of those characters people worry aren’t around any more. He died in 2016.In 1965, Green scored 2,000 runs and, they say, put away a pint for every one of them. “If ever there was a larger than life character it was Greeny,” said his old Gloucestershire teammate Mike Procter. “Extremely intelligent and witty, he had an old-fashioned attitude to new-fangled things such as training and fitness programmes. He didn’t believe in them. For him, cricket was a way of making a lot of friends, knocking the cover off the ball if possible, and making regular attempts to boost the profit of certain breweries.”I read that quote back to Green once, and he replied “Aye, he’s a fine fucking one to talk” and followed up with an eye-popping anecdote about their adventures together.Green knew a lot of those. Not just about Procter. He cared deeply about the game, but he couldn’t stand cant, and used to take great pleasure in disabusing all the rest of us of our romantic ideas about some of the men who played it. He horrified the biographer of one well-known cricketer by insisting that his idol had only ever walked when it suited him. Which is one of the few tales he had that are fit for publication. Green was a raconteur, with a repertoire of sordid stories about the stuff some of our heroes used to get up to at night-time. It was quite an education for a kid who had learned most of what he knew about the game back then by reading Wisden.All that came back to me on Monday when Tom Harrison, the CEO of the England and Wales Cricket Board, was talking through what the board are planning to do in reaction to the recent disciplinary cases involving Ben Stokes and Alex Hales – who, as you already know if you’ve read this far, were both fined over their involvement in a fight – and Joe Clarke and Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who have just been dropped from the England Lions squad after it was revealed that they were involved in a WhatsApp chat group that recorded sexual conquests. I guess Green wouldn’t have approved, but I know he wouldn’t have been surprised.Harrison was asked whether the ECB’s sponsors were worried about the damage these cases had done to the reputation of the game. Yes, he said, they are. “The reason why commercial partners get involved in some cases is because the culture beneath your game is something that attracts people,” Harrison said. “What cricket means to people, beyond the performance of the England teams, or the performance of the county teams, is this underlying sense of decency. The spirit that is associated with the game is a hugely important part of it.” Really, though, that decency is a bit of a myth. Players have been fighting, drinking and sleeping around for as long as they’ve been batting, bowling and catching.Harrison touched on that himself. “These are societal trends, in some cases, that are coming into the game, and perhaps have been there for a long time but are coming to the surface,” he said. Then in his next breath he added: “It’s our responsibility as a governing body of the game to get on the front foot by addressing these issues whether they’re with problem gambling, whether they’re about drink, whether they’re about consent, whether they’re about recreational drug use. Whatever it is, these are issues that are pervading society now in a way that perhaps they weren’t 20, 25 years ago.”It’s not that the vices have grown any more common now than they used to be, of course an hour listening to David Green talk about the old days would have taught anyone that much.It’s just that it’s a lot harder for the players to keep them secret. Back when Green was playing, and long after he’d finished for that matter, journalists used to protect the players they were on tour with. They say that all changed in the late 80s, when Ian Botham became such a draw that newspapers started sending news journalists on tour. Since then, the development of social media and the spread of smartphones has meant that everything changed all over again.And standards are different now, too. The “societal trend” Harrison mentioned is not that people are misbehaving more now, but that everyone else is forgiving them less.Expectations have changed, thank God. Which is why Harrison was right to promise that the ECB, together with the Professional Cricketers’ Association, are going to redouble their efforts again this season “to make sure that those messages are renewed and updated”. Players are as flawed and fallible as they always were, only now they can’t afford to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6027867c16c41a1108a27e97d81ad8a8851200c/6_153_3978_2386/master/3978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca500dd25540469c82d942bc8b500034","title":"joe root ben stokes jonny bairstow england presidents xi","story":"At the leafy and sedate Three Ws Oval in Bridgetown, England’s cricketers blew off the cobwebs from a near two-month international break with the first hit of their all-important 2019.Preparation for next Wednesday’s first Test against West Indies consists of back-to-back two-day games against a President’s XI. In the first of them Joe Root led the way, the Test captain shrugging off a disappointing recent spell in Australia’s Big Bash League with a run-a-ball 87 as his side made 317 runs for the loss of 10 wickets.Having registered three Ws in Sri Lanka in November, Root spent the festive break at Sydney Thunder in pursuit of the Twenty20 experience the packed schedule rarely affords him. The Yorkshireman never got going, however, and a top score of 26 from seven innings followed.But back in the whites of England his game appeared unaffected, as he creamed 12 fours and two sixes in a largely frictionless workout before a top-edged sweep made him the first of five wickets for the spinner Bryan Charles. Ben Stokes, who conversely took up the scheduled downtime, also spent two hours and 20 minutes at the crease for 56 from 97 balls.Though in keeping with the modern trend of tour games that resemble extended middle practice, two Test-capped bowlers in Miguel Cummins and Alzarri Joseph and a pitch offering variable bounce early on made it a handy refresher against seam given the dominance of spin in the Sri Lanka series.The tourists, who left out Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid from that series win, had gone into the match with 12 players and the intention of batting all day regardless. This came to pass as the lazy sun slunk towards the Caribbean sea, Keaton Jennings emerging for a second innings of the day – having been caught at short leg for 10 during the morning session – and making an unbeaten 15.Rory Burns had looked the more assured opener with 35 from 70 balls, adapting to what he described as a “tacky surface” first thing. While eventually lbw after lunch to Chemar Holder, ending a stand of 72 with Root, the left-hander had been suitably watchful, clipping runs off his hips and occasionally unfurling drives either through cover or straight.While Burns, Root and Stokes enjoyed decent time in the middle – as did Moeen Ali, who batted an hour for his 21 runs before an ugly heave off Charles – others missed out. Jonny Bairstow, in at No 3, earlier fell for four, caught behind attempting an expansive drive, having looked as scratchy as the family of chickens loitering around the Malcolm Marshall nets all day. Ben Foakes and Sam Curran failed too – both nicking off to Holder – as England technically lost their last five wickets for 46 runs.Chris Woakes, joined by Jennings before the close, ploughed on for a typically dutiful 37 not out. Wickets may be his main currency but his runs are certainly handy. Given Buttler, the vice-captain, is a definite starter next week, and Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are expected to resume their new ball partnership, the Warwickshire all-rounder is hoping to avoid being one of two that must make way from this 12.West Indies will be trimming down from a squad of 13 players (plus one reserve), having shown their hand for the first Test and given Darren Bravo, the talented but unfulfilled left-hander who once drew comparisons with Brian Lara, a first call-up for two years.The 29-year-old recently returned to first-class cricket with Trinidad and Tobago – his Test exile was initially sparked by calling the West Indies board president Dave Cameron a “big idiot” in a tweet back in 2016 – and he joins the uncapped pair of John Campbell and Shamarh Brooks in a batting lineup reshuffled after a 2-0 defeat in Bangladesh.West Indies squad Jason Holder (capt), Kraigg Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Shamarh Brooks, John Campbell, Roston Chase, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Shimron Hetmyer, Shai Hope, Alzarri Joseph, Kemar Roach, Jomel Warrican, Oshane Thomas (cover for Joseph)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d0c7269f7e07caa7da721ad84c1f5aa25b51f7/0_64_4037_2423/master/4037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a6992094bedd863df762c4e885c8f4","title":"dan evans emerges from australian open defeat to roger federer with great credit","story":"Dan Evans will surely never play at such an excellent level as this for so long on a major stage, and lose – except, probably, if the opponent is Roger Federer again.On day three of the Australian Open, Evans pushed the defending champion to the limits of his genius – reminiscent of the Briton’s fine losing effort against Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2016 US Open – before Federer got it done in just over two and a half hours, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.The winner said courtside: “I couldn’t pull away early in the match, which was to his credit. I thought I played well. The margins are slim if you don’t win those close points.”In reference to the similarities in their method and tennis philosophy, from the one-handed backhands to the sliced returns, as well as their willingness to attack at every opportunity, Federer added: “It felt like playing in a mirror a little bit. That was the mindset I had – how would I play myself potentially. I had maybe a little more size.”If it were boxing, this second-round contest would have been lauded as perfect match-making between the intuitive shotmaker from Solihull – responding to Brummie-tinged calls of “Come on, Peaky” – and the ageless Swiss, who is hunting down his 100th tournament victory.Evans still has not taken a set off Federer in three matches but, in front of a full house in the Rod Laver Arena, he came desperately close.In the first set, he gave an excellent account of himself, with minor distractions. He overcame a minor hiccup at 30-all on his serve in the eighth game, when a Federer forehand seemed to drift long but was not called as he had been in mid-shot, there was no review. But Evans held, pumping his fist, clearly happy to be trading on level terms with the owner of 20 majors, six of them here, and four of those since he turned 30.The disparity in court intelligence was not blindingly apparent, as the Birmingham player went at Federer with his full bag of tricks, chipping and slicing with precision. The Swiss answered him in kind, only with more practised ease.Federer, serving at 40-15 in the ninth game, paused as the rain spat, resuming after five minutes to hold. Evans came from 15-30 on his serve to stay in the set, still looking comfortable at this level. An appalling late call on Evans’s overcooked forehand in the 12th game gave Federer set point, but Evans conjured a wonderful fightback to force the tie-break.Trusting his attacking instincts, he was two points from taking the set, when he raced in too eagerly behind his serve, dumping a difficult volley from near his toes, then shoved another on the run into the tramlines to hand Federer two set points. Evans’s final backhand inched long, and, after an hour of superb tennis, Federer was mightily relieved.While Federer remained his calm self, Evans faltered, broken at the start of the first set. He pushed Federer to break point in the next game with a string of wonderful shots, but could not quite crack the Swiss vault.When Evans gestured to the umpire that he had felt another drop of rain, they paused, but the roof remained open. “It’s all right, I’ll be the one running,” Evans shouted to Federer, who smiled at the suggestion the danger on a slippery court would belong to his opponent, while he serenely directed traffic from the other end.He did – but not all the time. Evans saved two set points for 4-5, blitzed a backhand past his devil-may-care opponent to break back, but Federer’s serve was too strong in the second shootout.Not many expected Evans to create a British fixtures clash, though, and he was still giving Federer quality grief after two and a quarter hours as Leicester’s Katie Boulter was beginning her second-round match against the formidable Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka on Melbourne Arena.While Evans’s noble resistance began to crumble under the sustained pressure of Federer’s searching groundstrokes and solid serve in the third set, he fought hard all the way to the end. And he clearly enjoyed the experience, smiling to his box when a favourite piece of music flooded the arena during one changeover break.From 4-1 down, Evans clawed his way back to 5-2, held and forced Federer to serve it out, which the defending champion did to love, finishing with a flourish, a delightful backhand down the line.Boulter also produced a highly creditable performance in defeat. The 22-year-old, who is making her Australian Open debut and pulled off a big win over Ekaterina Makarova on Monday, matched Sabalenka, the 11th seed, for much of their match before going down 6-3, 6-4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/088fab69a5b91176d53fe38819bd86a7e090d15d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e632ba1b078136c07f9f8a6fbc56535a","title":"rafael nadal angelique kerber maria sharapova australian open live","story":"• Follow the night-time action on day three at Melbourne Park• Konta fired up for Muguruza clash as Serena eases through• Kyrgios outplayed by Raonic in straight-sets defeat• Email Jacob or tweet @JacobSteinbergSure enough, Rafa Nadal breaks, capitalising on double-faults from Matthew Ebden. He’ll serve for the first set at 5-3. As for Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed has finally seen off Pablo Cuevas, beating the Uruguayan 6-3, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5.You have to take your hat off to John Millman, who’s only gone and forced that fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut on Hisense Arena. Bautista Agut had match points in the tie-break, but Millman’s digging ridiculously deep and has sent the home fans wild as he threatens to win from two sets down. Meanwhile Alex de Minaur has been taken to a fourth set by Henri Laaksonen, who saved a match point before winning the third-set tie-break.Matthew Ebden is giving Rafa Nadal a few early problems on Rod Laver Arena. He’s showing no fear and a fizzing forehand down the line earns him a break point at 3-3. Yet Nadal is strong enough the net to force deuce. Ebden earns another chance and he plays the rally magnificently - until he nets a backhand volley with Nadal stranded. Eventually Nadal holds to lead 4-3. Ebden might look back at that volley and wonder.Having served for the fourth set at 5-4, now John Millman’s having to deal with the disappointment of being broken. Roberto Bautista Agut will fancy his chances of getting this done without having to go through a fifth set.We’ve got three Aussie men in action now. Matthew Ebden’s just held his opening service game against Rafa Nadal on Rod Laver Arena, Alex de Minaur’s two sets up and battling hard in the third against Henri Laaksonen, and John Millman is threatening to force a fifth set against Roberto Bautista Agut, who’s having flashbacks to his dramatic tussle with Andy Murray on Monday.On Rod Laver Arena, they’ve just said hello to Rafael Nadal and Matthew Ebden. Nadal has won his only previous meeting with the world No48.Grigor Dimitrov, the 20th seed, has a grip on proceedings on Court 3 again. He leads 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Alex de Minaur, he’s two sets up against Henri Laaksonen - though the Swiss qualifier leads 4-1 in the third set.Maia sends one final forehand wide and Kerber, who looks totally dialled in, celebrates with the look of someone who’s pleased to have got the job done with such efficiency. The former champion moves on to play the Australian qualifier Kimberly Birrell, who stunned Croatia’s Donna Vekic earlier.Angelique Kerber will serve for the match. She breaks when Beatriz Haddad Maia knocks a forehand wide. It’s 6-2, 5-3 to the No2 seed.Alex de Minaur is serving for a two-set lead against Henri Laaksonen. Elsewhere Grigor Dimitrov has established a measure of control against Pablo Cuevas, breaking to lead in 6-3, 6-7, 3-1.There’s hope yet for John Millman on Hisense Arena! The Australian’s only gone and taken the third set to lift home hopes, though Roberto Bautista still leads 6-3, 6-1, 3-6.Grigor Dimitrov has been dragged into a battle by Pablo Cuevas, who’s levelled it up on Court 3 after snatching the second set on a tie-break. You don’t want to rely on Grigor too much. It’s never a wise move.After 47 minutes, Angelique Kerber yelps “Come on!” as she clenches her fist and walks back to her chair with the first set in the bag. The second seed took it 6-2, which makes it look easy, though she has been inconvenienced here and there by Beatriz Haddad Maia, the Brazilian qualifier. Maia’s determined not to roll over. Alex de Minaur, who could play Rafael Nadal in the third round, is a set up against Henri Laaksonen. The young Australian took it 6-4.While I was distracted by a long chat with the football editor here, Belinda Bencic went and pulled off a remarkable turnaround in the third set against Yulia Putintseva on Court 20. She was a break down but the Swiss has ended up winning 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. Bencic will play Petra Kvitova next – the Czech had an easy win over Irina-Camelia Begu.Angelique Kerber’s having little trouble dealing with her Brazilian opponent so far. The German already has an early break on Rod Laver Arena – a few nice touches from Beatriz Haddad Maia haven’t been enough to make an impact so far.Just to put Andy Murray’s five-set defeat to Roberto Bautista Agut in context, the Spaniard leads 6-3, 5-0 against John Millman. Meanwhile Yulia Putintseva is threatening to pull off a very impressive comeback against Belinda Bencic – after losing the first set to the Swiss, the Kazakh has an early break in the decider.The first set belongs to Grigor Dimitrov on Court 3. He took it 6-3 against Pablo Cuevas. As for Petra Kvitova, she remains in control against Irina-Camelia Begu, who’ll do well to fight back from a set and a break down.They’re out on the two main courts. Angelique Kerber, the No2 seed and 2016 champion, meets Beatriz Haddad Maia on Rod Laver Arena, while Alex de Minaur is up against Henri Laaksonen on Margaret Court Arena. De Minaur, seeded 27th, could go deep here. Big things are expected from the young Australian.Roberto Bautista Agut, conqueror of Andy Murray in the first round, is breaking hearts again. This time the 22nd seed’s foiling a home hopeful on Hisense Arena, taking the first set 6-3 off John Millman.No problems for Petra Kvitova so far. The former Wimbledon champion’s taken the first set 6-1 against the outgunned Irina-Camelia Begu, who can’t live with her opponent’s raw power.In fast start news, Grigor Dimitrov leads 3-0 in the first set against Pablo Cuevas. You’ll note that Dimitrov, a semi-finalist in 2017, is the 20th seed this year. The Bulgarian was meant to produce so much more after winning the ATP World Tour Finals two seasons ago, but it’s still not really happening for him. First-round defeats to Stan Wawrinka at Wimbledon and the US Open last year were hugely disappointing. At the age of 27, we’re no longer talking about a guy with potential.It’s a demolition so far. Petra Kvitova earns three break points and her venomous forehand gives her a 4-0 lead. She’s hitting it so hard. Begu can’t live with it at all.Petra Kvitova’s got her eye in early on. She’s broken already against Irina-Camelia Begu and her movement looks spot on, which is always a good sign for the Czech.Over on Court 20, Belinda Bencic has snatched the first set 7-5 off Yulia Putintseva. Meanwhile Petra Kvitova and Irina-Camelia Begu are underway.Roger Federer’s third round opponent? It’s Taylor Fritz, who’s just secured a very good win over Gael Monils, the 30th seed. The young American took it 6-3, 6-7 (8), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (5). Fine margins. It was more comfortable for Karen Khachanov, the powerful young Russian winning in three sets against Yoshihito Nishioka. The 10th seed has never been in the third round here before.There’s no shame in losing this one for Boulter. It’s not a drubbing – but Sabalenka, two years younger than Boulter, is on a different level. The Belarusian is through to the third round and her power will make her a serious threat.Another Brit bit the dust earlier today, though Dan Evans emerged with plenty of credit after an entertaining battle with Roger Federer, who plays Gael Monfils or Taylor Fritz next. Fans on Rod Laver Arena have also seen Sloane Stephens beat Timea Babos and Ashleigh Barty beat Wang Yafan. One of the more eye-catching results on day three, meanwhile, is the USA’s Frances Tiafoe beating the No5 seed Kevin Anderson in four sets. That’s a top win for the highly rated American youngster. Marin Cilic is also through to the third round after beating Mackenzie McDonald, while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Victor Troicki in four.Elsewhere Caroline Wozniacki has cruised into round three, beating Sweden’s Johanna Larsson 6-1, 6-3. The defending champion will play Maria Sharapova or Rebecca Peterson next.Speaking of British tennis, it’s over to Melbourne Arena, where Katie Boulter’s in action against Aryna Sabalenka, the brilliant Belarusian. However it isn’t going to well for Boulter. The 22-year-old from Leicester lost the first set 6-3 and finds herself a break down deep in the second.Our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell, has been nattering with Jamie Murray.Hello and welcome to live coverage of the night session on day three of the Australian Open. The main event - assuming we aren’t just going to watch a stroll - is Rafael Nadal taking on Australia’s Matthew Ebden, who’ll have plenty of home support on Rod Laver Arena. All that shouting might not be enough, though. That’s the last match of the day on that court.Elsewhere in the men’s second round, Aussies will be more hopeful when they watch their rising wonderkid, Alex de Minaur, take on Henri Laaksonen. John Millman, who beat Roger Federer at last year’s US Open, is also in action – he plays the 22nd seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, who beat Andy Murray in five sets on Monday. Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov against Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas is another one to look out for.As for the women, we have the Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber up first on Rod Laver Arena. The German meets Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil and will expect to win comfortably. Whether the same can be said of Maria Sharapova is less certain, though - the former champion had a good win over Harriet Dart on Monday, but she’s looked past her peak in the past two years and could have to work hard against Sweden’s Rebecca Peterson. Elsewhere we have Petra Kvitova versus Irina-Camelia Begu. That’s enough to be getting on with, isn’t it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7aa55a18c77c1109ea8aea034f8f18a965acab2/0_352_2138_1282/master/2138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d88b063f03c605b30dfa2f5804fdc88","title":"carol channing broadway and film star with a husky comic drawl","story":"Channing, who has died aged 97, starred in Hello Dolly! and Thoroughly Modern Millie, and had a genius for characterThornton Wilder, having seen Carol Channing in Hello Dolly!, the 1964 Broadway musical adapted from his play The Matchmaker, proposed rewriting his peculiar 1942 success The Skin of Our Teeth. His idea was that Channing could play the maid, Sabina (who is also a vamp), while doubling as the everywoman housewife Mrs Antrobus. It was her voice he wanted, the way it could flip from husk to squeak to a honk so basso that it became a plot point in the 1967 film Thoroughly Modern Millie, in which Channing starred opposite Julie Andrews.Channing had her own number in Millie: Jazz Baby, a 1919 hit that opens “My daddy was a ragtime trombone player”, which perfectly showcased her genius for the comedy slide – a gift of her vocal range – and even more her delivery. Listen to her stretch and rasp the “a” and the “zz” in “jazz”, a vocalisation so wild that the film’s scriptwriters gave her the word “raspberry” as a dialogue keynote – she drawls it across many frames.You wonder what 1940s Broadway made of Channing, who wasn’t going to turn out a steam-powered belter in the manner of Ethel Merman, real-homespun like Mary Martin or cool-funny like Eve Arden, whom she understudied. (All three later took stints as post-Channing Dollies.) Her lollipop head and muscular arms were unusual for the period, as was her voice for Broadway, with its often black-edged styling – one of Channing’s grandmothers was African American, although the influence was more perhaps her favourite performers, especially Ethel Waters’s mix of sexuality with energetic absurdity.She was a character-player trying for lead roles. In her first Broadway success, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), she used the comedy of her growled vowels to keep her jazz age gold-digger (well, diamond-collector) Lorelei Lee on the sweet side of sleaze. If sugar daddies happened by, it wasn’t the fault of just a little girl from Little Rock. Playing Dolly, she barely descended into boom, even in When the Parade Passes By, written for Merman-level foghorn delivery. Channing, instead, worked a sadness in her husky middle voice.Want a real treat? Listen to Channing as Mehitabel the Shinbone Alley cat, muse to Eddie Bracken’s Archy the poetic cockroach, on a 1954 musical concept LP take on the writings of the humourist Don Marquis, titled Archy and Mehitabel. Her mog enters to muted trumpet with a honky-tonk intonation she trumpets herself with a nasal jazz delivery when Archy thwarts her intention that her kittens should drown. But also: “I’m a lady still” she purrs, then miaows “Toujours gai.” What a one-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e8a3f5deb92fea615d89cf238d4e81c7fa10d2/0_80_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cf68c05850febad01e80fd685664685","title":"passage review mark paul gosselaar saniyya sidney justin cronin vaccine","story":"The hunt is on to create a super-vaccine to save humanity from a vampiric vaccine-gone-wrong in this credible, pacy take on Justin Cronin’s bestsellerHow wise dear Blaise Pascal was when he wrote: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” If only the good doctors in the opening scenes of this adaptation of Justin Cronin’s bestseller The Passage (Fox) had imbibed his words before they went spelunking for vampires.That’s your mistake, you see. If you hear rumour of a 250-year-old man surviving in a Bolivian cave, just … leave it. No good can come, y’know?Best friends Dr Jonas Lear (desirous of a cure for his wife’s early-onset dementia) and Dr Tim Fanning (desirous of the dollars that would come from using an immortal’s blood to develop a vaccine for all known diseases) find their guy. He, alas, is desirous of sinking his teeth into Dr Fanning’s veiny, venal neck and duly does so, turning Fanning (Jamie McShane) into Patient Zero for a vampiric virus that carries the potential to save mankind from all the ills living flesh is heir to. Don’t look too hard at the science. It’s not what we’re here for.Within a few years, a secret medical facility has acquired a bunkerful of human guinea pigs who, as part of “Project Noah”, have traded life on death row for life as a potentially immortal lab rat (sorry – the Figures of Speech shop had a twofer on rodent metaphors). A dozen of them have ended up in a human-vampire limbo. Stuck in their cells with nothing but thrice-daily meals at the blood trough to distract them, they communicate telepathically and invade the dreams of the staff who attend them.So far, this show does exactly what every ounce of its opening scene’s script, premise, direction, acting and bloody convulsions promised, which is deliver a daft story at pace and slightly but distinctly better than needed. There is no nobler creative pursuit and no greater viewing pleasure. You can smell when the slightest contempt has crept in to the making of any genre piece – be it book, film or TV – and it kills any chance of success on contact. The Passage smells great.Research has stalled – their vampire-derived proto-vaccine creates pan-immunity but eventually attacks the neurons and reduces the subjects to living deadness – just as an avian flu pandemic threatens to wipe out (and neither I nor the cast can emphasise this enough) All of Humanity. The pressure mounts to find this access-all-areas vaccine. What to do, what to do?! They must find a child, because children have lots more neurons than grownups and so will survive the immunisation process! Will it proof them against starvation when all the flu-ridden adults around them are heaped corpses, asks nobody because we must get on with the show.Ex-special forces – yesssss! – federal agent Brad Wolgast is a tough guy (three tours, a silver heart and 98 kills in Afghanistan, in case you were contemplating doubt), but when he is told to kidnap 10-year-old Amy (too recently orphaned to be in the system and leave a pesky paper trail behind her – this show thinks of everything so you don’t have to! Except for science), he turns out to have a soft heart. They go on the lam together instead. He is trying to atone for the death of his 10-year-old daughter, for which he feels responsible. We know he is not because a) his loving ex-wife insists that he’s not and b) he is played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar who has a perennially lovely face and ineradicable, emphatically non-child-death-causing vibe. We leave them at the end of the episode with Brad wounded in a shoot-out, still determined to see Amy to safety but aware that the net is closing in.The developing father-daughter bond between Brad and Amy (a performance by 12-year-old Saniyya Sidney that belies her years and the fact that her character description for such a sturdy workhorse of a production surely comprised two words at most: “Sassy, scrappy”) transcends the nonsense and pulls it all together. Sidney and Gosselaar have real chemistry, sparking and bantering but nailing their (unsentimental) emotional moments as they grieve their losses. They lift the credibility of the whole thing, and are far better than they need to be.My fear that the US has its own secret bunkers in every state where child actors are taken and trained to elite standards as Soviet Russia used to train its juvenile mathematicians, however, grows apace.

Schellenberg’s lawyer has said his client plans to appeal.If the appeal is rejected, then the court’s verdict will go to the supreme people’s court in Beijing. If they approve it, the execution could happen within seven days, but the court could also reduce the sentence.Relations between the two countries – which only months before had been in pursuit of a large free trade agreement – turned icy in early December when Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei executive and Chinese citizen, for extradition to the US.On Tuesday, hours after Ottawa issued a travel warning for Canadians in China, Beijing published a similar advisory telling its citizens to “fully evaluate the risks” of traveling in Canada and detailed the “arbitrary detention” of a Chinese national.Chinese state media have defended their government’s actions and penalties for drug smugglers. A Xinhua-affiliated editor posted on his public Wechat account: “Indeed, those who commit sins should not survive. When it comes to drug traffickers, no matter where you come from there is bound to be a bullet waiting for you!”Critics say Beijing is using Schellenberg’s case to exert pressure on Ottawa. But analysts have been confounded by the dramatic deterioration in relations.“I’m mystified by the lack of restraint in the Chinese response. It’s not what I would expect to have from such a serious strategic country, and the Chinese are highly strategic,” said Michael Byers, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia. “In this instance it seems that are allowing anger to get the better of their strategic foresight.”While China has been vocal about Canada’s arrest of Meng on 1 December, Trudeau’s comments in recent days have also been “unhelpful”, said Byers.“He suggested a few days ago that one of the Canadians who has been detained has diplomatic immunity, which is patently false,” he said, adding that Trudeau’s comments that Schellenberg’s detention was “arbitrary” did little to remedy a fraught situation. “This public posturing on both sides is therefore misguided by both governments.”Domestically, Trudeau has faced growing criticism from opposition parties for his reluctance to speak directly with Chinese president Xi Jinping.Said Byers: “I think the avoidance of direct leader-to-leader is a good policy. We have diplomats for a reason and our embassy enables us to communicate messages – outside of the public spotlight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2be613a0125924416739610de02967d5088e8ff/0_142_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18ef2b54a7e6294d7235a2fb97496e8a","title":"el chapo trial 100m bribe former mexican president pena nieto witness","story":"Alex Cifuentes, a close associate of the cartel chief, testified that he told US authorities about the alleged bribe in 2016A witness at the US trial of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has testified that he told US authorities the accused Mexican drug lord once paid a $100m bribe to the former Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto.Alex Cifuentes, who has said he was a close associate of the Sinaloa cartel chief for years, discussed the alleged bribe under cross-examination by one of Guzman’s lawyers in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday. Asked if he told authorities in 2016 that Guzmán arranged the bribe, he answered: “That’s right.”Peña Nieto was president of Mexico from December 2012 until November 2018. He previously served as governor of the state of Mexico.The former president made no immediate comment on the allegation. His former spokesman and other former officials did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment.Guzmán, 61, has been on trial in federal court in Brooklyn since November. He was extradited to the United States in 2017 to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs into the country as leader of the cartel.At the start of the trial in November, defence attorney Jeffrey Lichtman alleged on behalf of his client that that Mexican officials – including Peña Nieto and his predecessor – had received bribes to protect Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, another reputed trafficker who is still at large.At the time, a spokesman for Peña Nieto called the allegation “false and defamatory”, while his predecessor Felipe Calderón tweeted that the remarks were “absolutely false and reckless”.The judge in the case, Brian Cogan admonished Lichtman for having gone “far afield of direct or circumstantial proof”. He said he would instruct the jury to focus on the evidence.At the end of the first week of trial, Guzmán’s lawyers told the judge that a witness would describe a payment to an “incumbent” Mexican president.He was stopped from doing so by a prosecutors’ motion, upheld by Judge Cogan, “protecting iniduals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b19847d29f9105ee85d6f1b3a883b0eb0147864/0_181_5435_3261/master/5435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47002620c52a70b3dc1dec8e03af8ce6","title":"germans take to the streets to celebrate rosa luxemburg karl liebknecht berlin","story":"Leftwingers commemorate 100th anniversary of murder of the communist writer, pacifist and radical inspiration Negar Mohseni clutched a red carnation and waited patiently under cold, drizzly skies as the queue slowly snaked its way towards the grave of Rosa Luxemburg. “I simply want to pay my respects,” said the 54-year-old Iranian. “Besides, she gives me the strength and motivation to continue to believe in the fight for social justice.”A thick carpet of red blooms smothered the grave of the early 20th-century revolutionary leader and that of her fellow leftist agitator Karl Liebknecht at the Friedrichsfelde central cemetery in eastern Berlin. Both were murdered at the age of 47 on 15 January 100 years ago. Someone had left a note in a shaky hand that read “Peace, bread, roses, freedom”. People wiped away tears as they laid their flowers.The anniversary of the state-sanctioned murders of the founders of the Communist party of Germany (KPD) brought an estimated 20,000 people on to the streets of Berlin at the weekend for a march that marked the high point of a series of commemorative events, including theatre performances, readings and new biographies.Although Liebknecht is held in high regard, it is Luxemburg who has been stealing the limelight. Not least, according to Mark Jones – assistant professor at University College Dublin and a leading expert on the German revolution of 1918-19 that culminated in the murders – because “she was a high achiever who rose in the very male-dominated world of Social Democratic politics”.She was considered a great orator and a prolific writer, cherished today by her leftwing supporters due to her opposition to the first world war and her fight for the rights of the working class, as well as the fact that her early death meant her reputation was not blemished by later disillusionments with the communist dream. Her name retains its popularity as a choice for her supporters’ female offspring.Luxemburg’s slogans, along with portraits of her and Liebknecht, were held high on the red banners clutched by people as they made their way along the former Stalin Allee in eastern Berlin on Sunday, with hearty renditions of the Internationale and other revolutionary songs blaring out of portable speakers.“Of course, the brutal and sudden end to her story raises the question of what would have happened if she had survived,” said Jones. “At its most advanced and powerful, the Rosa Luxemburg myth claims that had she lived, National Socialism may have never taken control of Germany.”That was a view held by many at the demonstration. “I do believe the Nazis might not have come to power and history might well have taken a different turn had Rosa been able to fulfil her wishes,” said Kit Aastrup, a retired social worker who had taken a bus from Aarhus in Denmark to join the march. She wore a Russian ushanka ear-flap hat, embossed with a hammer and sickle. A group calling themselves the “Yellow Vests”, a nod to France’s gilet jaunes movement, held a banner across the width of the street that read: “Remembering Karl and Rosa in 2019 means showing solidarity with the ‘yellow vests’.”Uwe Hiksch, a member of the opposition Die Linke, or Left party, which sees itself as the natural inheritor of Luxemburg’s legacy, guides tourists around the Berlin landmarks connected to the murders. A recent tour took in the site of Eden, the hotel where Luxemburg and Liebknecht were brought by demobilised former soldiers, known as Freikorps to be beaten and shot. It continues to the location where Luxemburg’s body was thrown into the canal, and, a few hundred metres away, the Neuen See lake where Liebknecht was shot and killed.When the Freikorps came to arrest her, Luxemburg was reading Goethe’s Faust. “She thought she was going to be taken to prison, she had no idea she was going to be murdered, so she brought a suitcase of books with her,” Hiksch said.Far from uniting Germany’s left, the murders created a deep ide, still felt keenly today in the animosities that exist between the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior coalition partner to Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats, and Die Linke, successors to the communist party that ruled East Germany.Recently, Andrea Nahles became the first leader of the SPD to come close to admitting her party’s role in the revolutionaries’ deaths, amid evidence that Gustav Noske, the minister of defence in the SPD-led fledgling Weimar government at the time, effectively signed off on the murders in an effort to crush the far left.“It is probable that Gustav Noske had a hand in the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,” she told the party faithful in November at an event to discuss the 1919 revolt.Noske was later involved in the farcical trials that followed the murders and that led to the acquittal of all but two of the suspects, who received paltry sentences.“The SPD has a very difficult relationship with the 1918-19 revolution,” said Jones. “While various party historians openly admit the SPD’s role in the events, others still want to defend it.”Even now, he said, Die Linke supporters argued that just as the SPD betrayed the working class then, so it continued to do with its labour reforms, seen as punishing the working class.The London writer David Fernbach was among those who came to Berlin to pay tribute to Luxemburg and Liebknecht. His grandfather, Wolfgang, was a member of the Spartacus League, the Marxist revolutionary movement founded by Luxemburg and Liebknecht in reaction to the SPD’s support for the first world war. Wolfgang was murdered by government troops on 11 January 1919, when he was 30.“Luxemburg made a huge contribution to the positive sides of German socialism at a time when it was free from the dogmatisms that were to follow, which is why I think she remains something of an untainted socialist icon today,” Fernbach said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dbee4dac49766bf01ac8d53e593a76a849ab209/0_69_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ca700ed992b29d5a4ebcfeaadad898","title":"toto africa desert installation play for all eternity","story":"Namibian-German artist Max Siedentopf set up an installation of six speakers that play Africa by Toto on an infinite loop in an undisclosed spot Somewhere amid the sand dunes of the world’s oldest desert croons a soft voice: “It’s gonna take a lot to take me away from you.”The voice belongs to the American band Toto, whose hit song Africa has been indefinitely tethered to an undisclosed spot in the Namib coastal desert thanks to Namibian-German artist Max Siedentopf.The artist set up an installation called Toto Forever made up of six speakers attached to a blue MP3 player – whose only song is Africa set to play on an infinite loop – all standing atop white rectangular blocks set up in the sand. The installation, Siedentopf writes on his website, runs on solar batteries “to keep Toto going for all eternity”.The song was released in 1982, but it has been dubbed “the internet’s favorite song” with hundreds of thousands of fans across the web. The music video has 442m views on YouTube, while Spotify said that Africa plays doubled in 2018 compared with the previous year. A bot on Twitter that is dedicated to tweeting out the song’s lyrics has well over 50,000 followers. Weezer made a cover of the song last year, and Pitbull’s sampling of the song was featured on the Aquaman soundtrack. Even scientists have joked it is the best song ever made.Though Africa is named after the continent, the song has turned more into a soothing anthem for Americans that speaks to the ideals of Africa. Jeff Porcaro, the late co-writer of the song and drummer for Toto, described the idea of the song as “a white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he’s never been there, he can only tell what he’s seen on TV or remembers in the past”.Siedentopf said he considers the tribute worthwhile because Toto has “made a song that is understood and liked all over the world”, he wrote to the . He considers any reaction to the installation, even negative ones, a compliment.“If no one hates it, no one will love it,” Siedentopf wrote. “I think having the worst sound installation is more interesting than just a mediocre installation.”The artist has included a rather unhelpful map on his website, which has the entire 1,200-mile Namib desert circled in red that indicates the location of the installation. Siedentopf seems to have purposely made it hard to find – for fans and authorities alike.“I’m not too worried that someone will put it in jeopardy,” Siedentopf wrote. “Finding it might take some time.”True fans may just have to listen for the voice of Toto to find the installation in the vast desert.

The prime minister is to begin urgent cross-party talks about a new approach but has not said what this might involve. Jeremy Corbyn will table his no-confidence motion in the government, due to be voted on this evening. The backing of both the DUP and Tory MPs means May is almost certain to win and, unable to secure a general election, Corbyn will face intense pressure to commit Labour to supporting a second referendum. The Tory MP Dominic Grieve will present two bills to the House seeking a people’s vote. Our live coverage of another dramatic day is under way. So far the markets have been subdued and the pound is expected to remain volatile.Both Brexiters and pro-Europeans are treating the vote as a victory but there is no consensus about its impact. Campaigners for a second referendum are thrilled because they believe it is now more likely. But as May put it: “It is clear that the house does not support this deal, but tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.” In her statement to MPs after the result, May implied that she was leaning towards a Norway-style soft Brexit by saying she wanted “constructive” talks with Labour MPs. But she also said any proposals must be “genuinely negotiable” and she was committed to delivering on the result of the referendum. Her cabinet is deeply ided on the idea of a softer Brexit, and her party split between dealers and no-dealers. Our editorial argues the PM has no option but to reach across party lines. Jonathan Freedland laments “the sight of a parliament paralysed by indecision … and the spectacle of a country lost and adrift”.Nairobi attack – Gunfire and explosions have been heard at a Nairobi hotel complex more than 16 hours after Islamist extremist gunmen launched an attack that is thought to have killed at least 15 people, including a US citizen, in the Kenyan capital. A security source in Nairobi said the operation was “slow and cautious” because of fears that attackers were wearing suicide belts. The interior minister, Fred Matiang’i, had earlier said security forces had secured all of the buildings affected. The attack was claimed by al-Shabaab, the militant Islamist organisation based in neighbouring Somalia.Midweek catch-up – Some of the other things going on …\u0026gt The school inspections system is to have its biggest overhaul in decades.

Angus Macpherson, the Wiltshire police commissioner, said: “He will be given all the support he needs.”\u0026gt The New Zealander charged with murdering British backpacker Grace Millane has pleaded not guilty. The accused, a man aged 27, has been remanded in custody to next appear in court in April.\u0026gt Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, who fled to Thailand from her Saudi family and won asylum in Canada, has pledged to “work in support of freedom for women around the world”.Christie throws book at Kushner – Chris Christie, who was ousted as chairman of Donald Trump’s White House transition team in 2016, has accused Jared Kushner of carrying out a political “hit job” because Christie prosecuted his father, Charles Kushner, a decade ago. In his soon to be published book Let Me Finish, the former New Jersey governor also writes that the president propelled to fame by the catchphrase “You’re fired” seldom does the deed himself. He got Steve Bannon to deliver the message to Christie and later told him: “Chris, you didn’t get fired. You got made part of a larger team.”Soft rock in a hot place – An artist has left an MP3 player and speakers in the Namibian desert that crank out Toto’s 1982 hit song Africa on an infinite loop. Max Siedentopf, who is Namibian-German, added solar batteries to keep the mellow vibes going day and night at the secret location. “Finding it might take some time,” says Siedentopf, who said the installation was a tribute to “a song that is understood and liked all over the world”. If that’s not enough zen, here is a giant floating disc of ice spinning gracefully to remind you there is unexpected beauty to be found in the world.On a monumental day in parliament, Anushka Asthana is with the Conservative MP Anna Soubry as she works across traditional party boundaries to defeat Theresa May’s Brexit deal.

That is our focus. Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal,” said Ms Foster.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar must ensure that the backstop is maintained. “The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and our partners at a European level need to stand firm and not move away from or attempt to dilute the backstop,” she said.“We need to say clearly to the British that if they wish to Brexit then that’s a matter for themselves but any Brexit agreement needs to recognise, understand and protect the people, the economy and the peace process on this island,” added Ms McDonald.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “naive belief in Westminster that a better deal can be negotiated with Brussels is merely postponing the inevitable”. “The fact remains - there is no way to avoid a hard border in Ireland if Northern Ireland leaves the customs union and single market. That is why a backstop is essential,” he said. “Northern Ireland’s economy and stability can’t be sacrificed because politicians in London have failed to recognise the obvious,” added Mr Eastwood.The Ulster Unionist Party MEP Jim Nicholson said the reaction of Brussels to the vote would be extremely important and “now is the opportunity to fix the backstop”.“If we can fix the withdrawal agreement and in particular the backstop, we avoid the no deal outcome which would have serious consequences for both the United Kingdom and the European Union,” he said. “Brussels has the room and ability to manoeuvre. It is time for the EU to reflect on this vote, show maturity, and find a better agreement that can be accepted by a majority in the House of Commons and ensure we leave the European Union with a good deal,” added Mr Nicholson.Alliance Leader Naomi Long said there was “no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit” and now was the time for a “people’s vote” on the UK exiting the EU.“Democracy is an active process, and given what we now know and the ongoing deadlock, the people of UK must have the right to have their say,” she said. The Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said the “treacherous deal” got “its just deserts”. “It deserved no better. PM needs to present EU choice of ditch the backstop or face no deal. No more rollover,” he tweeted. The leader of the Greens in Northern Ireland Clare Bailey said it was now time for a “people’s vote” and that the “option to remain must be on the table”.The DUP leader Ms Foster when earlier confirming that the party’s 10 MPs would vote against the withdrawal agreement repeated that the backstop was unnecessary and that the “borders of the past were there for a completely different reason”. “They were there to stop terrorists, they were there to stop the flow of Semtex as opposed to the flow of powdered milk,” she said.This prompted SDLP border MLA Justin McNulty to respond that “long before the Troubles broke out, there was a customs border”. “A border existed since partition and it existed primarily as a customs border. It sought to prevent the carrying of goods across the border without paying excise duty. It was only in the 1970s the militarised border appeared and this lasted for over thirty years,” he added. “The people of Ireland, North and South, do not want to go back to any form of border on this island. Mrs Foster and her colleagues have blindly followed the rightwing pied pipers Jacob Reese Mogg, David Davis and Boris Johnston into a Brexit cul-de-sac,” said Mr McNulty.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit – one as important to the EU as major crossing points in Eastern Europe.The 1998 Belfast Agreement – better known internationally as the Good Friday Agreement – laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions.Neither side, to be fair, wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace, with fears that a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remained fully aligned with the European Union’s customs union and part of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick, too, to EU rules covering state aids and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, initially insisted that this so-called backstop could only apply in Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applied to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected.Under British prime minister Theresa May’s current plan, the backstop would apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, the current proposal is still strongly opposed by the DUP and many hard Brexiteers.Everyone involved – Brussels, Dublin, May – has insisted again and again that the backstop is an insurance policy, one that no one wants to use.Instead, they emphasise that it would only apply if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, these assurances have not dampened down opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Despite what some in the United Kingdom believe now, the warnings about the implications that Brexit could have on the Border were given before UK voters went to the polls in June 2016, not least by the then taoiseach Enda Kenny in London in January 2016 after a meeting in Downing Street with David Cameron.“From our perspective it would create serious difficulties for Northern Ireland and I don’t want to see that happening,” Mr Kenny declared later, speaking to journalists.Immediately, Mr Kenny was criticised by the Democratic Unionist Party and by some in the Conservative party, with DUP MP Sammy Wilson saying that Mr Kenny had been recruited by Mr Cameron to spread the “scare tactics of the pro-Europe camp in the United Kingdom”.Days before the referendum, Mr Kenny returned again to London. Before doing so, he warned that he could not see any way in which the introduction of border checks could be avoided if the UK voted to leave.“Were that to happen, obviously it means paperwork, it means administration, it means lost time, it means greater inefficiency, it means greater cost.“It would not be the wish of the Irish Government that there would be a restoration of customs and border controls, but that would not be in our capacity not to have it,” he warned.Now one of the key questions is what happens if the withdrawal agreement is not finalised and there is a no-deal Brexit. No side wants to impose border checks, but to avoid smuggling and protect the EU single market, the Irish Government would come under pressure to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed ? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The tranistion is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May has faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbsp Many Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its Article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Liam McBurney for The .The hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland during the Troubles only came about as a result of Republicans’ actions, DUP MP and Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson has claimed. Mr Wilson said “the only hard border we ever had in Northern Ireland was a hard border which resulted from the actions of Republicans”. He made the comments after his party leader Arlene Foster claimed there had never been a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Wilson said Republicans “were the ones who caused army checkpoints to be put in place, army patrols, watch towers.”Tens of thousands of British army troops failed to secure a hard border, he said, questioning “how on earth” the European Union would be able to do so in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Ms Foster had said there was no need for a backstop - the name given to the legal guarantee that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a deal - and that there would be no return to a hard border in Ireland. The backstop has been a major point of contention, with hardline Brexiteers and the DUP opposing the clause.“As someone who lived through the Troubles, we never had a hard border,” Ms Foster said. “There were 20,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland and they couldn’t hermetically seal the border in Northern Ireland, so it is a bit of a nonsense frankly to talk about a hard border .”When challenged by a journalist that during the Troubles there was routine checks along border crossings, Ms Foster said: “I think you’ll accept it was for reasons of security and even then terrorists were able to come and go at their pleasure.”The DUP and a large number of Conservative MPs in the House of Commons voted against Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal on Tuesday as it was beaten by 432 votes to 202. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would table a motion of no-confidence in the Government, which will be debated on Wednesday afternoon before a vote is held at 7pm. However, DUP MPs, who are in a confidence and supply deal with the prime minister, and hardline Brexiteers who voted against the proposed deal are expected to support the government in the no-confidence vote. Commenting on the fallout of Tuesday night’s vote, Mr Wilson said he did not think Mrs May could command enough support in parliament to extend the UK’s departure date from the EU, currently set for March 29th. “A no deal Brexit will happen once we reach the 29th March, legally we will have left and if there’s no deal, then we have no deal. I don’t fear it,” Mr Wilson said. Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the onus was on the British government to propose a viable alternative to the withdrawal agreement.He told the same programme that the Government would not block any request from the UK for more time to come up with a Brexit deal, but there needs to be a plan for a “managed, controlled Brexit”.“There’s still a lot to happen in Westminster before it becomes clear what the UK is looking for,” he said. “We need to hold our nerve.”Mr Coveney added: “I don’t think the EU is any mood to agree changes to the withdrawal treaty.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireFor strong leadership in times of great national crisis, when the people cry out for courage, inspiration and a doughty bulldog spirit, one name comes to mind. He wasn’t in the Dáil for the first sitting of the new session, which was a worry. Brexit had reached a critical point. People could talk of little else. Think of little else. They feared their heads might explode. Kildare Street was on lockdown. Metal barriers at both ends creating a no man’s land of road and pavement, alongside a set of barricades at either side of Leinster House and the road opposite. Protesters were reportedly on the way. Things could get nasty.“I think they’re the Irish Jilly Juns,” said a helpful garda. “They don’t believe Leo Varadkar should be Taoiseach.”And into this turmoil, this vortex of conflict and worry, barrelled the TDs, back from their Christmas break. At least they had the strength to return. The Senators, who are very emotional and sensitive creatures, were able to follow the twists and turns of Tuesday’s Brexit melodrama from the muzzy warmth of their safe spaces, or second jobs. A sign on one of the monitors in the Dáil chamber explained their absence: “Seanad Éireann resumes on Tuesday 22nd January at 2.30pm.”Could things get any worse? Hordes threatening to storm the gates. No Senators. A gathering Brexit shambles posing grave danger to innocent Ireland. The Taoiseach and the leader of the Opposition discussing whether the country should stockpile vital medicines. Outlining how to strengthen transport links. Talking about the introduction of emergency legislation. Briefing party leaders with the details later in the day. Anything that needs to be done in the event of a difficult Brexit will be done, assured Leo Varadkar. If financial measures are needed, so be it. He said the Minister for Finance has “special powers” in this regard. SuperPaschal. He’ll be delighted.Such excitement. Such tension. Such drama. And at this historic, daunting, dangerous juncture, no Winston Churchtown, aka Shane Ross, in the Dáil chamber. A mere child is in charge. Leo Varadkar is 40 on Friday. “We agreed we would put all the necessary legislation relating to Brexit into one large, omnibus Brexit Bill, with 17 different parts to it, that is, effectively 17 pieces of legislation in one, covering a number of different areas.”Suddenly, we had the explanation for the absence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism, Hockey, Stepaside, Judicial Appointments and Knocking on Constituents’ Doors on Christmas Eve.He had work to do, for he is the Minister for Omnibuses. And Leo is putting every bit of legislation to do with Brexit into “one, large omnibus”. Cometh the hour, cometh Winston Churchtown. We’ll be grand. Ooh, who are we trying to fool? The first day back was awful. Outside, nothing happened. It was just as dull inside. But we can’t blame the TDs this time. When the only game in town is not in your town, it is difficult to concentrate on local contests. Kildare Street was irrelevant on Tuesday. Westminster and Theresa May’s doomed “Meaningful Vote” was where it was at. Everyone knew her withdrawal agreement with the EU was doomed, but the hype and hysteria surrounding it was irresistible. The unfolding political pantomime across the pond induced a thrilling pit-of-the-stomach dread in transfixed Irish bystanders, who thought nothing could move them after two years of watching their neighbours losing the plot.A humdrum Dáil session couldn’t compete with the crackling political excitement of Westminster. No kind of homegrown meaningful could match the shenanigans of May’s Meaningful Vote.Serious issues were raised during Leaders’ Questions, but there was little engagement in the chamber. Instead, there was a sense of marking time until some semblance of something emerged from London. There was a row over Dáil speaking time and arguments over when the Dáil should hold its latest Brexit debate. Not soon enough, reckoned Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin. Catherine Murphy had pertinent questions to ask about the spiralling cost of the new children’s hospital. Never mind the “cost”, argued the Taoiseach, think of the “value”.Murphy said that, while she sincerely hoped she was wrong, something being the most expensive did not automatically make it the best. How come other countries in Europe can build similar hospitals without huge budget overruns?As Leaders’ Questions slid slowly into Questions on Promised Legislation, TDs slid out of the chamber, or slid ever more deeply into their mobile phones. At one point, we counted 18 of the 26 Fianna Fáil TDs present flicking away on their handsets.The Rural Alliance, along with a couple of rural-based Fianna Fáilers, decided to go to town on the Taoiseach for remarks he made on Monday about trying to eat less red meat. How dare he tell people to eat less meat, with the beef farmers of the country on their uppers and worrying about live exports post-Brexit. “Very, very hurtful,” sighed Michael Healy-Rae.Varadkar protested that he didn’t tell anyone to steer clear of any steers. He was only speaking for himself and his resolution to eat more healthily while also being more climate-aware.The good news is that he had a lovely steak for dinner the other night. No point in going all sensible now, while he’s still young. And to emphasise the point, as everyone else was going doolally over Mrs May’s crushing Meaningful Vote defeat, Leo was enjoying a meaningful dinner with his Independent Alliance Government partners. Probably with a stirring address on the Omnibus situation from Winston Churchtown for afters."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3759831.1547634165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu ready to discuss new brexit deal if uk changes red lines","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier speaks during a debate on Brexit at the European Parliament on Wednesday morning.

Photograph: Jean-Francois BadiasAP. The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator has told the United Kingdom that it could have a different kind of departure deal if London is willing to change its key demands. Mr Barnier warned that the risk of a disorderly withdrawal was now greater than ever as a result of the vote and that the EU would step up its preparations amid concern a no-deal outcome could disrupt the whole of Europe. He indicated that one way forward would be for Britain to accept even closer alignment with EU regulations to secure a very close trading relationship in future. EU officials say London could, for example, abandon its determination to leave the EU customs union and the centrally regulated single market.Referring to statements by the European Parliament and all the other member states, Mr Barnier said: “If the United Kingdom chooses to let its red lines change in future, and that it takes this choice for its advantage of the ambition of going beyond a simple but not negligible free trade accord, then the European Union would be ready immediately to ... respond favourably.”That suggestion for a “deeper relationship” was echoed by the EU parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt. Mr Barnier and others lined up to highlight how the vote in London exposed only isions, without shedding light on what Britain’s could actually rally behind as a consensual position, just 10 weeks before it is set to leave the bloc, potentially into a legal limbo for citizens and businesses.“Please, please, please tell us finally what you want to achieve,” pleaded Manfred Weber, the centre-right leader in the parliament and an ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel.But, he added, there was “no room for manoeuvre” in terms of renegotiating the current agreement, which Brexit campaigners say leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, especially due to a “backstop” insurance clause intended to avoid throwing up a hard customs border across Ireland. Mr Barnier insisted there could be no weakening on that issue.“Right now it’s too early to assess all the consequences of this vote,” he told a Strasbourg chamber that was sparsely attended for the early morning debate, perhaps reflecting a growing weariness in Europe with Britain’s troubles.“We have respected and we continue to respect the democratic parliamentary debate in the UK and I will not speculate on the different scenarios. What yesterday’s vote showed is that the political conditions for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement are not yet there in London.”Some EU politicians have called for Britain to put the question of remaining in the EU to a second referendum. The chair of EU summits, Donald Tusk, suggested on Tuesday that ision in Britain could lead to Brexit being cancelled.Frans Timmermans, the deputy head of the European Commission, citing a phrase often attributed to British fantasy novelist C.S. Lewis, suggested Britain should put its past tribulations behind it and seek a fresh start with the EU:“You can’t go back and change the beginning,” the former Dutch foreign minister said, “But you can start where you are and change the ending.”But Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party which drove the campaign for the 2016 vote to leave, told fellow members of the European Parliament that any second ballot would deliver an even greater majority for quitting because Britons had been angered by the EU’s stance in negotiations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

A sign nearby reads “Keeping Britain Trading”.Barron is concerned about the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on Britain’s ability to do just that at the busy port, a hub for freight traffic from Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. But he’s not concerned enough to change his mind. He says he voted to leave after a terrorist attack made him question immigration.“It made me think, hang on, I don’t want all these North Africans coming in through Europe, and I still don’t.” Which attack? Manchester, he says immediately. In reality, the attack at the Ariana Grande concert happened a year after the Brexit vote. There’s been “too much scaremongering”, he adds, but he’s talking about trade, not terrorism. “At the end of the day, people still want to buy products from the UK and products from Europe, so there’s still going to be that interaction.”Brexit is more complex than he realised, and he has sympathy for Theresa May, but doesn’t know what people expected with a Remainer in charge of the negotiations. Whatever happens now, he still wants out. “I haven’t swung to the other side.”Steve Petherbridge, who is here to have his truck washed, hasn’t changed his mind either. Like most people I speak to, he is impatient with the protracted negotiations. “They’re saying now we’ll stop in. We can’t stop in. We voted out, and deal or no deal, we’ll stop out.”Nearby, two Hungarian truck drivers are having lunch in the front of a cab. They are wary about talking, and don’t want to give names. “Brexit was a joke,” one says.Will a no-deal Brexit make their lives more difficult? “Actually nobody knows.” At the moment, one of the men says, there are not enough people manning the UK customs posts, and he doesn’t know where they’re going to recruit additional workers from. But he drives an ambient food truck, and long delays at the ports would be disastrous.In 2016, slightly more than two in three of this city’s 260,000 residents voted to leave the EU. More recent opinion polls seemed to suggest a shift in public mood. According to polls by the pro-referendum group Best for Britain last year, the constituency of Hull North is now 60 per cent Remain, a swing from 52 per cent Leave Hull West and Hessle, which was 67 per cent Leave, is now 54 per cent Leave. But if the people of Hull and the surrounding towns are suffering Leavers’ remorse, they’re not admitting to it.Kingston-upon-Hull, you quickly learn, is a place that defies easy categorisation. It has the dubious title of being the second most-bombed town in England during the second World War, when 90 per cent of its buildings were destroyed, and it still bears the scars. Here and there, examples of the remaining 10 per cent stand, relics of Victorian quaintness that are incongruous among the block modern shopping centres and offices. It is a once-thriving fishing port, which still hasn’t recovered its mojo after the industry declined in the 1970s – something for which many hold the EU responsible. It is also, however, the proud winner of the title of the UK’s capital of culture for 2017.The attitudes to Brexit are as hard to pin down as everything else about Hull.Anne Gorman from Galway, who has lived just outside Hull for 16 years in total and works in the National Health Service, loves the city for its warmth, sense of community and resilience. She voted Remain, and believes the referendum result here was a pushback by a community that felt left behind. “There is an objection to the large number of non-nationals that have come into the city over the last five years or so, but the main reason is the old guard feel neglected,” she says.Amid all the anti-immigrant sentiment from Brexiters, nobody answered the question of who will do the unskilled jobs that the English workforce don’t want to do. “There isn’t exactly a long queue of kids coming out of secondary school who want to go pulling the vegetables out of the field in Lincolnshire.”Outside the job centre, not everyone has heard of Brexit. “Brexit? Something to do with Europe, was it?” one young woman with a stroller says.Gary Ferrerby pulls up on his motorbike emblazoned with L plates. He reels off the reasons he voted Leave: because of immigration because he doesn’t trust politicians because “this country has gone downhill since we went in the EU” and because “it’s costing 20 odd million a day to stay in the EU”.Another man wearing a Hull City football club hat draws a link between Brexit and “the IRA bombing McDonalds and places because they wanted independence, and now they’re getting independence, they say they don’t want it”.Confusion about Ireland’s relationship with Britain and how it might be impacted by Brexit is widespread. Down at the port, Petherbridge reassures me that I shouldn’t worry, “nowt will change in Ireland. The British soldiers will still be there.”Later, in a taxi between Hull and the prosperous town of Beverley, about eight miles away, the driver, Nigel, voted in favour of leaving, and feels let down by politicians and the media. He admits he doesn’t really get the fuss about a hard border. “We’re all coming out, what difference does it make?” He is astonished to hear Ireland is not leaving the EU. “Why are southern Ireland stopping in the EU? Why are they not going with England?”Some of the confusion may be attributable to the fact that Hull has an Irish community that is tiny, and typically quite transient. A small cohort commute here to work weekly, flying in on red-eye flights on noisy turbo-prop planes via Leeds, and home again on Thursday or Friday.One of the fly-in, fly-out workforce is Dr John Byrne, who is in healthcare. Byrne says people in this part of the UK, “other than political anoraks”, are not energised about, or even aware of, the backstop issue. UK politicians, he says, have been guilty of not understanding what their constituents were thinking. The referendum vote was “a kicking”.But he thinks the chance of a no-deal Brexit is receding, particularly as people get immersed in contingency planning and the implications become all too real. “Apart from hardline Brexiters, nobody really wants a no-deal Brexit.”Peter Bartlett, a mechanical engineer from Leixlip who commutes to Hull to work on a construction project, is not convinced Brexit is going to happen at all. He’s so unconvinced, in fact, that he hasn’t bothered to apply for an Irish passport. He was born in England and still uses an English one. “They’ll get to the crux, and then they’ll back down. My prediction is that they’ll stay in the EU.”Eight miles north, in Beverley – a place of more obvious charms than its larger neighbour, including redbrick streetscapes and picturesque tea rooms – few people share Bartlett’s conviction. “We voted out to stay out,” says Simon Foster, out shopping with his girlfriend, Gloria Ashun. Neither of them actually voted, he clarifies. But if there was a second referendum, they would vote to leave. They want “out, even if there’s no deal”.They don’t talk about it with their friends, all in their 20s, anymore. “It’s been two years, or three years nearly. We’re sick of it,” says Ashun.Further along the street, Pip Seminara is returning home from having her hair cut. With an Italian last name, and three children who have plans to travel, her position is complicated.When Brexit happened, she had just bought a house and was worried about house prices, “so I very selfishly voted Remain. But when the Leave vote came in, I was pleased. I didn’t realise much how on the edge I was. I wanted to leave because I thought it was a really good opportunity . . . to make England great for Britain’s sake.”Her preference for Leave wasn’t about immigration. “We’re not trying to pull our drawbridge up, we just want to manage our own affairs, thank you.”Britain pays more than the other countries, she says. “No wonder they’re so pissed off we’re leaving – they’re going to lose our money.”She believes that if Britain goes, it will pave the way for other EU countries, like France, to leave. She is not convinced Britain will leave, but even if it stays, she thinks the EU will take “a hard look at itself . . . It’s an opportunity to kick them up the butt and say what kind of EU do we want.”But the Irish Border issue “is a huge risk. I’d never like to see a hard border in Ireland: the logistics of it, the money we’d have to put into it. It’s too sensitive.”Another man stops to share his view on why Britain must leave, with or without a deal. If Europe had been left as a common market, it would have been fine. “But the idiots over in Brussels tried to dictate our laws.”The woman with him doesn’t want to stop. “You’ve said too much. You’ve got verbal diarrhoea,” she says. Exasperated, as he keeps talking, she turns to me. “Why, if you’re from Ireland, are you here?”He has a last word before he allows her to pull him away. “I won’t trust the EU as far as I can throw them.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence voteWhat \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKSyrian Kurds reject Turkey\u0026#39s plan for \u0026#39safe zone\u0026#39 How Theresa May\u0026#39s desperate bid to save her deal failed amid Brexiteer fears a softer Brexit is now inevitableComment: There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being \u0026#39half-in, half-out\u0026#39 of the EU - just like the British public voted Comment: May running down the clock means we either get a softer Brexit - or none at allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence voteWhat \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKSyrian Kurds reject Turkey\u0026#39s plan for \u0026#39safe zone\u0026#39 How Theresa May\u0026#39s desperate bid to save her deal failed amid Brexiteer fears a softer Brexit is now inevitableComment: There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being \u0026#39half-in, half-out\u0026#39 of the EU - just like the British public voted Comment: May running down the clock means we either get a softer Brexit - or none at allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

He denies the allegations.  Oliver Jarvis, 35, denies the allegations against himMr Cain told the court: I wanted to turn my boat around to leave, but I had only turned 90 degrees when the ferry hit me.That\u0027s the point things changed, I realised I was in quite a dangerous position. I could hear a lot of engine noise and a lot of churning water and I was in a hole between two boats.I basically fought for my life to get out of there. I took physical action, trying to fend his ferry off, I physically pushed it away.That was the only defence I had at the time. It had a small impact, enough for me to drop my engine into the water and get it started.”His hand was all the while being crushed between the ferry and his engine, but he managed to wriggle it free and was hit again as he tried to open up the throttle, the court was told.Stuart Cain said he feared for his life after being hit by the ferry“Because I was under power I basically shot out the back,” he said.It was an instinctive reaction but I think that\u0027s probably what saved my life.The Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the prosecuting agency, said the episode lasted between 10 and 15 seconds.The court heard Mr Cain\u0027s small boat weighed just 170lbs and can carry three people. The Maid of Poole weighs 118 tonnes and can carry 186 passengers.Mr Cain, who wore a cast on his hand for five weeks, alleges that Jarvis left the ferry without checking on his well being.Brexit latest news: Article 50 \u0026#39will not be extended\u0026#39 as Theresa May set to win no confidence voteWhat \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKSyrian Kurds reject Turkey\u0026#39s plan for \u0026#39safe zone\u0026#39 How Theresa May\u0026#39s desperate bid to save her deal failed amid Brexiteer fears a softer Brexit is now inevitableComment: There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being \u0026#39half-in, half-out\u0026#39 of the EU - just like the British public voted Comment: May running down the clock means we either get a softer Brexit - or none at allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

wireless charging mat was widely anticipated to be rolled out at Apple’s iPhone launch last September but the event\u0026nbsppassed without a single mention of the oval-shaped device.Apple has instead had to rely on third-party companies like Belkin to make charging stations for the iPhone X, iPhone Xs and other products with wireless charging capabilities.The big selling point for Apple’s AirPower mat is its ability to charge up to three different products at the same time.AirPower wireless charger is displayed along with other products during an Apple launch event in Cupertino, California (Reuters)It is the difficulty of engineering a\u0026nbspmat\u0026nbspcapable of charging multiple devices at once that has led to delays in the production, according to some industry insiders.Notorious Apple leaker Sonny Dickson previously said the issues with the charging mat included overheating and interference.There is still no word on when the release date or price for the AirPower\u0026nbspcharging mat will be, though unofficial Apple news site MacRumors\u0026nbspsaid it expected it to be early in the first quarter of 2019.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe

At last, the endless miles of too-soft carpet, like ploughing through snow but with an extra helping of static, have been rolled up again.As shows go, this was a good one, with plenty of innovation, some stunning products and, of course, the nuttiest gadgets on the planet.The just-revealed products will arrive in stores over the coming months. Here are some of the best devices to look forward to.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis gadget manages to be both mainstream and quirky. It’s a wireless speaker (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) with a delicate, beguiling tone that is highly attractive.But it looks like something Florence Nightingale might carry because it has a glass cylinder growing out of it, with a light at its base.In fact, the glass vibrates and its resonance is what creates the sonorous sound.The light can even be set to flicker like a candle. It is perfect for romantic candlelit dinners, though it’s not cheap: £699.This was far from the only TV launched at CES but many of them seemed highly gimmicky: The LG rollable TV is plenty impressive and the Samsung 219-inch microLED screen called, appropriately enough, The Wall, looked just amazing.But for a TV you can actually buy that won’t break the bank, the GZ2000 was revelatory. The image quality on Panasonic is routinely outstanding, and there were certainly improvements over previous models.But this is a Dolby Atmos TV, and the first with upward-firing speakers hidden behind the screen.In action, these transformed the experience, creating a deeply immersive sound, especially when watching sport. The roar of the crowd was no longer just coming from in front of you.Withings makes spectacularly good health products and its smartwatches appeal because they have analogue hands like, you know, a real watch.This latest model, out in the Spring, will include an ECG monitor, something only the Apple Watch Series 4 has, and only in the US for now. This will be rather cheaper, at £130.An ECG reading occurs when you press on the watch glass (there’s another sensor pressing against your wrist on the watch’s back that completes the circuit).The Withings watch has a secondary dial which shows how close you are to your steps target, too. Oh, and unlike the Apple Watch, this will be compatible with Android phones, too.This was one of the coolest surprises at the show and comes from Sphero, makers of spherical robots and a brilliant Star Wars R2-D2 toy.But the company’s toys have always had a considerable educational angle to them, encouraging youngsters to learn how to code, for instance.Now, with Specdrums, there’s a musical angle, too. Two silicone rings fit to your fingers and when you touch a colour, then notes, loops or beats will sound.The colours can be on the coloured pad that comes with the rings or things in the world around you. Very smart.Back in the seventies, Technics released a turntable designed for DJs. It was incredibly popular and highly praised because it was well-built, very reliable and easy to use.There have been updates since then but this is the first for almost a decade.The new model, in a cool matte-black finish, includes features such as the capability to spin the disc in the opposite direction and neat features such as a long-life white LED positioned to make it easier to see the stylus tip when you’re trying to place it in dim, or no, light. It goes on sale in around May for £900.CES 2019: Chinese firms and US government among conference no showsA smartphone with a flexible screen that folds out to become a tablet, this was a hot gadget in Vegas.But it will need to move quickly to work – Samsung has said its own folder will be out in the coming months.There are certain issues with folding phones, such as the aspect ratio. A regular display looks almost square when unfolded or, for it to look like a regular tablet, it requires a wider-than-usual display when in phone mode. But it’s a sign of the future.This comes from the company that made the Nuraphone, a pair of headphones that go over the ear and also have a bit that juts into your lugholes to deliver strong sound.The NuraLoop is an in-ear headphone which, like the Nuraphone, measures your hearing and uses signal processing to adjust the output to suit your ears, personally.There’s noise-cancelling on board and a social mode that lets the sound of the outside world out as much or as little as you’d like.A pet feeder is straightforward enough, but what if it had facial recognition? So Fido doesn’t eat Tibbles’ food, for instance.This is also useful if you have two dogs, say, with different dietary needs.Or, if you leave the Mookkie in the garden, you can be sure that a stray cat won’t sneak in and eat it.There are two food bowls with separately opening lids. It’s on sale in the autumn for around £160.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Studies have linked ractopamine with adverse effects in pigs, especially hyperactivity, trembling, and broken limbs.WTO rules could cut Denmark’s total imports to the UK by 17 per cent, the OECD found, resulting in a 1.3 per cent fall in GDP in the medium term. The UK is Denmark’s fourth largest market, accounting for 7.8 per cent of exports in 2017.Britain’s parliament is widely expected to vote against\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Brexit deal on Tuesday, opening up outcomes ranging from a disorderly orce to a reversal of Brexit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said: “Time is running out to avoid a chaotic ‘no deal’ Brexit that would be catastrophic for the UK economy.“Firms in the finance industry have put contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for their customers in a ‘no deal’ scenario but critical cliff-edge risks remain, including on the transfer of personal data and the operation of cross-border contracts.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHe added: “It is now essential that politicians on all sides of the House work together to agree a way forward and provide much-needed certainty to the electorate and businesses, by ensuring our withdrawal from the EU is orderly and gradual. There must also be a sufficient transition period to enable our future relationship with the EU to be agreed and then implemented.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also warned of the “catastrophic” consequences of a potential no-deal Brexit. “The vote against the Brexit deal on the table brings us closer to the ‘no deal’ cliff edge that would be catastrophic for the automotive industry,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive. “All sides in parliament must work together to find a way forward and put the necessary mechanisms in place to prevent this happening and explore alternatives that protect our future.Brexit defeat makes history as biggest ever government loss in CommonsMay on the brink after huge Brexit defeat and Corbyn election planPound sterling plummets as Commons overwhelmingly rejects Theresa May\u0027EU president suggests UK remaining is only option“Leaving the EU, our biggest and most important trading partner, without a deal and without a transition period to cushion the blow would put this sector and jobs at immediate risk. ‘No deal’ must be avoided at all costs. Business needs certainty so we now need politicians to do everything to prevent irreversible damage to this vital sector.”Meanwhile, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce said there were “no more words to describe the frustration, impatience, and growing anger amongst business after two and a half years on a high-stakes political rollercoaster ride that shows no sign of stopping”.Mr Marshall said many basic questions about operational issues remain unanswered, with the result that businesses cannot plan properly for the years ahead. “Every second that ticks by sees more businesses spending money on unwanted changes, activating contingency plans or battening down the hatches and halting investment, as they try to anticipate a future that is no clearer now than it was at the time of the referendum result,” he said.“Businesses will take a dim view of more shuttle diplomacy and last-minute bargaining, which have so far done nothing to end the political impasse. The government must now urgently set out in concrete terms what it will do to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit on 29 March would cause to businesses, communities, and the UK economy.”The pound plunged against the dollar and the euro in the immediate aftermath of the vote on Tuesday night, then rallied, and on Wednesday morning was trading at $1.2865 and €1.1278. “Traders are seemingly taking the outcome as paving the way for an extension of the Article 50 deadline, rather than increasing the chances of a no-deal Brexit and this has caused the recovery seen in the pound,” said David Cheetham of XTB.However, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said there was still very little certainty about the next steps for Brexit and added that the vote of no confidence, which will be tabled by Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday, would be “another pinch point for currency markets, provides another pinch point for currency markets, so we can expect further swings in sterling as events develop”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It raises the chances of a \u0027no Brexit\u0027 or, at the least, an extension of Article 50, said Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors.Admittedly, the chances of a no-deal Brexit may mathematically have also risen, but the market remains ever-hopeful that the government will not commit an error of such epic proportions.But others suggested that the volatility was inevitable given the huge political uncertainty and the increased risk that the Government could fall.“A confidence vote loss is not a sterling positive international investors will see it as a negative for the pound given the uncertainty over the Labour party’s Brexit position and what a Corbyn government would mean for the UK economy,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst.\u0026nbsp“Sterling is living on borrowed time and could benefit from the government ruling out no-deal.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said that Ms May now needed a “new plan”.“Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately,” she said.\u0026nbsp“This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UK’s economy.”That message was echoed by Huw Evans, of the Association of British Insurers.“We need a way forward urgently that avoids no-deal,” he said.“This is uncharted territory and we face a period of unprecedented uncertainty.”“It is critical that the Government, Parliament and the EU work together to avoid an outcome that would be bad for our economies and bad for our customers.”“As things stand, UK law says we will leave on 29th March, with or without a withdrawal agreement, and yet MPs are behaving as though they have all the time in the world – how are businesses meant to prepare in this fog of confusion?” said Stephen Martin of the Institute of Directors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It raises the chances of a \u0027no Brexit\u0027 or, at the least, an extension of Article 50, said Seema Shah of Principal Global Investors.Admittedly, the chances of a no-deal Brexit may mathematically have also risen, but the market remains ever-hopeful that the government will not commit an error of such epic proportions.But others suggested that the volatility was inevitable given the huge political uncertainty and the increased risk that the Government could fall.“A confidence vote loss is not a sterling positive international investors will see it as a negative for the pound given the uncertainty over the Labour party’s Brexit position and what a Corbyn government would mean for the UK economy,” said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst.\u0026nbsp“Sterling is living on borrowed time and could benefit from the government ruling out no-deal.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said that Ms May now needed a “new plan”.“Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately,” she said.\u0026nbsp“This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UK’s economy.”That message was echoed by Huw Evans, of the Association of British Insurers.“We need a way forward urgently that avoids no-deal,” he said.“This is uncharted territory and we face a period of unprecedented uncertainty.”“It is critical that the Government, Parliament and the EU work together to avoid an outcome that would be bad for our economies and bad for our customers.”“As things stand, UK law says we will leave on 29th March, with or without a withdrawal agreement, and yet MPs are behaving as though they have all the time in the world – how are businesses meant to prepare in this fog of confusion?” said Stephen Martin of the Institute of Directors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PIP is designed to focus support on people with the greatest needs and that’s happening, with 31 per cent of people getting the highest level of support, compared to 15 per cent under DLA.“As with any major new benefit we have been flexible and adapted our approach, and we continue to make improvements to ensure PIP is working in the best way possible.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They welcome Theresa May’s deal, but only because it is better than the “existential” threat that no deal, trading on Word Trade Organisation terms, would involve.This, for example, is what Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said on the eve of the meaningful vote: “As MPs prepare to vote on the government’s Brexit deal, we urge them to remember they hold the future of the British automotive industry – and the hundreds and thousands of jobs it supports – in their hands. Brexit is already causing us damage –\u0026nbspin output, costs and jobs\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut this does not compare with the catastrophic consequences of being cut adrift from our biggest trading partner overnight.”“A managed no deal\u0026nbspis a fantasy,” Hawes concluded.To understand the interconnectedness of supply chains, consider that some 1,100 trucks loaded with parts cross the English Channel every single day, to deliver their goods direct to “lineside”, for car giants such as BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall.Brexit deal failure will lead to ‘national emergency’, warns CBI chiefToday’s factories are run on “just-in-time” principles – so any delay, and certainly delays of days or weeks, would cripple production, ramping up costs and shredding thin profit margins.For example, in its journey from a basic casting to its place revving around inside a new Mini Cooper S, a Mini crankshaft will travel from France to the UK to Germany and then back to the UK, and probably then back to the continent to be seen in a showroom. Stockpiling parts is old-fashioned and prohibitively expensive and unwieldy,\u0026nbspand disruption to production is intolerable. Sooner or later plants will be run down and volumes reduced to cut losses.Second, consider the position of Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port. With Peugeot having last year taken over GM Europe, of which Vauxhall was a part, it must soon choose where to place production of its next mid-sized models – the new Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot 308 and derivatives. With overcapacity, it has a choice to locate production – and secure jobs – in any of range of plants in France, Spain, Germany or the UK.The UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain. A promising growth industry is already doomedWith no certainty about the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe, and a need to concentrate production, Ellesmere Port, which narrowly missed closure before (a German plant went instead in an EU-wide effort to deal with the recession), is obviously threatened. Even Jaguar Land Rover is opening new production facilities in Slovakia. Toyota and Nissan (with its Renault alliance partner) could move new investment to the much bigger market in the EU. \u0026nbspThird, a no-deal exit will mean tariffs on parts and finished vehicles which will substantially add to admin and to costs. The UK exports far more of its production to the EU than the EU does to the UK, although Britain is a large and profitable market for EU-based firms. VW Group, for example, commands more than 20 per cent of British new cars sales\u0026nbspBMWMini is on about 10 per cent and Mercedes-Benz 7 per cent, meaning that about four out of every 10 new cars from German brands alone.For UK exports, adding 10 per cent to a car’s cost as it crosses the Channel would, again, destroy profitability.Last, the UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain –\u0026nbspand is already down significantly. Geely of China, which owns the maker of\u0026nbspLondon cabs, shelved a plan to build an electric van plant in the Midlands. Thus, a promising growth industry is already doomed.\u0026nbsp“Project Fear” for cars would proceed at slow speed. No one scraps a car factory overnight. The decline will be gradual, but inexorable. Makers such as Jaguar Land Rover, which\u0026nbsptend to export more to the US and the rest of the world than the EU, might suffer less and Rolls-Royce and Bentley (owned by BMW and VW Group respectively) might for the same reason feel less pressure but all rely on materials arriving from Europe, from engines,\u0026nbspgearboxes and\u0026nbspframes to\u0026nbspbraking systems and switches.Again, it would be relatively easy to transfer operations, even for quintessentially “British” brands. It would probably take five to ten years to relocate the auto industry abroad, much of it to EU bases in eastern Europe.After all, HP sauce, complete with its portrait of the Houses of Parliament, is made in the Netherlands nowadays. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Tory MPs want to put a time-limit or get-out clause on the policy, which is designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspSpeaking in the same debate, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the question was not how to break this deadlock in the UK over the way forward.I know it’s not up to me as a humble Belgian to lecture the Brits on what to do. But I think it’s time now to tell our British friends that for the sake of Britain itself it’s time for cross-party cooperation, as we do here, he said, urging the different factions to come out of the trenches and build a consensus.Elmar Brok, a German MEP and ally of Angela Merkel, criticised Ms May for reaching out to opposition parties “two years too late”, adding: “Mr Corbyn has said that he wants a customs union – what he should do is get a majority for the proposal and, once that emerges, that will be no problem for us.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European Commission, said the EU executive “regrets the rejection of the withdrawal agreement”.“Nobody should be under any illusion: Brexit does harm. It does harm to the UK, and it does harm to the EU,” he said.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentQuoting British author CS Lewis, he hinted at the possibility of the UK staying in the bloc: “We can’t go back and change the beginning, but we can start where we are and change the ending.”Melania-Gabriela Ciot, the Romanian EU affairs minister who is chairing the Council of the EU, said of last night’s vote: “Given the many conflicting messages that have been passed in the UK before and during the debates leading to the vote, on all sides of the political spectrum, it is hard to single out one particular explanation of this outcome.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

What happens after defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal?  What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Click to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May speaking after surviving a confidence vote of Tory MPsWe are entering one of the most uncertain periods in the modern history of Britain, with even the most experienced\u0026nbsppoliticians and commentators unsure of what the immediate future holds.This article will help you get to grips\u0026nbspwith some of the various outcomes from Brexit that the UK faces, and how we might get to them.It\u0026nbspwill be updated regularly as the picture shifts day by day...1 What are the key dates? 15 January: Theresa May suffers a devastating defeat in the Commons, after MPs throw out her Brexit deal by a record majority of 230 in the long-awaited ‘meaningful vote’.Before 29 March: There are various scenarios that could occur. She may try to go back to the EU to gain further concessions from Brussels as long as a defeat is not heavy enough to have crippled\u0026nbspher politically.\u0026nbspOtherwise, parliament may seek to use its powers to take control of Brexit and set a path forward.\u0026nbspThere may also be a move to\u0026nbspextend\u0026nbspthe Article 50 process to allow more time to push through neccessary legisaltion\u0026nbspor even for a second public vote.29 March: Brexit Day. Under terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, if a country triggers the withdrawal process from the EU, they have two years to try to conclude negotiations on how it happens before their membership automatically ends – regardless of whether those negotiations have been successful or not.2 What happens after defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal?The big question to which no one knows the answer. There are lots of possibilities now that May’s plan has been defeated. She will have to return to parliament to set out her plans within three days. Here are the routes likely to be pursued or rejected early on...\u0026nbspRenegotiation: Despite official indications from Brussels, there are clear signals from the EU that there will likely be an opportunity to renegotiate after a defeat for Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal.\u0026nbspThere are reports that there may even be an opportunity to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the hated \u0027Irish backstop\u0027. What the UK would have to give in return for any change to the backstop is unclear however, and nothing will be given for free.\u0026nbspThe prime minister pushes the deal to a commons vote... again: It may be that the PM does win some change to the withdrawal deal,\u0026nbspthat means she can go back to the commons and ask for it to be voted on a second time.\u0026nbspAlternatively, a\u0026nbspplunging pound and disruption to financial markets\u0026nbspcould also give May a reason to ask MPs\u0026nbspto vote again and push through her deal in the national interest.General election: Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to call a vote of no confidence in the government after a defeat for Theresa May\u0027s deal. But for this to be successful, lots of Tory MPs also need to vote for an election, and with their seats at risk and a left-wing Corbyn government waiting in the wings, they are not likely to do so...yet.\u0026nbspIf Ms May tries to push for a no-deal Brexit some Conservatives have vowed to do whatever they can to stop it.3 What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Now that it appears the PM’s strategy is dead, other possibilities have started to arise...A second referendum:\u0026nbspThere will at some stage be a big push for a new referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for the public to have a\u0026nbspFinal Say, with more than one million people signing its petition. The\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign has galvanised the support of politicians, celebrities and millions of others across the country.The new referendum would, however, have to be secured through a vote in the House of Commons and it appears that there is no majority for it at this time. Lots of Conservatives are opposed. Labour appears to be moving towards possibly backing one, but the party is split and Mr Corbyn is said to be against the idea. Even if Labour does back it, there are likely to be up to 20 of the party’s\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho still vote against it, because their constituents so heavily backed leaving the EU that it would risk them being ousted at the next election.Time could change this situation. As other possible outcomes are whittled away and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit looms, more\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspmay feel compelled to back a new referendum. The question of timing will be critical. Some backers feel the issue should be pushed to a commons vote, as an amendment to the “meaningful vote”, fearing that waiting will mean other outcomes take hold and become more likely. Others say if the vote is brought to the commons too soon, without enough support, and it falls – then supporters will lose their only chance of making it happen.\u0026nbspThere is also not a consensus on what the question should be in a new vote – in or out, May’s deal or no deal, no deal or Remain. Some suggest a three-way vote on May\u0027s deal, no-deal and Remain, with the option receiving the fewest votes being knocked out and votes redistributed, as in the “alternative vote”\u0026nbspelectoral system.\u0026nbspEven if a proposal for a new referendum is passed, there is every chance Leave could win again, of course.Plan B (Norway):\u0026nbspThere are those – including some in cabinet – who believe that once the deal is ditched the best plan would be for the UK to enter a Norway-style arrangement with the EU. This would either be\u0026nbsptemporary until a wider trade agreement can be arranged or\u0026nbspa permanent solution. It would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market. A “Norway-plus”\u0026nbsproute could also see the UK remaining in the customs union.But this is likely to enrage half of the Tory party in parliament, and probably all of the more\u0026nbspBrexitish\u0026nbspmembership, as a less than full break from Brussels. It also does not end “free movement”, risking a backlash from Leave voters for whom immigration was the key issue in 2016.An extension to the Article 50 period:\u0026nbspThe EU has indicated that the 29 March\u0026nbspBrexit day could be postponed, but only if there is a set course of action to postpone it for. In other words they could delay it for a new referendum or an election. It is not clear if they would do it for a late renegotiation.No deal:\u0026nbspThis is the default. After a defeat for May’s deal and if government and\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo, or are able to do, nothing else, then on 29 March Britain will fall out of the EU with no deal in place. Many\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare looking for ways to stop that from happening.It remains unclear whether the prime minister can continue after her deal with defeated by such a\u0026nbsphumiliating margin. She is expected to survive Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s no-confidence motion, but in order to win support she could soften her proposal to reflect a policy more in line with the Norway deal - something many Labour MPs\u0026nbsphave openly backed.Theresa May survived a vote of no confidence in December by 200 to 117, rebel MPs are not allowed to challenge the PM through the party\u0027s structures again for another year. \u0026nbspIt means if Ms May leaves Downing Street, it will now either by a result of her own decision that she cannot continue, a cabinet insurrection could render her position politically untenable and she may feel there is no other option but to leave Number 10.\u0026nbspIn an attempt to persuade MPs to back her in the no confidence vote, however, the prime minister told her colleagues she knew they did not want her to lead them into the 2022 general election - signalling she will stand down before then.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote. After the motion passed - defeating Jim Callaghan’s minority Labour government - MargaretThatcher emerged victorious in the resulting election, with a clear majority.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police monitor Brexit protesters outside the houses of parliament in London.

But economists say the measures were too limited to have a significant impact.As Mr Maduro’s second term got underway, the leader of the country’s opposition-led Congress, Juan Guaido, said last week he was willing to replace the president\u0026nbspwith the support of the military.Several government officials have said Mr Guaido should be arrested for treason and on Sunday he was briefly detained by intelligence agents.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nonetheless, there were foreign visitors among the gathered crowds.“It is surreal,” said Manuel Matthaus, from Germany, of the ash-covered holy men. I had always heard about them,” he told the Hindu newspaper, describing them as “one of the reasons we wanted to come to the Kumbh”.“I did plan to take the bath,” he added. “But I guess the water now is too freezing for my linking. Maybe later in the evening.”One concern for international visitors will be the environmental conditions at the festival site. A thick haze of toxic dust hung over Prayagraj for the start of festivities, according to the Associated Press, and PM 2.5 levels were measured at more than six times the World Health Organisation’s safe limit.The dust plumes encompassing the camp came from the sandy riverbanks, said city commissioner Ashish Goel, and not from construction, which has been banned for the duration of the seven-week festival.Nonetheless, they highlight the struggle the central government faces in tackling India’s air pollution crisis. Also this week, Mr Modi’s government has unveiled its plan to clean up the country’s air –\u0026nbspbut allocated just 3 billion rupees (£33m) to the cause over the next two years, less than a tenth of the cost of the festival itself.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

Supermac’s had wanted to expand to the UK and rest of EU.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMcDonald’s claimed the branding of Supermac’s\u0026nbspwas too similar to its own and would cause confusion among consumers. The Irish company\u0026nbspis named after its founder Pat McDonagh, who is said to have earned the name “Supermac” while playing Gaelic football in his youth.In April 2017 Supermac’s, which has over 100 restaurants across Ireland, submitted a request to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) asking the bloc to cancel the US fast food giant’s\u0026nbsptrademark on “Mc” and “Big Mac”.Domino’s and KFC among fast food giants ‘forcing misery on chickens’Supermac’s accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying” and registering brand names “which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors”.Lawyers for McDonald’s had provided printouts of its websites, examples of advertisements and packaging, three signed affidavits from its executives, and a printout of its Wikipedia page as evidence that it sells Big Macs across the EU and deserves a trademark.The EUIPO ruled that “the evidence is insufficient to establish genuine use of the trademark” on Big Macs by McDonald’s across the EU.McDonald\u0027s profits beat expectations thanks to its new Big Mac burgerUS President eats Big Macs, steaks and crisps on silver plates“Even if the\u0026nbspgoods\u0026nbspwere offered for sale, there is no data about how long the products were offered on the given webpage or in other ways, and there is no information of any actual sales taking place or\u0026nbspany\u0026nbsppotential\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsprelevant\u0026nbspconsumers\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspengaged, either\u0026nbspthrough\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspoffer, or through a sale.“Finally, as far as the relevant services are considered, there is no single piece of evidence that refers to any of the registered services being offered under the EUTM.”McDonald’s was also ordered by the regulator to pay costs of €1,080\u0026nbsp(£965) for the decision. It has the right to appeal. In the EU, trademarks can be registered both at a national and EU-wide level.Pat McDonagh, the managing director of Supermac’s, said: “The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition. We have been saying for years\u0026nbspthat they have been using trademark bullying.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

But for activists, the battle is not over yet.\u0026nbspTheir wider goal, they say, is demanding proper asylum rights from the city council.\u0026nbspAlvaro, a member of the solidarity movements\u0026nbspwho is writing a PhD thesis on them, said there was a strong socialist spirit of “fighting fascism, real estate speculation and gentrification by tourism”\u0026nbspamongst what he described as “solidarity networks”\u0026nbspacross the city.\u0026nbspHe added that it is thanks to such communities that refugees and asylum seekers are able to find places to live, “otherwise they would be left on the streets”.He said the asylum application process is difficult for many because they do not fit specific requirements and many end up without a roof over their heads.Created with Sketch.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.\u0026nbsp“It’s stupid to have people living here without these means because they will continue to stay anyway, so why not give them the chance to pay taxes and contribute to the economy?”Zac\u0026nbspleft Gambia in 2015, fearing for his life due to conflict between different political factions. He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was possible to buy its handsets for some time if you looked hard enough, its first official move into the UK came last November with a highly attractive, innovative phone called the Mi 8 Pro.This week, its second flagship phone goes on sale, the Mi Mix 3, and it’s even more eye-catching. It’s a slider phone. No, not like those tiddly Samsung feature phones from the nineties, this phone slides only about 1cm, enough to reveal the camera hidden behind. Which, in turn, means the phone\u0027s front really is all screen –\u0026nbspwell, technically it has a 93.4 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Unlike other full-screen phones, there’s no notch because there’s no need to find room for the camera.I spoke to Xiang Wang, the company’s global senior vice president and head of\u0026nbspinternational business. We met at the Barbican Centre in London and sat in a corner that defined the eccentricity of the building, with sloping floors and corridors that narrow unexpectedly. I began by saying that this was a building that made a strong first impression and asking him how he wanted Xiaomi to be seen as it arrives in the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I think the first impression of the brand should be that this is a cool company, very young, energetic and very cool, he said.\u0026nbspIt’s a very different culture and different product philosophy to others. That’s the most important thing we want to achieve.”There are certainly some differences that stand out from the start.

We were struggling to pick which one because we have so many,” Wang said.The new phone, the Mi Mix 3, was also a contender for being the first UK release. “It is another high-end model with a good camera, strong battery, new stuff inside. In the end, we went for the Mi 8 Pro because of its design with its cool transparent back, in-screen fingerprint sensor and so on. So, I think the UK audience may like it. We are also releasing a scooter, we think we picked the best, coolest products we have for the UK market.”Yes, that’s right, Xiaomi also makes an electric scooter. The range available in the UK includes half a dozen phones, a fitness tracker, a nightlight and a couple of power banks, but in China the products available are much more numerous. The plan is to offer a much wider range here, too, one day.“Through the Xiaomi stores we want to learn what the British consumer wants and needs so we can bring the right products to the UK. Now, we have just brought the hot-selling products from China and elsewhere because it takes time for us to do the testing and certification for the local requirements of each market. We think that in the future when we have a bigger customer base, we will have a better idea of what works for each country.”So, why is Xiaomi building its presence now in the UK? “I think the rationale is this. On 7 November\u0026nbsp2017 we had our first launch event in the western world, in Madrid, Spain. We tested the market and now we are number three in Spain. We work with all channel partners including online and offline carriers, including building our own Xiaomi stores there. The initial success in Spain gave us much more confidence for the western European markets. These are developed markets in which we had never worked before. Last May we launched our pilot service in France and Italy, in Milan and Paris and so the next natural step was the UK.”This may lead to different challenges, it seems. “The UK has a lot of technology innovations, plus art, fashion, and an energised younger generation. I think this could be a good place for us. There are also a lot of challenges in the UK because the normal consumer doesn’t know us. Those who do know us are engineers and the younger generation who have come across us on the internet. Also, in the smartphone world, the UK is still a carrier market, so we have to spend extra effort to make customisations for carriers. That’s another challenge. Overall we’re very confident.”When I met a senior executive at Huawei a year ago, he said it would be easy for the brand to be the world’s number one (it’s already climbed to number two, overtaking Apple in recent months, leaving only Samsung ahead of it). But that wasn’t the most important thing. What would be Wang’s ambition for Xiaomi?“Our ambition is not to become the number one smartphone hardware company – we definitely want to be one of the important and biggest tech companies in the world. But our aim is not just selling hardware, we are much more than a smartphone company. We build more products than that.”One of the standout features of the brand is the competitive price: Both the new Mi Mix 3 and the Mi 8 Pro are priced at £499, half the price of an iPhone XS. How is the company making the phone for that price?“Internally we are making huge efforts to improve operating efficiency. Actually, unlike traditional hardware companies, we do not spend huge sums of money on traditional marketing and billboards. We use social media and other channels to communicate our products. Basically, it’s word of mouth. If someone loves our products, they will tell their friends, family colleagues.”From 2018 the company set a maximum profit level of 5 per cent. If profit exceeds this, Xiaomi has said they will return the excess to consumers. “Yes, we did this already, last year. We gave coupons to our consumers which they can use to buy our products. That’s one way, which we did last year for Chinese consumers.”Xiaomi expects the range to grow in the UK, but Wang points out that there’s already something for every pocket.“Actually, we have the whole portfolio from the entry-level to flagship covered. We will gradually bring more but we understand we need to be focused, Wang said. The UK market is very different from others, there are still a lot of entry-level products but the high-end part of the market is very big. The phone network Three has been asking us to offer better entry-level products and we are doing that.In the mid-range we want to understand it better, we’ll listen to the carriers more.”It sounds like the company will see what works in China first, to get a clue as to what will work here in the UK. But Wang reveals that this may some day lead to products tailor-made for British tastes. “In the long run, once we have built more resources, we can think about products which can be designed specifically for the UK or Europe. But now we basically pick products from our portfolio. We have to do some customisation, for example the frequency requirements are a little different, so we have to add a band to serve European consumers.”This is now the fastest-selling smartphone in India- everSmartphone shake-up amid Samsung wobbles and the rise of XiaomiEvery phone manufacturer faces a challenge. Handsets have just become the same thing – a black oblong with a glass or metal back. How does Xiaomi differentiate?“The Mi Mix 3 is one way to stand out from the crowd. The competition is severe so we are competing on every front, for instance, design and material – the Mi Mix series was the first to use ceramic, as a unibody, the entire phone was built from one piece of ceramic, including the frame. That’s another choice. As for technology, we always partner with the best, for items such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor.”This is in the Mi 8 Pro, but not the new Mi Mix 3 which has a conventional rear-mounted sensor.Finally, how does he view competition?“I think competition is good – if everything is the same and we have efficiency, the cost advantage, from making it in China in large numbers, then we don’t need to make a lot of profit from the hardware. Other companies have a business model where they need to spend a lot of money on marketing. We don\u0027t do that, so our products are high quality but not high price.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But critics said the EU was giving us “diddly-squat”, withAfter Theresa Mays Withdrawal Bill was voted down by  votes to  in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn called a vote of no-confidence on the government."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000240614813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg children vandalised house brexit","story":"But who is the real Mogg  Heres what we know about the Conservative MP for North East Somerset, who has once again emerged from the back benches to deliver searing words on Theresa Mays Brexit deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered Parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He had batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.He was one of the  Conservative MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence, which triggered a leadership challenge on December , and ultimately failed to oust May.There has been speculation that he might try his hand for the role, but previous polls put his likelihood of becoming PM at -.In a scathing remark after Mays humiliating Brexit deal defeat, he told the Sun: Not only is the PMs deal now dead as a dodo, it makes dodos look positively energetic.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.A month before that graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What DOES is the Leave verdict of the .million majority and most Tory voters and members.If this Remainer-stuffed Government nullies or destroys Brexit they can kiss goodbye to their jobs and their party.They will have gted everything, our economy and our national security, to Corbyn’s anti-western Marxist rabble. Britain will never forgive them.OUR economy may be slowing a little . . . but the eurozone is in meltdown.Germany, its powerhouse, is close to recession.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails.

I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos. Everywhere.I do hope Olivia wins Best Actress for The Favourite at the Academy Awards. When she has an Oscar, fewer people will be able to afford her.LOOKING just like one of the “gilets jaunes” – yellow vests – who rampage up and down the Champs-Elysees every weekend, Bella Hadid wears a hi-vis sleeveless jacket.Apparently, Bella’s yellow vest cost £. She should protest about that.IT was a relief to hear from Olivia Newton-John that she is not at death’s door as has ly been reported, but is alive, kicking and feeling good.Apparently, the confusion arose when it started getting about that the star of Grease had gone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

The Prime Minister faces a vote of no confidence today after suffering a massive parliamentary defeat over her controversial EU withdrawal agenda. Labour launched a bid to oust the Government after Mrs Mays Withdrawal Agreement was overwhelmingly rejected by  votes to . Now Parliament remains fundamentally split over what form of Brexit would be best for Britain. But how do the options dfer   Despite the huge defeat the agreement may still be on the table in an amended form as Mrs May seeks cross-party talks for genuinely negotiable solutions she can take to Brussels. From the start of the Brexit process, Mrs May had insisted that she wanted a bespoke deal tailored specically for the UK and not an off-the-shelf model shaped around arrangements offered to other trading partners. The Withdrawal Agreement reached in November guarantees the rights of UK citizens currently living in the EU states and European nationals in Britain, settles the UKs outstanding liabilities to Brussels budgets for a payment of around pound billion and takes Britain out of the EU single market and customs union, the common agriculture and fisheries policies and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It offers a -month transition period after the official Brexit date of March   to prepare for the new arrangements. Alongside this is a Political Declaration agreed by the UK and EU, setting out a common determination to forge a close future relationship in areas such as trade and security. If this cannot be secured by the end of the transition in December , the period can be extended by a further two years. If the transition concludes without a deal, the so-called backstop must be triggered, keeping the whole UK in a customs union with the remaining EU to prevent a hard border in Ireland.  If no alternative to Mrs Mays deal is agreed, the default option is for the UK to leave the EU without a deal on March . This would mean there would be no transition period, and iniduals and businesses would have to adapt immediately to new arrangements. The UK would leave EU structures such as the single market and customs union and would fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, which require tarfs on many imports and exports. Experts and businesses have warned that an abrupt withdrawal could cause chaos, with speculation over gridlock at the Channel ports, empty supermarket shelves, a collapse in the value of the pound and even aeroplanes being stopped from flying. But advocates of no deal say the warnings are exaggerated and the UK would benefit by being able immediately to strike new trade deals around the world. Brexiteers argue that the UK could save its pound billion orce bill by leaving without a deal, but this could be challenged by the EU in the courts.  The holy grail for some Eurosceptics is an ambitious Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, removing tarfs from almost all imports and exports of goods, offering co-operation on standards and allowing mutual recognition of professional qualications. A Canada-style agreement would allow the UK to leave the EU institutions, end freedom of movement and strike new trade deals where in the world. Critics say that the model would severely restrict access to European markets for the UKs vital service industries - particularly the financial sector. But the options fans say services could be included in what they term a Canada-plus-plus-plus deal. Ministers warn that it would not resolve the backstop problem, as Brussels would still demand the North remains in the EU customs area to avoid a hard border.  Some supporters of a soft Brexit argue that the UK should take its lead from the members of the European Free Trade Association- Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland - and seek a close relationship with the EU short of full membership. As a member of the European Economic Area , Norway enjoys full access to the internal market for most trade in goods, but must implement the bulk of Brussels regulations without having a say in its decisions. It also pays substantial sums into the EU budget. Switzerland, which is outside the EEA, has a more remote relationship with the EU, based on dozens of bilateral agreements which must be constantly updated. The Swiss are required to follow EU laws in areas which give them access to the single market but make much lower contributions to Brussels budgets. Crucially, the arrangements do not cover services. Proposals for a Norway-style option often envisage a single market and customs union relationship with the EU after Brexit, but the Efta states are actually not part of the customs union. It is far from clear that existing Efta members would accept a UK application to join.  If the UK chose to abandon Brexit - either through a second referendum or by simply revoking its Article  notice of withdrawal - before March , it would retain its membership of the EU under existing terms. Trade with EU neighbours would continue to be free of tarfs and non-tarf barriers under single market rules, and UK and EU nationals would retain the right to work and settle in one anothers countries. The UK would keep its seat in the EUs decision-making bodies and hasty arrangements would have to be made for the election of MEPs in May. The UK would be subject to ECJ rulings and would continue to make contributions to Brussels budgets, currently running at around pound billion a year net, but the orce bill would no longer be payable. Future trade deals would be made as part of the EU bloc and not bilaterally. If the UK applied to rejoin after the Article  deadline has passed, it would have to go through a y accession process which would almost certainly involve giving up the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, as well as opt-outs in areas such as justice and home affairs. It could be required to join the Schengen free movement area and the euro as part of the price of readmission.

Last night the Prime Minister claimed she would discuss a way forward with senior parliamentarians from across the House after her Brexit deal suffered the worst defeat in Commons history. She also promised to come forward with an amendable Plan B by Monday. But within minutes No officials indicated she would not rip up her plan - and appeared to suggest senior MPs could mean backbench MPs. Today Mrs Mays representative in the Commons stuck the boot in. Not only did Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom slam Corbyn - she also reiterated key red lines like refusing to rule out no deal or delay Brexit. Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper said she was making a mockery of Theresa May’s proposal for cross party talks.   The chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee added: PM has to accept she failed by  votes - she can’t just keep digging in. MPs in Commons bars were left baffled by the PMs response to last nights vote. One told the Mirror: Did she even notice it had happened  Ms Leadsom was questioned today as the government faces a historic no confidence vote at Mr Corbyns hands at pm tonight. She repeatedly rubuffed questions from the BBC on whether Mr Corbyn would be approached. She said: Jeremy Corbyn had the opportunity yesterday to put to the house exactly what his alternative proposals were. He clearly has none. Instead what he seeks to do is disrupt the country [with a general election]... He needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do.   Labour hit back on Twitter: Disappointed @BBCrtoday failed to correct @andrealeadsoms obviously inaccurate claim that Labour doesnt have an alternative plan. We have been promoting it for months: a new Customs Union, a close relationship with single market, no race to the bottom on rights. Ms Leadsom indicated the government STILL isnt ruling out a no deal Brexit, despite a vast majority of MPs being against it. She said: No deal is better than a bad deal and of course its still the legal default.   She rejected suggestions that the government could delay Brexit . She said: “We’re clear we won’t be delaying Article , we won’t be revoking it and we are determined to deliver on Brexit on the th of March. That’s what we are seeking to do.” And she indicated Theresa May is trying simply to re-work her existing deal with the EU.  She said: The prime minister will then not necessarily be looking for brand new ideas that no one has thought of before, but actually seeking a consensus, actually a fresh initiative to find a solution that is negotiable with the European Union and that would command a majority in the House of Commons. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said today he and Mr Corbyn have not been approached for talks. And after Number  made clear that Theresa May remained committed to securing an independent trade policy after Britain leaves the EU, he warned she was in danger of negating any talks before they started.  She is now laying conditions down about those discussions which look as though they will prevent any discussion of a permanent customs union, he told BBC Radio s Today programme. That is what most of the other opposition parties support so she seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn left his home in Islington, north London, at around .am.  He refused to answer questions from reporters on whether the vote of no confidence is a distraction orhe will win it, and simply wished everyone a good morning. Meanwhile with just  days left to Brexit, EU chiefs have demanded she make the next move. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned: I dont think the EU is in any mood to change the Withdrawal Agreement signicantly at all. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this morning told MEPs he will respond favourably - but onlyBritish red lines change.

And it means Brexit and Britain are deeper in chaos than they have been since the vote to leave the EU more than two years ago. The country is heading for a turbulent few months as MPs mount a furious battle to avoid a no-deal exit on March . Expect Parliamentary showdowns, resignations, a vote of no confidence and a possible general election. Here are the most likely options - and some or all of them will happen in the wake of the vote.  Jeremy Corbyn tabled a historic vote of no confidence in the government in a bid to topple Theresa May from power. The Labour leader made the dramatic move just a few minutes after the Prime Ministers humiliating defeat on her Brexit deal in the House of Commons - the worst known result in history. A vote will be held tonight at around pm after an all-day debate starting after Prime Ministers Questions. Mr Corbyn will hope it will be the first successful no confidence motion against a government for  years - when Margaret Thatcher toppled the Labour government in . If he is successful it will trigger a two-week countdown to a general election campaign - with an election as early as March . Mr Corbyn said the confidence vote would allow the Commons to give its verdict on the sheer incompetence of this Government. But in a major blow, the DUP indicated they would not back him - leaving the vote with little chance of success. Leader Arlene Foster said: We will work with the Government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus. Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the Government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal. Labours leader can table unlimited no confidence votes in the governmentthe first is not successful. Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon told BBC News: If we dont win this no confidence vote this time, then we can bring it again and again and againnecessary. Click here for a guide to how no confidence votes work.  Theresa May made an immediate statement promising a further statement by Monday  January on the way forward. She said she will focus on ideas that are genuinely negotiable and have sufficient support in this House. She added: If these meetings yield such ideas, the Government will then explore them with the European Union. She promised to open cross-party talks with senior parliamentarians - but it appears this wont include Jeremy Corbyn and shes still trying to tweak the original deal rather than ripping it up. After another seven sitting days - so by Wednesday  January - MPs get a vote on those next steps. The vote has no legal effect but Theresa May promised to honour the will of the House of Commons. Yet ahead of the vote, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested Plan B would be along the lines of Plan A. Parliamentary rules usually prevent the Government asking MPs to vote on the same question butit tweaks the wording it could get away with it...  Theresa May previously refused to rule out holding the vote on her Brexit deal again and again and againshe loses. She even refused to rule out holding the vote  times. That is despite her warning a second referendum on Brexit would damage trust in democracy. Technically there is nothing in law to stop her putting similar questions to Parliament to get the right answer. But MPs warned it would be a breach of vital parliamentary convention.  Billions of pounds have already been spent on No Deal planning - and you can expect billions more. This includes turning the M motorway into a lorry park and spending poundmillion to boost ferry capacity across the Channel. A chunk of Acts of Parliament, plus more than  secondary emergency laws, will need to be rushed through Parliament. Thousands of extra border officers and Home Office officials are being hired to deal with extra paperwork. Several Tory ministers are expected to quit the governmentNo Deal Brexit starts looking inevitable. Tory vice chairman Tom Pursglove quit his post within minutes of the vote. They are said to include Business Secretary Greg Clark and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, along with other more junior colleagues.  A general election is triggered automaticallyno party can win the Commons confidence within two weeks. That could throw us into a campaign and vote on March  at the earliest - just weeks before we leave the EU. A new government would open up a whole new flowchart of possibilities, which we wont get into properly here. If Labour takes power, Jeremy Corbyn says he wants to renegotiate a better deal with the EU - which would require delaying the March  date of Brexit. However, he could be out-voted on that policy - because Labours election manesto will be finalised by committee once an election is called. That means, somewhat oddly, that Labour doesnt actually have a firm Brexit policy yet for the general election its trying to call. MPs will try to seize control - and block a No Deal Brexit  Pretty much the only thing MPs agree on is they dont want a No Deal Brexit. So expect them to pull out every trickin the book to try and block it in Parliament. No Deal is the default option, written into law. But Downing Street claim MPs could effectively seize control of the Commons, by upturning the age-old precedent that the government decides what is debated on what day. If that decision is passed to MPs, it opens up a whole wealth of possible changes to Brexit - and allows MPs to put forward a Plan B without government permission . It already looks like it could be going that way. MPs won an amendment that will force the government to seek approval for No Deal spending, one of two defeats to the government the week before the vote. Pro-EU Tories led by Nick Boles have also tabled a plan that would allow Parliaments supergroup, the Liaison Committee, to take chargethe nation is left rudderless. But committee chief Sarah Wollaston has complained that the liaison committee was not consulted by the plan and No  has warned against it. MPs could put forward their own Plan B...  If Theresa May faces undeniable pressure from within, or MPs, or theres a new leader, there could be a new option for Brexit. Ones that have been mentioned include the much-discussed Norway option, staying in the European Economic Area or EFTA. Remainers are largely in favour but Brexiteers say it would tie our hands and keep us bound to the EU. It would also prevent the UK halting free movement. ... And Remain MPs will push for a second EU referendum  Remain-backers have already been pushing for a second EU referendum, and those calls will only grow. There is no majority for it in the House of Commons yet. But Jeremy Corbyn is facing pressure to back it from more of his members in the Labour Party. He has promised to leave it as an option on the table - in his view, a last resort -the deal is voted down. But reports suggested  Labour MPs would pivot to back a Peoples Vote and demand their leader follows suit. The exact path to a second referendum isnt clear. And most say it couldnt be arranged in time before March .  The date of Brexit could be delayed - or cancelled  Britain could extend the  March date of Brexit -the EU agrees to as well. There would need to be a concrete reason to do this, and itd probably be a short extension. Also, the EU is holding its Parliamentary elections at the end of May, which would get in the way - badly. Alternatively, Brexit can be cancelled without the EUs permission by revoking our notication to leave under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. But while this is legally possible, dont expect it to happen under a Tory government any time soon. Ex-PM Sir John Major has urged Britain to do this in order to provide the time for a second referendum on EU membership. Theresa May could resign - and force a Tory leadership race  She cant be challenged internally as Tory leader again until December , because she won a no confidence vote and got a years grace. But Theresa May could, in theory, be forced to quit by the men in grey suits of her Cabinet. A day before the vote, Downing Street refused to rule out Mrs May quittingtheres a very heavy defeat. That would spark a Conservative Party leadership contest. In this case, a new leader would take perhaps a month or two to choose. First MPs would narrow the candidates down to two then the , or so Tory members would vote between the final picks. The winner would become Prime Minister, without needing to call a general election, and could take Brexit in a dramatically dferent direction. Andnone of that comes to anything  We leave on  March  with no deal.

It is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote and up to the British Government to indicate how we are going to take things forward on March  to an orderly withdrawal, he said.   Theresa May has promised to speak to senior parliamentarians and make a statement on next steps by Monday night.

This was restated in the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker to Prime Minister May yesterday, Dublin said in a statement. The Irish Government recognises, however, that a disorderly Brexit is a bad outcome for everyone, not least in Northern Ireland. It is not too late to avoid this outcome and we call on the UK to set out how it proposes to resolve this impasse as a matter of urgency. Irelands foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said the Irish government regretted the outcome of the Westminster vote. Mr Coveney told RTE News: We regret the decision but were not hugely surprised by it. I think the predictions were consistent enough over the last few days that this would be a heavy defeat and so we now need to be patient and calm to allow this process in Westminster to take its course.

She unwittingly plotted her path to parliamentary defeat almost exactly two years ago, when she painted her withdrawal “red lines”. The Prime Minister delivered a speech at Lancaster House in January  outlining what she wanted a future relationship with the EU to look like. Yet it was made without consulting opposition MPs, the EU, Tory backbenchers or even her Cabinet.The UK would quit the single market and customs union and end free movement, the issue driving many to reject the EU at the June  referendum.  There would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and Britain could sign trade deals around the globe. But in making this address, Mrs May threw away her one chance to unite a ided country, which voted by a majority of ,, to Leave. This stubborn leader made no attempt to craft a consensus and find out what could secure a Westminster majority. As Home Secretary, she had backed Remain at the referendum. On becoming PM, she felt she needed to demonstrate her Brexiteer credentials.That strategic misjudgment further alienated the ,, voters who opted to stay in the EU. But as well as fuelling Remainers’ disillusionment, she was building up Brexiteers’ hopes, unwilling to tell them compromise would be needed. It blew up spectacularly just after .pm today, as pro-EU MPs ganged up with hard Brexiteers to detonate her blueprint. The PM’s record shows she refused to listen, consult or learn as she went along. Secretive Mrs May had to be forced at every point to share information or give Parliament a say.   Campaigners had to take her to court so she would need MPs’ backing before Article  could be activated. She even tried to prevent last night’s “meaningful vote”. Opposition MPs resorted to an ancient parliamentary procedure to uncover Brexit impact assessments. The PM also resisted releasing key legal advice until forced to by MPs using the same arcane tactic. Whitehall frustration with Mrs May had been revealed weeks before her Lancaster House speech, when Britain’s ambassador to the EU resigned. Sir Ivan Rogers told staff: “We do not yet know what the Government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship with the EU after exit.” Calls to activate Article , the mechanism for starting withdrawal from Europe, were growing louder. Once triggered, the clock on a two-year deadline for exit would begin ticking.Yet still no major discussions took place with the Cabinet about what sort of Brexit the Government would seek. The PM could not face it. Time after time she dodged confrontation, choosing instead to plough on alone.   On March , , despite warnings, she triggered Article  anyway. She assumed she would eventually reach agreement with Brussels, and failed to plan for a no-deal Brexit. Yet the PM enjoyed record popularity ratings as the Tories led Labour by as many as  points. This lured her into a needless snap election, despite repeatedly denying she would call one. Returning to Westminster after an Easter walking holiday with husband Philip, Mrs May announced a vote for June , . Experts predicted a -seat majority. But the Tories ran a dreadful campaign. Loyal, able ministers were sidelined as Mrs May visited tiny gatherings of Tory activists, repeating her dire “strong and stable” slogan.   She carelessly surrendered David Cameron’s hard-won,slim, majority from two years earlier, forcing her to seek a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the hardline DUP. Realising time was running out to come up with a Brexit plan, she finally started drawing up plans to put to the Cabinet. After a Brussels summit of EU leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron, ministers headed to the PM’s Chequers retreat, Bucks, on July  last summer. They were presented with Mrs May’s blueprint, which they agreed on.The next day, Brexit Secretary David Davis quit. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson followed.Mrs May had failed to appreciate that compromises for Brexiteers would be easierthey could be made earlier. But, because she was too fearful to take them on when she had the authority and public support, she left it too late. New enemies were made.   Mrs May also seemed isolated at a Brussels summit last month, where she confronted EC President Jean-Claude Juncker after he accused the UK of being “nebulous” on Brexit. Though she survived a no-confidence vote that month, the seed of her deal destruction had been sown a year earlier, in December . Just before Christmas, she caved in to the EU’s border backstop arrangement for Northern Ireland so Brussels could say “sufficient progress” had been made for talks to move on. The DUP would never sanction the plan as Northern Ireland would be treated dferently from the rest of the UK, in a customs union with the EU under the terms of the backstop. This ghost of Christmas past is what came back to haunt the PM, something she knew was coming and which a better leader would have avoided.

Labours Tulip Siddiq was wheeled into the chamber ahead of the vote on Tuesday night. The Hampstead  Kilburn MP could be seen in the chamber chatting to other MPs including fellow Labour MP Stella Creasy and Conservative Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom. Earlier in the day Ms Siddiq, , had written on Twitter thanking people for support after making her decision. She said: My decision to delay my babys birth is not one I take lightly. Let me be clear, I have no faith in the pairing system, in July the Govt stole the vote of a new mother. Its my duty to represent Hampstead  Kilburn, and I will do just that.   SNP health spokeswoman Philippa Whitford said Ms Siddiq was due to have a Caesarean section because she has a high risk pregnancy and gestational diabetes. Dr Whitford told the Commons on a point of order after the Brexit vote: I have to say as a doctor to put our colleague at risk and her baby at risk because we cannot have a method of allowing those who are sick or pregnantis disgraceful. Her decision came after controversy in the summer when Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith ordered Tory Party chairman Brandon Lewis to break a pairing agreement with Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson while she was on maternity leave during a crucial Brexit vote.   Pairing agreements are used when MPs cannot make it to the Commons for votes for medical and other reasons. It means someone from the other side also does not vote to ensure there is no unfair advantage caused by their absence. Theresa May later said Mr Smith had made an honest mistake and had apologised.

The humiliated PM lost the vote on her EU plan by a staggering  majority that leaves Britain staring at a catastrophic no deal. After the crushing defeat – which followed two and a half years of botched negotiations with Brussels – Mr Corbyn launched a motion of no confidence in her shygovernment. It will be voted on at pm on Wednesday. But the stubborn PM refused to quit, despite the blow to her Brexit plans that left her stripped of all authority as MPs finally buried her deal.   Instead, she plans to resurrect it and try yet again to win over MPs before the next vote on Monday. Mr Corbyn branded Mrs May’s defeat “catastrophic” and said it represented an “absolutely shydecisive” verdict on her handling of Brexit. He added: “She is only attempting to reach out now to try to keep her failed process and deal alive after it’s been so roundly rejected by Parliament on behalf of the people of this country. “At every turn the Prime Minister has closed the door on dialogue. In the last two years she’s only had one priority…the Conservative Party. Her governing principle of delay and denial has reached the end of the line.”   Mr Corbyn’s no shyconfidence motion could force an early general electionit wins the support of more than % of MPs. But his hopes of winning were undermined when the DUP’s Sammy Wilson said the party’s  MPs will back Mrs May in her fight for survival. MPs voted  to  against her Brexit plans, which critics warned would leave us tied to the EU without any say on it. The huge Tory rebellion of  Tory MPs included fervent Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg as well as leading Remainers Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve. Her two former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab also voted against the deal. The -vote margin of defeat was the worst suffered by any government and in normal circumstances would be enough to force a PM from office.  But Mrs May made clear she plans to cling on, holding talks with MPs to find “genuinely negotiable” solutions she can take back to Brussels. She pledged to open cross-party talks with senior Labour MPs over the next few days to help save Brexit. But the invitation did not initially seem to extend to Mr Corbyn. And the PM appeared to rule out any dramatic changes to her deal with aides insisting it would form the basis of her Plan B. But she was last night looking increasingly boxed in with her Cabinet, her party and Parliament all urging her to change tack. Mrs May said: “The House has spoken and this government will listen. It is clear this House does not support this deal, but tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support.” As noisy crowds gathered outside Westminster she promised to approach talks Tory backbenchers, the DUP and Labour MPs “in a constructive spirit” but Downing Street immediately set out her red lines for talks. No  sources appeared to rule out discussing a customs union, a key Labour demand thought likely to command a majority, saying the PM wanted an independent trade deal. They also played down expectations of her compromising over a second shyreferendum or extending article . Mrs May insisted she was not running down the clock to no deal. She added: “Every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancour.”  But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said: “This was the biggest government defeat in over  years. “The PM says she now will listen and work cross-party but she had  months to do that and she repeatedly refused. “She cannot just carry on asnothing has changed.” Hilary Benn, Labour chair of the Brexit committee, added: “The PM says she is now going to reach out across the House of Commons, she could have done that two and a half years ago”.  But Attorney General Geoffrey Cox confirmed minimal changes were expected. He said: “This agreement will have to , in much the same form, with much the same content.” Remainer Tory minister Amber Rudd, backed by several Cabinet colleagues, led calls for the PM to reach out to Labour MPs to try to reach a compromise. Senior Labour figures indicated to the Mirror they could be open to shynegotiation. It emerged PM’s chief Brexit advisor, Olly Robbins, has been working on secret contingency plans for cross-party talks. Mrs May was urged her toto shyBrussels to demand more concessions EU chiefs warned the PM to “urgently” set out her plans as the clock was ticking down to Brexit. Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker said: “I note with regret the outcome of the vote in the Commons this evening. “I urge the UK to clary its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up.” EU Council president Donald Tusk added: “If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is ” "},{"url":null,"title":"thousands watch brexit vote unfold","story":"NewsopinionThousands watch Brexit vote unfold outside Parliament - and they agree on one thingTheres a festival atmosphere on Parliament Square, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree Theresa Mays deal is rubbishShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  JAN Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video brexit-blast-its-commons-vote-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs Theresa May hurtles unstoppably towards a humiliating defeat on her deal, she has had at least one success. Despite all the talk of a nation ided, furiously riven over what to do about our membership of the EU - she’s actually managed to unite Britain’s most ardent Leavers and Remainers on one thing. They all hate her deal. I’m referring, of course, to the people gathering outside the Houses of Parliament to protest about Brexit - one way or another. In what is rapidly becoming the political equivalent of Henman Hill, hundreds of Remainers are gathering in the cold on Parliament Square across the road, to watch the result of the meaningful vote come in. It’s like a rubbish Eurovision.  Meanwhile, a bit further down the road, more EU flags are waving, but they’re peppered with the odd pro-Brexit banner. I spoke to Leavers and Remainers, backers of a People’s Vote and folk who fancy a hard Brexit on WTO terms. And I couldn’t find a single person who was there to back Theresa May’s deal. Kate, who works in the NHS, and Pete, a retired journalist, have been standing on the corner all day with a sign that says “Hoot for Brexit”. Kate says they they’ve had “hundreds” of cars passing them and honking their horn since they’ve been standing there - including what looked awfully like a ministerial car, which passed while we were chatting. Pete doesn’t like May’s deal because it doesn’t take us out of the single market or EU rules. “I’d be happy with no deal, so we can make our own deals as we go along,” he said. He reckons the problem was that the EU have been playing hardball, and Mrs May hasn’t.   Meanwhile, across the square, Charlie Rone, a -year-old from Charlton is dressed up as Jacob Rees-Mogg, complete with top hat and tails. He’s a regular protester outside Parliament, and alternates between the Mogg costume and a Robocop outfit. He changes daily because press photographers have confided that they wouldn’t snap himhe was in the same costume every day, because they still have the previous day’s photos for sale. And he’s not a fan of the PM’s deal either. He said: “I hope that the deal gets thrown out, because it’s a very, very bad deal because it cedes all our control away to the EU and it puts us into their hands.” As we were talking, a gentleman in a van slowed down at the pedestrian crossing to advise Charlie to take his top hat and “stick it where the sun don’t shine.”   There’s also a fellow walking around the area dressed as a plague doctor, complete with a black hook-nose mask, shouting “THE BELL TOLLS FOR THE DEATH OF BREXIT.” He declined to be interviewed, but gives off the distinct impression he wasn’t a fan of the PM’s withdrawal agreement. The atmosphere in Westminster tonight is noisy, but relatively amicable. People are arguing about Brexit in the street - but they’re doing it quite politely. There’s little evidence of the sinister, borderline fascistic displays of intimidation that has been much discussed in recent weeks, but it hasn’t entirely gone away.   Tucked away in a corner, next to a small band of pro-Brexiteers hammering drums and ringing a bell, I spotted a placard bearing the slogan “CUCK YOUR VOTE”, and telling “CONSPIRATORS” they were “CHEATING BRITAIN FOR BROWNSHIRT POINTS”. Alongside a picture of Theresa May, there’s a small tree with a noose in its branches. But largely it’s a festival atmosphere, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree that the Prime Minister is rubbish.

The MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford asked him: Can you advise the House on what we might be able to do to urge the Prime Minister, for the sake of businesses and jobs and people across the country, to seek an immediate extension of Article  now so that this can be sorted out  Mr Bercow said: This will be discussed Im sure in the days ahead on the floor of the house. He added: Of one thing I am sure that which members wish to debate and which they determine shall be subject to a vote, will be debated and voted on.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it has been voted down in the House of Commons. So with time rapidly running out, plans are now being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has triggered  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Officials have sent thousands of letters to firms and have , troops held at readiness in the event they are needed. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and likely have stockpiles of food and medicine at the stroke of pm.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business and Brexit. Instead we have looked through the governments documents - primarily the  notices - to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But ministers are telling you to brace for them anyway... NOTE: This guide is accurate as of the time the technical notices were produced in late .  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament, butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn. Of course, this date has now passed - but pet owners are still encouraged to allow at least four months before travelling.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit , it has emerged. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport today says: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. Every Richard Curtis film has a grumpy character called Bernard because Tory MP Bernard Jenkin stole Curtiss girlfriend at university. For example, in the classic Christmas movie Love Actually, Bernard is Emma Thompson and Alan Rickmans horrid son. For more fun facts and trivia tune in as Christmas on Dave continues tonight at :pm with a QI Christmas Special.  But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.” Early December: Theresa May tours UK and G with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  January : By this point Theresa May mustto Parliament and make a statementshe still has no agreement. MPs then vote on a motion based on the government statement  days later.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit, the government said. The Armed Forces personnel are split between fully-employed service people and reserves, the Defence Secretary said. Gavin Williamson told MPs a request has not formally been received yet, but what we are doing is putting contingency plans in place. And what we will do is have , service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Mr Hancock has also claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. And the M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Stephen Waterson, , was in the front passenger seat and allegedly pushed it back on Alfie Lamb twice in anger over the “noise and fuss” he was making. The three-year-old cried out “Mummy” in the shyrear footwell and made a choking noise, the court was told. Mum Adrian Hoare, , who was sat behind Alfie, is charged with manslaughter alongside Waterson. Driver Marcus Lamb, , and Emilie Williams, , also in the car, will give evidence.   Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said Alfie died from crush asphyxia in February last year. He said: “It was caused by the passenger seat, Waterson’s seat, being moved further into the rear passenger-side footwell.  “In effect, he was squashed by the car seat and suffocated. “This was a deliberate action by Waterson who knew Alfie was there and was angered by the noise and fuss [he made].”  Medics and police were called in Croydon, South London, and Waterson and Hoare allegedly lied about what happened. Mr Atkinson said it was obvious Alfie had been dead for some time and CCTV showed all of them travelling in an Audi.   Hoare allegedly told medics: “We got in a taxi. He fell asleep. We tried to wake him and found him unresponsive.” She said the driver “kicked us out” and left. Mr Atkinson said it was “only the beginning of the lies”. Hoare and Waterson have also since attacked Miss Williams and Mr Lamb respectively, he added.  Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault. Waterson denies manslaughter and intimidating Mr Lamb. The couple, of Croydon, and Williams admit conspiring to pervert justice. The Old Bailey trial continues.

A letter sent to parents by Devonshire Park Primary School in Birkenhead, Merseyside, stated thata pupil is in arrears for dinners and does not have a packed lunch with them, then they will be given toast or a bread roll. The school argues that it was owed more than pound, in outstanding payments from parents last year - and its policies were no dferent to any other. But one outraged parent, who wishes to remain anonymous, described the policy as disgusting - particularly given the current economic climate. She told Liverpool Echo: [My friend] works as a single mum but struggles financially. I think it needs to be made aware that it’s not just Universal Credit that is causing families to live in poverty. Im guessing there will be plenty of parents in the same situation who have received the letter.   The note to parents and carers, revealed on Monday, said: If your child has a negative balance on their dinner money account they will not be provided with a hot meal. If they do not have a packed lunch with them, they will be given toast or a bread roll. Please ensure you clear any dinner money debt before the start of the new term. If you have any questions or are experiencing any dficulties, please speak to the office staff. A spokesman for the school said the policy for paid-for school meals is no dferent to any other and that the school already subsidises payments for lunches.   He added: The school fully understands the financial dficulties that some parents face and we always ask them to contact the office to discuss any issues so we can do everything we can to help. Often their circumstances may mean they are entitled to claim free school meals, but they haven’t been aware of it until we have spoken to them. Our policy on paid-for school meals is no dferent to any other school. We request that parents keep their dinner money balance in credit. If it isn’t, we still give pupils a hot meal and then ask for payment afterwards.   Every Friday, parents with a debt of pound or more are sent letters reminding them and requesting payment. The spokesman added: If the debt continued to grow we would ask parents to provide a packed lunch for the child and pay the balance off over a period of time that suits them. “The school already subsidises meals, having reduced their cost from pound. to pound. At the end of last term, the school was owed more than pound, in outstanding payments for school dinners. We would never allow a child to go hungry, but equally it would be irresponsible to allow parents to build up more and more debt. It is understood that the school has only had to enforce this policy on one occasion, when a child, whose parents had a debt greater than pound and who did not give their child a packed lunch one day. With the parent’s permission, that child got two cheese spread rolls that day, and their parents now provide packed lunches every day.

Out of  shops, a third were empty. But a year later Ashford council bought it for pound, from its French owner and revamped it and encouraging independent businesses. Traders were offered business support and help with refitting the shops and all the units are occupied. Family run tea room The Little Teapot opened for business in .Owned by husband and we Jacqui and Russell Geen, the business hit an obstacle when the ventilation system let them down. Russell said: “The council invested pound, on a new air conditioning system and also spent a lot time fixing leaks in the roof.” And on a bigger scale, Ashford Council also gave the go-ahead for a poundmillion leisure complex at Elwick Place which officially opens next week and Ashford Picturehouse opened its doors in December.   The Rents New independent traders taking on shops in Park Mall were offered free rent for up to a year and opened their books to council finance experts so they paid fair rates depending on how the business was shaping up. Claire Heal owns Emporia Fabric  Craft, a haberdashery business selling material for dress making and patchwork alongside yarn and a selection of Brother sewing machines. She also holds regular sewing, knitting and crochet classes for beginners and veterans.Claire said: “We were the first tenant to move into Park Mall three and a half years ago after the council bought the centre. “We used to be based in Bank Street in the town centre and were attracted here because it was a bigger premises in a better position.A huge incentive for me to move here was a six month rent free period offered by the council, that really helped my business establish itself here.”   The Events A series of events from dance acts and bands to farmers markets and an art trail are proving hits. The art trail based on the animation The Snowman and Snow Dog featured sculptures displayed across the town and an auction raised pound, for a hospice. Cllr Galpin said: “Coming into the town centre has to be more than just shopping – it has to be about experiences. “Town centres will need to be reinvented for le in the st Century. An important part is that fun element.”   The Big Brands While regenerated Park Mall is mostly home to independent stores, County Square is dominated by household names including Next, Debenhams, Oasis, New Look, Dorothy Perkins, River Island, The Entertainer, Pandora and Superdrug. The flourishing main mall complements the smaller one with the council ensuring there’s no conflict between the two.And a designer outlet on the edge of town also drives in footfall. While high street veteran Marks  Spencer announced on Tuesday it was planning to close down it’s County Square store, Cllr Galpin remained upbeat and said: “It’s regrettable that we are losing MS but we are actively looking at finding a way forward. The high street is ever-changing but there are always opportunities.”  The Co-operative A collection of  creative businesses called Made in Ashford acts as a shop window for artisan traders to test their products on the high street with short, flexible tenancies. Manager Melissa Dawkins said: “We have a very close and effective relationship with Ashford Borough Council, which has proved fundamental to our success in growing a fantastic business.They always listen to what we have to say and are receptive to new ideas. “We saw our best Christmas, with trading up % on December last year. We finished our year up % on our previous year.The shop has grown from strength to strength, peaking at  businesses trading from our store.” The Pride Factor Keeping the centre clean and safe has encouraged more shoppers to flock to the high street. Cllr Galpin said: “We have taken a great deal of care in curating it and we have restored pride in the town centre. “Families want to come and enjoy themselves, have a great day out and shop but also to have pride in their town.” The Car Parks To encourage more families to use shopping centres at off-peak times, ious car parks have free parking from Monday to Saturday after pm, on Sundays and Bank Holidays, or after pm on Sundays and Bank Holidays.

Stella Brown, , suffers from achalasia which affects the oesophagus and can mean the muscles cant contract properly. Swallowing can become near impossible with food and drink unable to pass through to the stomach and often being brought back up. Stella, from Leicester, said her disorder left her unable to swallow properly and in constant pain. Thankfully, after surgery her diet has been expanded, but Stella says for two years the only thing she was able to eat was Cadburys Creme Eggs. She told Leicestershire Live: To be honest, laugh or not - Cadburys Creme Eggs saved my le. They were the only food I could eat - odd I know but it is true. I had one one day and for some reason I could eat it and it just stayed down.   Speaking about how it all began, she said: It was really weird because I just woke up one day and I couldnt swallow. It got worse over the next two weeks and eventually I went to the hospital and they thought it was just a reflux and gave me some Gaviscon. Three weeks later, Stella said she was finding it almost impossible to keep water down, and was struggling to swallow anything at all. Everything started coming up, and I started to panic, she said. Theres not really any medication to ease the pain and I lost weight so much that Ive literally gone down to size  clothes. I was starting to get really depressed because of the weight that I had lost. I have had two operations to dilate my oesophagus just so I can swallow - which I struggle with every day.  At this point Stella claims doctors told her she only had a year to liveher condition did not improve. NHS guidelines say there is no cure to the disorder but certain treatments can help sufferers. These include medicine, surgery to stretch the oesophagus muscle, and botox injections into the ring of muscle to help it to relax. Stella has had two operations which have helped her. This surgery is called balloon dilation, and involves a balloon being inflated inside the oesophagus to help stretch the muscle so that people can swallow more easily. But Stella thinks herback to health is also down to the Cadburys Creme Eggs. She said: Before I started eating them I would faint a lot because I wasnt getting the energy I needed from food and would blackout. They saved my le. I carried one around with me wherever I went for two years. The symptoms, according to the NHS, are:choking and coughing fits heartburn chest pain repeated chest infections drooling of vomit or saliva gradual but signicant weight loss. Since having surgery, Stella says she can eat a bigger selection of foods, however she is still sick every day. Its dficult,I got to a restaurant, for example, I have to sit as close to the toilets as possible, just in case. And its not just her social le that has been affected.

But for Cath Ascroft, it is a reality she has had to live through five times. After three miscarriages, a baby who was stillborn at  weeks, and tiny tot Hendrix who lived for just  hours after being born  weeks premature, heartbroken Cath had almost given up on having another child. But then her prayers were finally answered with the arrival of baby boy Phoenix, now eight months – all thanks to a plastic band. Cath, , says: “Losing five babies seems especially cruel, and it’s hard not to think of what we’ve lost. “At times the grief has been overwhelming. “Having Phoenix doesn’t take away from the loss – in some ways it makes it even more poignant to think about what might have been. “But we are just thankful for our little miracle.”   Cath and partner Jonny Hall, of Southport, shyMerseyside, chose their son’s name as a tribute to their NHSangel Dr Alice Bird, who made his birth possible. Dr Bird, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Ormskirk Hospital in Lancashire, recommended rare keyhole surgery to place a synthetic band around the top of Cath’s cervix to prevent her going into premature labour again. Cath says: “The name Phoenix is a symbol of rebirth and hope for us – but also to honour Dr Bird, without whom our little boy wouldn’t be here.” Busy concentrating on her career as a shyjournalist, Cath admits babies were never on her radar until she got pregnant by accident and had elder son Marley, now eight. When Marley was two years old, Cath and Jonny, who runs a plumbing and electrical business, decided to extend their family and were overjoyed when a couple of months later Cath was pregnant again. Everything looked fine until the day before her -week scan when her waters broke in the middle of the night.  “Within hours I’d delivered my baby,” she says. “I was in shock. When they brought him to us, a perfect tiny baby boy wrapped in a blanket, I didn’t know how to feel. “I only held him for a short time, couldn’t process what had happened. “We didn’t even name him – this little boy who’d never even had a chance at le.” The couple had a funeral for the baby they had lost but struggled afterwards. Cath recalls: “It was so hard trying to carry on, going back into work to see all the sympathetic faces, struggling to find words to explain to Marley that there was no baby.” Apart from Cath being a carrier of the common Group B Strep infection, there was no explanation why it had happened, and they were told there was no reason not to try again. Five months later, Cath discovered that she was pregnant but at  weeks she miscarried. “I tried to brush it off and pretend it hadn’t bothered me, taking one day off before going back to work,” she says.  Have you been affected by the issues in this story  Email webnews@trinitymirror The following year she found she was pregnant again. It was dficult not to panic, but the scans all looked normal. And after  weeks into the pregnancy, Cath and Jonny felt confident enough to tell Marley he was going to be a brother. But two weeks later Cath started to bleed heavily. “When we arrived at Ormskirk Hospital, my cervix was cm dilated,” she says.“It seemed hopeless. At  weeks shypregnant the baby surely couldn’t survive. Lying in my hospital bed I met Dr Alice Bird.I remember her askingI knew what the likely outcome would be and me replying that I’m probably going to lose the baby. “She said, ‘We aren’t quite there yet’.” Dr Bird said they could sew Cath’s shycervix shut in the hope it would hold long enough for the baby to have a chance of survival. Cath went for the surgery and was given steroid injections to strengthen her son’s tiny lungs.She was also confined to bed rest. But at  weeks she went into labour and attempts to stop the contractions failed.   Their baby boy, Hendrix, was delivered and Cath only caught a glimpse of him before he was rushed to a special care baby unit. H e weighed just lb. Within hours of being born, Hendrix had shydeteriorated rapidly. “That was the worst moment of my le,” says Cath.“We stood watching as his vitals dropped and then they disconnected all his tubes and passed him to me.We watched him die in our arms – this perfect little baby we should have been taking home.” “The staff were so supportive, giving us as much time as we wanted to spend with Hendrix, taking tiny prints of his hands and feet to go in a memory box for us. “Marley took it particularly hard. He had gone to school a proud big brother, but by the time he came home he wasn’t. “The next few months were a blur. That second funeral was heartbreaking – he was in the tiniest of coffins. But we had close family and friends to support us.” Jonny and Cath resigned shythemselves to the fact they would never have another baby, but once again Dr Bird gave them a glimmer of hope.She had found a rare keyhole surgery that could be done at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. She believed a permanent band called a transshyabdominal cerclage could be tied around Cath’s cervix to keep it shut.She had the surgery and after  months became pregnant. Dr Bird was the first person she contacted, and despite being on maternity leave, she took charge of Cath’s case and booked her in for a scan. But the baby had failed to grow and Cath had to undergo surgery to have the foetus removed.  At , Cath knew her chances of conceiving were growing slimmer. Just as she had given up hope, she got shypregnant again in , and went into a panic. Once again Dr Bird was with her every step of the way.“She scanned me every two weeks, which was the only thing I had to hold on to. Alice and my midwe Linda Bishop were there for me all the way through.” Cath’s caesarean was planned for  weeks, and Phoenix was delivered by Dr Bird, who says: “Cath and Jonny showed unbelievable bravery. “I was delighted to deliver Phoenix.” Cath adds: “The moment I saw him will stick with me for ever, the smile on Alice’s face as she held him up. I’m not sure which of us was the most relieved. “Dealing with the years of loss and grief has been overwhelming at times, has left me a totally dferent person than I was before. “But thanks to Alice and the amazing NHS, we got our longed-for gt of le.” A Just Giving Page is raising funds for Ormskirk Maternity and Neonatal Unit.

Alfie Lamb was -months-old when his mothers boyfriend Stephen Waterson twice pushed back his passenger seat with force as he sat in a baby seat in the footwell, it was said. It is alleged Alfies mother Adrian Hoare and Waterson both shouted at the boy to stop moaning as he had little room to move. Hoare then slapped the boy before Waterson moved his front passenger seat back twice, it was alleged. Alfie then stopped moaning before starting up again and then made choking noises, it was said. But the jury heard Hoare and Waterson both ignored pleas from passenger Emilie Williams to check on him during the car journey.  Waterson and Hoare are accused of the boys manslaughter while in a Watersons Audi A driven by Marcus Lamb with his partner Miss Williams in the rear seat. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told an Old Bailey jury at peak, the car electric car seat could apply kg of pressure. He said Mr Lamb heard Alfie cry out mummy and make a choking noise when Waterson pushed the seat back. Referring to Mr Lambs statement to police, Mr Atkinson said: He said while they were out Hoare had been shouting at Alfie. He had felt pressured by Waterson to drive the car. He had been aware that Hoare, Williams and their children were in the back, but he thought Alfie was between the women on the back seat. In his witness statement he claried that when Alfie was first passed into the car, he was placed between Hoares legs in the rear footwell behind the front passenger.  During the journey he heard Alfie screaming and crying and both Hoare and Waterson telling him to shut up. He also heard Hoare slap Alfie. He then heard the sound of the front passenger seat moving backwards, and Alfie shouting mummy. A few minutes later, Williams told Waterson to move his seat forward, which he did. Alfie continued to cry and both Waterson and Hoare told him to be quiet.  He only became aware of problem with Alfie after the car stopped at Adams Way. Waterson has pulled Alfie out of the car and Hoare had said to him what have you done  Miss Williams told detectives the four had gone to Sutton to go shopping and on thetrip to Croydon Alfie was moaning because he didnt have much room. After her arrest in connection with the investigation at the end of February last year , Mr Atkinson said: Miss Williams said Alfie was moaning that he didnt have enough room.  And then Alfie stopped moaning and then after a few minutes Stephen moved his chair back again and Alfie started moaning again but Adrian said that we was going to be home soon so itll be fine. He carries on crying for a few minutes and then he became quiet, so Adrian thought he had fallen asleep. But before that I noticed that he was like, it sounded like he was about to bring up sick but he didnt and he swallowed it again. So I told Adrian to check him but she didnt, she said he was fine and he was just coughing.  Mr Atkinson added: She would hear Alfie make a choking noise when the seat was back over him. She mentioned to Waterson and Hoare that Alfie was choking and they dismissed her concerns. The court heard Waterson fled after the boy fell unconscious and sold the car very quickly afterwards. Mr Atkinson said: The case centrally concerns a blue Audi. It belonged to Waterson, who sold it very quickly after this incident. It was recovered and taken to Perivale car pound. Williams, Waterson and Hoare, all spoke about lying to the police when they realised Alfie was unresponsive, the jury heard. And when arrested Miss Williams changed her original story about the taxi and said she had lied out of loyalty to Hoare. Hoare and Waterson, both of Adams Way, Croydon, south London, deny manslaughter. Hoare denies further charges child cruelty for placing Alfie in the footwell and common assault on Williams on February . Waterson denies intimidating Marcus Richardson, also known as Marcus Lamb, on  February.

The young girl is strapped into the buggy as it rolls off the pavement and in front of the car approaching a queue of vehicles at a red light. As driver Bodrul Islam hits the brakes, a pedestrian runs across the road and pushes the child to safety in Longsight, Manchester. Mr Islam claims the toddlers parent had no idea the child had rolled into traffic, telling the Manchester Evening News the girl was just like a deer in headlights.   The -year-old engineer, from Burnage, was already slowing down for the red light when he spotted the child and slammed on the brakes at about .pm on Tuesday. He initially thought it was a trolley, and said the girl was unaware of the danger she faced. After the child was wheeled back onto the pavement, a woman appeared from a shop nearby and shoved off and ran, Mr Islam claims. He said she didnt say a word to him or the Good Samaritan who pushed the child out of harms way in Stockport Road. Mr Islam said of the incident: It is always rammed at that time.    I think I had already started braking for the light. There was a van, and just as I passed, I saw it and thought it was a trolley. I slammed my foot on the brake, I thought I was going to cause an accident. He added: I stopped and I was shouting and swearing as I got out my car and I realised it was a kid. I put my hazards on and a guy ran across the road and grabbed the kid. It was a little girl, she didnt know what was going on, she just like a deer in headlights.

The Met Office are forecasting a drastic change in conditions from today as we say goodbye to milder temperatures enjoyed last weekend before a freezing snap sets in. Saturday could see large parts of the country blasted by winter showers, causing weekend travel chaos.The UKs cold weather alert has been raised to level two - alert and readiness - because the conditions could be le-threatening to vulnerable Britons and services could be disrupted.Forecasters have been monitoring the longer-term forecast, predicting the rest of January and into February could possibly see conditions similar to last years Beast from the East. Meteorologist Marco Petagna said the drop in temperatures will come as a shock to the system following a spell of mild weather. But, will your area be hit with any wintery showers    Today The cold snap is expected to hit Britain from today, with snow expected in some areas.High ground across northern Scotland could see several centimetres falling from today onwards. Heavy rain and possibly some lighter wintery showers will move across Scotland and northern England, moving south-eastwards. Colder and brighter conditions could move in later today, followed by wintery showers over hills and to lower levels in the north of the country. As temperatures drop overnight, snow could fall across lower levels of Scotland, northern England and Wales.   Thursday It will be a frosty start on Thursday with icy patches as colder air sweeps in from the Arctic. Wintry showers, including snow and sleet, could hit in the north and north east. Elsewhere it will be a sunny but cold day for most, with winds easing but temperatures remaining bitterly cold. Thursday night is expected to bring an overnight frost for most areas - setting the tone for a very chilly weekend ahead.Chief Met Office Meteorologist Dan Suri said: Most of the snow showers will be over the hills and mountains, although snow could fall to lower levels in the north, and also some eastern parts of the country during Thursday.   Friday As temperatures plunge over the course of Thursday night and Friday morning, a clear night means most of the country will wake to a widespread frost. Despite a clear and cold day for most, the Met Office is predicting outbreaks of rain and hill snow will move south-eastwards at times on Friday. Most of the heavy snowfall will accumulate on the higher ground of Scotland, with the possibility of a few centimetres.   Saturday On Saturday, a wider blast of winter weather could sweep across the country - bringing sleet and snow to more southerly parts. An Atlantic front will move in on Saturday, bringing outbreaks of rain, sleet and hill snow, likely to affect south-west England and perhaps parts of central southern England, the West Midlands, and north-west England. Further east is predicted to remain cold and dry.

In the s, Tskaltubo, in west-central Georgia, was a thriving spa town famous for its thermal springs. The waters of immortality bubbling up from the ground were believed to possess healing properties for more than a thousand years. As part of a mandatory state-funded programme, citizens were even given vouchers to visit the spas. By the s, Tskaltubo had become an important resort, serving thousands of visitors across nine bathing houses and  hotel-like sanatoriums. One bathing house was even built exclusively for Joseph Stalin. But after the USSR collapsed in the early s, the stream of socialist visitors started to dry up.   Although some of the spas are still al, many of the once grand buildings were left to be reclaimed by time and nature. Urban photographer Roman Robroek took his Sony ARii on a visit to the formerly bustling resort. The -year-old said: The area is unique due to the fact that the baths have constant running water. Therefore, it is constantly being refreshed and never loses its temperature of  to C.  Many of the sanatoriums that were thriving  years ago, are now abandoned, in heavy decay, and crumbling. Romans eerie images show deserted arcades with columns topped by crumbling turquoise arches - that open onto balconies with views of the woods beyond. In one of the sanatoriums vast courtyards, trees and other foliage have almost completely overrun the space, with vines sprouting from the elaborate brickwork.   And wide stone staircases spiral down to the now empty bathing pools, where the ceramic tiles barely cling to the walls. But the buildings are not completely deserted. After the fall of the Soviet Union, a bloody conflict between Georgian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the Abkhazia region saw thousands of refugees fleeing their homes. Many of them found the disused spas, and made them their home.  Roman said: Before entering any of the buildings with residents, I asked for permission to enter. This was mostly with hand gestures, since there is rare knowledge of the English language. Every resident that I met was most generous and helpful. They showed me where to enter the building, smiling and waving. I have nothing but respect for the attitude these people have, and I sincerely hope that good will come to them soon.  There are believed to be more than , internally displaced peoplesliving in the crumbling and decaying buildings in Tskaltubo. Roman added: The government has promised that all IDPs will receive a new apartment in [nearby] Kutaisi by , but barely anyone believes they will be ready on time. Theyve been working on them for almost four years now, and hardly anyone has been able or allowed to move.

It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"andy dales to join dundee but another signing needed after andrew davies blow","story":"Jim McIntyre was boosting his Dundee squad with the arrival of English winger Andy Dales yesterday but is set to resume his search for a centre-half after injury fears over another new signing Andrew Davies was confirmed.Twenty-four-year-old Dales was due at Dens for training yesterday morning after the Dark Blues agreed a deal with Scunthorpe.The former Derby kid can play on either flank and also in a central role.After  years in the youth ranks at the Rams, Dales stepped down to non-league football before moving to Scunthorpe last summer.

The sole motivation of the owners is to offset the losses of the club against any gains made by Dark Blue Property Holdings.#The club met with the appropriate solicitors to discuss this matter over the following months in order to move the process forward.#In July  the Supporters Society enquired whether within this process they could move their class rights associated with the ‘A’ shares into a shareholding agreement.#The owners of the club took into consideration this request, as taking on the Society shares would save time and money needed for the share issue process, and therefore began negotiations in good faith to purchase the ‘A’ shares from the Society.#The acquisition of the ‘A’ shares has potential benefits for both sides, and while the negotiation of the finer details has yet to transpire, one such benefit is that the club could operate in a more commercial manner, which would allow for idends to be paid. This could also allow for greater investment into the club.#It is disappointing to see that the Society has chosen not to make it clear that at no time has the merging of the Dundee clubs ever been discussed in any of these meetings, nor has it ever been contemplated by the owners of the club.#The owners of the club will continue to take informed and proactive decisions that are best suited for Dundee Football Club.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c3c74dfcf9c70.25745917.jpg ","title":"dundee people there is nothing else like this farmshop in dundee","story":"This butchery is a cut above the rest with a passion for its craft and sourcing quality Scottish produce.The Butcher The Baker was opened in December  by Jonathan Clark, who is also part of the Clarks Bakery business, on Anfield Road in the city’s West End.The massive butchery features high quality meats, with the whole production process on display, and also an extensive range of wines, gins and beers which have been sourced from mostly all Scottish companies with the exception of a few beers.Operations manager, Dan Bunce, has been at the business for the past year and prides his role in the “farmshop in the city”.He said: “There is nothing  like The Butcher The Baker in Dundee.“Farm shops aren’t accessible to everyone so we wanted to create an environment which is bringing that feeling to the city.“Although we have that farm shop style and are doing everything a bit dferently, we do not bump prices up.

That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian

this curious looking head-gear be the worldrsquos earliest surviving example of a Glengarry-style bonnet once worn by Highlander clansmen after the act of Proscription banned Highland dress That is the belief of relentless researcher Robert Harbord who is spurring-on staff at Inverness Museum to help solve the mystery.Being Oxford-based and an avid Highland visitor, Mr Harbord is perplexed by the bonnet which nestles inconspicuously behind glass in a cabinet in the museum building.And his task in hand is no mean feat: He wants to track down the inidual who unearthed it more than  years ago ndash or at least speak to one of their surviving relatives.Because he believes the bonnet is unique.He said: ldquoDespite their very best efforts, and their best record-keeping going back to , Inverness Museum does not have any other information on this particular item other than it was found in a peat bog in Fort Augustus pre-s.\"Its origins are a complete mystery.ldquoMy hope is that an article in the Courier might stimulate someone who does know more about its origins to come forward.Research shows bonnets in the lead up to the Battle of Culloden were knitted affairs, large, wide and flat.Insight into the crucial role they once played has been handed down by many historical sources but none so colourfully than the thcentury government roads contractor Edmund Burt who was sent to Inverness from London in the s.Remarking upon the Highlanderrsquos hardened stance to the wet weather in his letters to a friend, Burt, in his book Letters from the North of Scotland said their bonnets were ldquofrequently taken off and wrung like a dish-clout, and then put back on again.Mr Harbord said his research suggests that following the Act of Proscription in  banning Highland dress, clansmen pushed the sides of their bonnets upwards \"and at a stroke created an entirely new shape of bonnet\".And he strongly suspects that the Glengarry-style bonnet in Inverness Museum could be the earliest surviving example.He added: ldquoWhile the word bonnet was not actually mentioned in the Act, it can well be imagined that a clansman from Glen Garry, travelling to the strategically sited Fort Augustus six miles away, might think thathe was spotted by an Army patrol wearing a Highlanderrsquos traditional flat blue bonnet, he could very well be arrested, and jailed for six months, on the spot.Museum curator xxx apologies her name is in the caption of the pictures xxx said no information exists to argue otherwise.She said: ldquoWe think that it came to us before . Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible. If it does turn out to be the oldest one then that would make it a very signicant object. We would be delightedthat could be confirmed in some way.Wednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119131.jpg","title":"Inverness cafe closure purely a commercial decision","story":"A CAFE occupying one of the most prominent sites in the city for the past five years is to close, but the owner has refused to blame steep rates for the decision to sell.The -plus staff of So Coco at  High Street were given redundancy notices last weekend, and it is likely the popular restaurant, famed for its Spanish-style chocolate and churros, will close on January .However the owner, the Caledonian Coffee Co Ltd, is actively seeking a new business partner and other premises, and So Coco could rise again after a period of ldquohibernation.Director Roy Dinnes said he was sad to see the business close, especially for the staff who were ldquoa credit to the business, and he was amazed at the social media reaction that saw more than  dismayed customers post comments within  hours.It was purely a commercial decision said the Forres hotelier, and a deal with the new owner of the premises is at an advanced stage.

Lewis is convinced boss Derek McInnes is building an Aberdeen squad that can deliver glory.Which is why the -year-old believes it is vital the Dons emerge from the January transfer window with their three Scotland caps still at Pittodrie.There is already interest in Gary Mackay-Steven and Graeme Shinnie and the Dons are on red alert for another bid for Scott McKenna.When the window shuts at the end of this month, Lewis hopes the Reds have won the battle to retain their international stars.Captain Shinnie and winger Mackay-Steven are both out of contract at the end of the season and have been free to talk to other clubs since the winter window opened on January .Boss McInnes wants to secure both on extended deals, but admits he faces a fight to do that.MLS side New York City, part of the City Group Football franchise that also owns Manchester City, have targeted Mackay-Steven.The American side contacted the Dons while they were at a training camp in Dubai to inform them of their intention to talk to the winger’s representatives.English Championship clubs Brentford and Hull City are also monitoring Shinnie.Aberdeen knocked back bids of £ million from Aston Villa and £.m from Celtic for McKenna in the summer.Aberdeen are braced for potential bids this month – but Lewis hopes any fresh approaches are also rejected.He said: “We want to keep all our good players and Graeme Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven are two of our better players.“It is flattering for them, I am sure, for them to have that interest.“It shows how well they have been playing and how well we are doing as a club that other teams are looking at our players.“We turned down offers for Scott McKenna in the summer and hopefully we can do the same this month for him.“The squad we have here is fantastic and we are trying to build something.“So we want to keep all of our best players.”While Lewis hopes there are no exits from Pittodrie in January, boss McInnes aims to bring in at least two new signings in this window.He has targeted a left-back to replace Max Lowe, who has ed to Championship Derby County following the end of his loan deal.McInnes also aims to secure another addition to

first step to lting the trophy for the first time since .The walls of Pittodrie are adorned with photographs of triumphant cup-winning sides and Lewis wants to add his name to that legendary list.He said: “When you play for Aberdeen the expectation is there to challenge for every trophy you are involved in.“There is no reason why we cannot win that trophy.“You hope for a decent draw, but regardless of who we get, we should be favourites in almost every game we play.“There is that drive within the squad to go and win a trophy and be another team that has lted a cup.“When you walk round Pittodrie you see all those photographs of winning teams.“I want to be part of one of those sides.“Since I have been here that has been an ambition of mine.”Aberdeen will go into the tie as hot favourites against Stenhousemuir, who are rock bottom of League One.But Lewis insists the Dons will treat the part-timers with the utmost respect.He said: “The Scottish Cup tie with Stenhousemuir will be our first game back for a little while but there will be no excuses.“There is no reason why anyone would take their foot off the pedal for that game or take Stenhousemuir for granted.“I am sure they are a team who have good quality.“They will see this as a massive game and a  for them to showcase their skills and to possibly move on from where they are.“We have to make sure we match Stenhousemuir’s commitment and drive to win.“We have to show we are a better team and have better players, but first have to match that hard work and determination.“You have to show that in every game.“If you don’t have that in any game then you run the risk of losing.”Aberdeen arrived back in the Granite City late last night after their week in the United Arab Emirates.However, it was no holiday in the sun as boss McInnes put the Reds through double training sessions.Lewis insists they will be ready for the second half of the campaign, beginning against Stenhousemuir.He said: “That was the third season we had been out in Dubai and the players are tremendously grateful to the club for putting the trip on.“You don’t get it at most clubs.“Not only did we get a trip to Dubai, we also stayed at a fantastic hotel and used training pitches that were second to none.“As much as the training was dficult, it was nice in between sessions to lie on the beach and get a bit of sun as

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"sleazy pensioner took pictures schoolgirls","story":"NewsSleazy pensioner took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirtsA court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence, writes Edwin Lawrence.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleazy retired architect took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirts.

You’re guilty all day long.” The sherf heard evidence from neighbours in Ayr’s Peggieshill Road who saw McKay in a four-wheel drive vehicle near Belmont Academy. Gary Cornelius, , saw McKay taking sneak pictures with his phone – every time schoolgirls walked by. He took a note of the car’s registration number and called the police. Mr Cornelius said: “It was obvious he was taking photos of every single girl who passed.” This incident occurred in mid  – and Mr Cornelius was shocked to see McKay’s vehicle outside his house again, on March , .

discussions have been taking place behind closed doors between community groups, the Scottish government, councillors and club members regarding a takeover of the premises.And the clubrsquos administrator has agreed to support Peebles Community Trust in its efforts to buy the building.Under an agreed arrangement Peebles Community Trust will occupy and manage the club until the purchase is complete.And once the buy-out has been finalised, expected to be later this year, it will act as headquarters for the Trust, Peebles Ex-Servicemens Pipe Band and Peebles Mens Shed.The first stage of a grant application from Scottish Land Fund to purchase the property was completed this week.Peebles Community Trust chairman Lawrie Hayworth praised the co-operation and support shown by French Duncan, the administrator, club members, the Scottish government, local councillors and partner organisations.He told us: \"This has been the home of the Peebles pipe band since the club opened more than  years ago.\"The pipers and drummers practise here and use the club to store their equipment and they are an extremely popular feature of the townrsquos social le.ldquoMeanwhile, members of the

members of the more recently-founded Mens Shed group.Mr Hayworth also hopes the re-opened club will be popular with other local organisations.He added: \"We plan to create a space for a wide range of organisations to undertake their activities with the ability to store their equipment on site.\"This has been a particular dficulty for many groups for whom having access to on site storage has been extremely dficult.\"We envisage this as a community hub offering the widest possible use by groups who require both activity and storage space, whilst retaining the ability to host popular fundraising

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Sure, it features hills, glens and, with David Tennant playing protestant reformer John Knox and Martin Compston in the role of Maryrsquos controversial third husband the Earl of Bothwell, some of our finest actors. But with the titular role being filled by Irish actress Saoirse Ronan, is it really credible to suppose the film can have any impact on our futureit canrsquot even provide an authentic reflection of our past  Worse still, has it deprived one of our home-grown actresses the opportunity to portray one of our best-known historical figures The argument for authenticity in casting is one that continues to rage, particularly when star names are seen to be taking roles that could be better filled by lesser-known minority actors. Yet as Bryan Cranston said when defending his decision to play a quadriplegic in comedy drama The Upside, as the job of an actor is by definition to portray someone they are not, it makes sense for casting decisions to take account of who is likely to attract the biggest audience rather than whose le most closely matches that of the character. After Cranston won global acclaim for his portrayal of chemistry teacher turned criminal mastermind Walter White in hit TV show Breaking Bad, it simply made good business sense for The Upside director Neil Burger to cast him in his film. The business-case argument is certainly a sound one and, as the casting of American Andie MacDowell in quintessentially English film Four Weddings and Funeral showed, giving a film the potential to attract a much wider audience can have a knock-on positive effect for film-making more generally.Read more: Mary Queen of Scots film reviewBut of course the arguments to the contrary are sound too. When Cranston was initially cast in The Upside, US disabled-rights group The Ruderman Family Foundation, which had earlier objected to the casting of Alec Baldwin as a visually impaired man in Blind, slammed the move as discriminatory. ldquoCasting a non-disabled actor to play a character with a disability is highly problematic and deprives performers with disabilities the chance to work and gain exposure, its president, Jay Ruderman, was quoted as saying at the time.Such attitudes are leading to change, with Holywood actress Scarlett Johanssen last year pulling out of playing transgender male Dante lsquoTexrsquo Gill after a backlash from trans actors and queer activists. Similarly, the straight actor Darren Criss, who played gay characters Blaine Anderson in Glee and Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, vowed never to take such a part again for fear of becoming ldquoanother straight boy taking a gay manrsquos role.A logical extension of that would be that those from minority groups should also be excluded from playing non-minority roles, but the recent experience of Surrey-based Grange Park Opera shows the danger inherent in that argument. Having committed to staging George Gershwinrsquos Porgy and Bess in the summer, the company has run into casting dficulties because it has been unable to find enough singers for it to meet the legal requirement of having an all-black cast. Though Gershwin wrote the opera in the s as a vehicle for black performers, the implication of Grange Parkrsquos experience is clear: with too few roles explicitly written for people from their background and there still not being enough opportunities for them to fill roles that are not race-specic, black people have made the self-fulfilling decision that the opera world is not for them.These are all issues that Mary Queen of Scots director Josie Rourke, whose background is as artistic director of boundary-pushing London theatre the Donmar Warehouse, is clearly well aware of. Though she has all but ensured the filmrsquos commercial success by casting Hollywood favourite Ronan as Mary alongside Australian stars Margot Robbie and Guy Pearce as Queen Elizabeth I and William Cecil, she is also promoting ersity by casting ethnic-minority actors Gemma Chan, Adrian Derrick-Palmer and Ismael Cruz-Cordova in what would undoubtedly have been white roles.As Ms Rourke herself says, when it comes to acting everyonersquos just pretending anyway, so it really is no big deal that Mary isnrsquot being played by a Scottish actress. Andher telling of Maryrsquos story attracts audiences to Scotland and our economy gets a boost in the process, then so much the better.Read more: Mary Queen of Scots film review"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9253157.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brexit-nicola-sturgeon-urges-mps-to-take-greatest-chance-of-staying-in-eu-since-2016","story":"The First Minister called on MPs to vote down Theresa Mays Brexit deal and grasp the opportunity to have another referendum.:Brexit: Theresa May braced for humiliating defeat as historic vote loomsMs Sturgeons message comes as the UK Parliament prepares to vote on the Prime Ministers deal for leaving the EU.She said: \"People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly against Brexit.

Ms Sturgeon denies that her chief of staff had prior knowledge of the specic complaints, though she concedes that Mr Salmondrsquos future had been discussed ldquoin the context of #metoo ndash which rather suggests that he was being warned off.Read More: Sturgeon accuses Team SalmondThis takes us into another ongoing aspect of this case: the presumption of innocence. The First Ministerrsquos many supporters on social media have been condemning Mr Salmond for making le more dficult for the ldquocourageous women, as the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described the civil service employees who made the complaints. This public speculation about Mr Salmondrsquos presumed guilt actually does no service to those women. As the former President of the Scottish Law Society, Ian Smart ndash a long-term critic of Mr Salmond ndash pointed out this week, such prejudicial commentary could undermine prospects for a successful prosecution. ldquoIfthis matter should ever proceed criminally, he wrote, ldquothese are remarks upon which any competent defence team will undoubtedly seize.The police have been examining Mr Salmondrsquos conduct over recent years and questioning employees and colleagues of the former First Minister to establish whether there is any evidence of similar sexual harassment. This is standard practice in such cases. But it is dficult for details of an investigation into such a high-profile figure as Mr Salmond not to leak into the public domain.No one knows whether Mr Salmond will be found to be innocent, I certainly have no wish to speculate on this. But many of his supporters believe that the most likely outcome is that the police will find insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. This could be the worst of both worlds for the SNP, because some would declare Mr Salmond guilty by default, others would condemn the Scottish Government for investigating him in the first place, and for making the allegations public.Whatever happens, Mr Salmond has made clear he will claim damages from the Scottish Government, which will rack up the already-substantial legal bill being paid by the taxpayer. That will renew the attack on Ms Sturgeonrsquos handling of the affair. Opposition parties may eventually support the call from the former SNP minister, Alex Neill, this week for a full judge-led inquiry into the procedures and practices of the Scottish Government that led to last weekrsquos Court of Session fiasco.So, this story could run and run ndash but will it destroy the SNP Government  I doubt it. In the end, Ms Sturgeon is not directly implicated in the mishandling of the Salmond inquisition ndash that was her civil servants. Moreover, Brexit and the aftermath to last nightrsquos vote will dominate politics for the next year. Scottish voters are quite capable of looking beyond questions about Mr Salmondrsquos personal conduct to the bigger issues.However, a bit of ision right now might be no bad thing. The SNP is far too averse to controversy, and it is about time it had a proper debate about its future and its leadership structures. Making a fetish of unity, and ignoring political reality, is almost as dangerous as a split."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-european-media-react-to-crucial-brexit-vote","story":"In France Le Monde says Mrs May was subject to a \"humiliating defeat\" that left the future of her Government and Brexit \"more uncertain than ever\".The Prime Ministers loss is on the front page of El Pais in Spain, which says the \"crushing defeat\" make the \"crisis\" over Brexit worse.: Brexit crisis just got much deeper ndash who,anyone, will take control In Germany Der Spiegel says Mrs Mays Brexit plan has been \"shattered\" and asks: \"Must she go now \" - while a commentator for Bild describes the situation as \"Brexshit\".In Belgium LEchos headline reads \"The shadow of a hard Brexit\", while La Libre Belgique mulls \"the jump into the void of the British parliament\".The Brexit vote is also on the front of two papers in Sweden, the Svenska Dagbladet, which leads with Mrs Mays \"historic loss\", and the Dagens Nyheter, which says: \"After the historic setback - Mays fate can be decided today.\"In Denmark the national Jyllands-Posten leads with the \"big defeat for May\", saying it leaves Brexit facing \"maximum insecurity\".:Theresa Mays Brexit deal suffers historic Commons defeatDescribing the loss as a \"humiliating defeat\" that has \"thrust Britain further into political chaos\", the New York Times picks up on Mrs Mays warning before the vote that the decision will \"set the future of our country for generations\".The paper says: \"Like most others, though, the prime minister had no easy answers about the way forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-to-scrap-free-sunday-city-centre-street-parking","story":"The move comes after the council says free parking was having a damaging effect and a lack of availability as drivers park for free for longer.The council is proposing charging on a Sunday the same as Monday to Saturday with a pound per  minutes or pound an hour with a maximum stay of two hours, meaning there will be parking charges seven days a week in the city centre.Currently, there are no charges on SundayPoor air quality and increase pollution are thought to be one of the reasons free parking is considered being removed with drivers looking around for a space thought to be a contributor to congestion and air quality.Good vehicles and deliveries being able to unload are also being affected by free parking on Sunday according to the council.The Councils plan is to introduce restrictions to encourage drivers to move on and ensure there is a sufficient supply of short term parking spaces in the city centre for shoppers, tourists and businesses.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council told The Evening Times: ldquoThe current situation leads to a number of problems such as congestion, frustration for motorists struggling to find somewhere to park, dficulties with loading and unloading vehicles, all underlined by unacceptable levels of pollution.ldquoThe proposals are about ensuring the best and most even use of the limited space for street parking in the city centre.ldquoBut they are also about encouraging better use of under-utilised car parks and encouraging a sht to more sustainable forms of transport.ldquoThe recent Connectivity Commission report highlighted the need for radical change in the cityrsquos transport system.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress.

Francis Fukuyama – he who announced, prematurely, perhaps, the end of history – is certainly of this view, as he explains in his recent book, Identity. But it is not just in the political arena that identity has been a much-discussed topic: philosophers have long been concerned with the problem of personal identity and what makes us the same person across time . As a philosopher might put it, is pthe same entity at t as at t  To which Joxer Daly, the inimitable bar-room philosopher of Seán O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock, might say: “That’ s the question, Captain! That’s the question!”Joxer Daly was quintessentially Irish, as was O’Casey. And that ties in with my theme of Irishness, in that I have been thinking recently about how many people have suddenly become Irish. An old friend of mine, whom I had always believed to have been Welsh to begin with, and who then became Scottish by habit and repute – to use the old term of informal marriage in Scots law – suddenly announced that he was Irish and acquired an Irish passport to prove it. This, of course, was something to do with the recent political uncertainties surrounding British and indeed Scottish identity, into which we do not currently need to go. Suffice it to say that he had identied an Irish grandmother and acquired his new nationality on the strength of that.Irish grandmothers are very useful. Many people who did not know that they had an Irish grandmother are now discovering that they have one, and writing off for their new Irish passports on the strength of that. Others who may not have ready access to an Irish grandmother have been investigating the possibility of acquiring one, and have, in many cases, succeeded in finding perfectly serviceable Irish grandmothers at very little cost. This process reminds one of the wonderful scene in di Lampedusa’s novel, The Leopard, in which the wealthy parvenu to Sicilian society is introduced as a man who has many distinguished ancestors, or,he does not currently have them, will surely have some soon.: Brexit: Voting down Theresa May’s deal is in national interest – Ian Murray MPIrish grandmothers come in the living or dead category. There is a strong argument against acquiring a living Irish grandmother, as this may involve future expenditure in terms of birthday presents and so on. Deceased grandmothers are more convenient in every respect, and cannot in any event challenge your assertion that you are their grandchild. This is important when you are applying for your Irish passport, as it can delay mattersthe grandmother on which you base your claim appears to have no knowledge of your existence. You can try putting this down to forgetfulness on her part, but that may be dficult to establish.How do you establish your Irishness for passport purposes  Many people, without a great deal of Irish ancestry in their past, are put off from applying because they fear that documentary evidence will be required, and they have none. This is unnecessarily defeatist: Irish Consulates are usually very agreeable places, staffed by charming persons of impeccable Irishness, and usually more than happy to help. I’m sure, in most cases, they will take you at your word, andyou insist that you are Irish and do so in a reasonably credible way, they will come up with the passport bypost . But do not overdo it. Some applicants go to the consular authorities dressed entirely in green. This is not advisable, as Irish consular officials can usually see through that sort of thing. All is required is the occasional phrase that indicates Irishness, such as “Would you look at that sky now. Sure, aren’t we in for a spot of rain, so we are.” That will do it. Do not attempt to speak Irish to the officials, nor to fill in your form in Irish, unless you are skilled in the language. You may end up applying in Early Irish, which is quite dferent from the modern language, and being given, as a consequence, an Early Irish passport, which is of very little use.: Brexit: Huge poll shows % favour second referendumOn the subject of grandmothers, the question might be asked: “If an Irish grandmother is so useful, of what use is a Scottish grandmother ” This is a very interesting question, the answer to which is that a Scottish grandmother will entitle you to play rugby for Scotland. Many people are unaware of this rule, which is applied with generosity and admirable consistency by the Scottish Rugby Union. If you have such a grandmother, then you are entitled to play rugby for Scotland and, furthermore, entitled to be selected. This rule applies whether or not you have any knowledge of the game, although caution should be exercised before putting yourself on the national team. Rugby is a contact sport, and not everybody enjoys that sort of contact.Going back to the newly Irish.

But we are not.As the leader of the UK Government, she has spent the last two-and-a-half years developing a plan to fulfil the result of the Brexit referendum and leave the European Union. And, on this most important issue, she has failed. And failed spectacularly.Her Brexit deal met the biggest defeat for a British Government in more than a century, eclipsing the record of  held by Ramsay McDonald in .But the crises of recent times utterly pale in comparison to the situation Britain faces today. And, regardless of The Scotsman’s view, it appears likely that May will win a confidence motion in the Commons today, a bizarre prediction in keeping with the growing bizarreness of the situation.Ahead of last night’s vote, May told the Commons that her deal was the only option. After the vote, she said she would hold talks with MPs, thento the EU, suggesting she would look for another option. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, noted the vote “with regret” and urged the UK to “clary its intentions as soon as possible”. One of the first things May should do – assuming she does survive today’s vote – is seek an extension of Article  because, as Juncker said, “time is almost up”. We need more of it. And the EU should accept that request. It would be in the economic interests of both parties, and also their political interests.: Theresa May’s Brexit deal overwhelmingly rejected by MPsSigns that the UK, one of the world’s biggest economies, is struggling to leave will act as a warning to other EU states thinking of doing the same.During that extension, May will clearly try to find a solution to break the impasse, but it seems unlikely the EU will make any signicant concessions.The  referendum was a hugely isive event, but the Government has done its best, in dficult circumstances, to honour the result. Unfortunately, there was always an element of fantasy about the promises of a “have our cake and eat it” deal from the likes of Boris Johnson. Regrettably, Jeremy Corbyn appears to have joined the fantasists’ ranks, claiming the UK could have a deal of that ilkonly he were Prime Minister.So it’s understandable that the vision which persuaded  per cent of people to back Brexit has not been turned into reality. And that means the Brexit question has now changed and, therefore, it requires a new answer from the people, expressed in a second EU referendum.: Brexit: Time for wishful thinking is over, Irish Government warns UKHowever, there are dangers associated with this course of action. Brexiteers who believed the issue was settled in  may feel aggrieved – and with some justication. There is a risk that some will boycott the vote, undermining the result. Others may decide that democracy has been betrayed and may – wrongly –conclude that unrest is therefore justied.Make no mistake, a badly handled second referendum would pose a serious threat to law and order in this country. Faith in democracy, a most important thing, could be badly damaged.In order to minimise the chaos involved, the question would have to be agreed with leading Brexiteers. Given a clear majority of MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, hard Brexiteers may actually be sympathetic towards a second referendum that offers this choice as it seems like the only way this could happen. Speaking last night, Nigel Farage appeared open to the idea and suggested Leave would win a second referendum.Any ‘People’s Vote’ could not be a Remain stitch-up – or be seen to be one.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857068.1547586294!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland faces loss of a modernist masterpiece martyn mclaughlin","story":"The demise of St Peter#s Seminary near Cardross would rob Scotland of an architectural wonder, writes Martyn McLaughlin.It was never intended as a great secular pilgrimage – quite the opposite, in fact – butyou veer off Carman Road, a country lane which ekes its way up the north bank of the Clyde, you can still discover one of the country’s th century marvels.When I first visited the former St Peter’s Seminary two decades ago, the path was less certain. Overhanging branches of yew trees obscured the route, with the invasive species of contemporary Scotland – glass Buckfast bottles and empty Tennents cans – dubious navigational aids. Along the way, however, there were abundant hints of wonder: sandstone gorges spanned by moss-flecked stone bridges, the ruins of a th century castle, and walled gardens which nature had long since robbed of their Victorian order.Yet nothing quite compared to the final reveal, when the unruly woodland seemed to thin out and bow in quiet reverence before the seminary itself, a building so out of place and time it makes Cardross feel like Scotland’s answer to Roswell.It is a journey that has been made over the past three decades by countless artists, designers, and writers intent on savouring a contested architectural masterpiece in person. How sad it is we can offer future generations no guarantee of following in their footsteps.The news coverage of St Peter’s earlier this week will be wearily familiar to those who have championed the building’s merits over the years. Its owners, the Catholic Church of Scotland, conceded it was in a state of limbo and faced an “impossible situation” in trying to secure a future for the site.: Church warns it is in impossible situation over seminary ‘albatross’Such a quandary has defined St Peter’s almost from its opening in . At its peak, it only ever housed little more than half the number of trainee priests it was intended for. By the time the Second Vatican Council decreed that the community, rather than isolated cloisters, was the best place for their education, the building’s fate was sealed.A short-lived rebirth as a drug rehabilitation centre offered some respite, but a building designed to do God’s work eventually went to the devil. In the years that passed, a host of unrealised solutions for St Peter’s were floated, but they were either drearily lumpenor fancul .Only in the past decade did a thoughtful and pragmatic blueprint emerge courtesy of Angus Farquhar’s NVA, one of Scotland’s most energetic and ambitious arts organisations. It moved mountains to turn St Peter’s into an arts and community facility through partial restoration and consolidation of the abandoned and careworn structure.Having secured millions of pounds in backing, it restored scores of the seminary’s vaults and rid it of hazardous material, even offering a hint of what might be possible with Hinterland, a spectacular  art installation which harnessed St Peter’s desolation as well as its energy.: Joyce McMillan: The closure of NVA is immensely sad, but the company leaves a lasting legacySadly, such promise went unfulfilled with NVA’s collapse last summer. The reasons for its demise are numerous, but included increased costs within the capital funding package and uncertainty over whether a Scottish Government loan could be repaid over the next quarter of a century. The nail in the coffin was being turned down for long-term funding by Creative Scotland, which put paid to any alternative plans for the site. Now, with St Peter’s abandoned once more, the church has described it as a “huge albatross around our neck”.Ronnie Convery, communications director at the Archdiocese of Glasgow, explained: “We can’t sell it, we can’t give it away, we can’t demolish it. We are in a Catch  situation. We would literally give it away for nothing but we can’t find anyone to take it off our hands.”On the one hand, the church deserves sympathy for its reluctant stewardship of the A-listed white elephant. It has indeed tried to give away the building, only for potential suitors to realise the extent of their obligations.Yet the church must also realise that even the promise of handing over an internationally signicant treasure for free is not enough. It will cost several million pounds on top of what NVA spent simply to make St Peter’s safe, and there are few bodies with that kind of money to spare. One of them, however, is the Archdiocese of Glasgow. It is currently sitting on more than £m in funds, as well as fixed assets and investment properties with a net book value of nearly £m. It is not duty bound to delve into its coffers to come to St Peter’s aid, but perhaps investing a modest sum towards its preservation is the only way it can finally be freed of its burden.There are glimmers of hope. Argyll and Bute Council has designated the land surrounding the seminary as an “area for action”, while Historic Environment Scotland is currently considering viable options for the building’s future at the behest of Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop.Granted, the local authority barely has two pennies to rub together, while the quango is not in the business of saving derelict shells for the nation.Butthey and the church can work together, it may help broker some kind of compromise. No one realistically expects St Peter’s to be restored to its former majesty, but neither should we stand by while a slice of modernist brilliance disappears from view.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857076.1547587375!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon and alex salmond agree to co operate with holyrood inquiry","story":"Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond are to be brought before a Scottish Parliament inquiry into the botched sexual harassment investigation into the ex-first minister. A Holyrood inquiry is to be established into the case that has rocked Scottish politics as revelations continue to emerge over secret meetings between the SNP#s two most senior figures about the claims.Relations between Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor have degenerated into open hostility amid claims of a “smear campaign” by the former leader, who alleges some iniduals are out to remove him as a political threat. A special committee of MSPs will be set up to look into the collapse of the government investigation after allegations by two women about Mr Salmond. He denies the claims. A separate police investigation in ongoing.The inquiry will examine the meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond while the Holyrood inquiry was under way and the process used by the civil service in handling the complaints. The new Holyrood investigation comes on top of an inquiry by an external  of advisers into potential breaches of the ministerial code of conduct after Ms Sturgeon referred herself to this body. A \u2028spokesman for Mr Salmond said: “Alex will be happy to co-operate, in principle andasked, with a parliamentary inquiry which seeks to examine how the administration of the Scottish Government could get itself into a position where the Court of Session had to rule that it had acted ‘unlawfully’, ‘unfairly’ and ‘tainted by apparent bias’.“We believe the Permanent Secretary should already have accepted the responsibility for that expensive farce, which has cost the Scottish people an estimated £,.“Everyone, those who complain and those complained about, has the right to the protection of a procedure which is fair, balanced, confidential and above all lawful.”The First Minister has previously made it clear she would co-operate with any inquiry held by MSPs into the case. The investigation was agreed by all parties on Holyrood’s business bureau yesterday, including the SNP.The SNP hierarchy has been plunged into open warfare after the collapse last week of a government internal inquiry into Mr Salmond over claims from female civil servants of sexual harassment relating to his time as first minister. Holyrood officials will prepare options on its remit and membership, which is likely to include measures to ensure it does not conflict with an active police investigation that is under way. The government conceded defeat last Tuesday after a legal challenge brought by Mr Salmond at the Court of Session when it emerged the head of the investigation, before being appointed, had been in contact with the women making the complaints about their cases.Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “An investigation has been botched, two complainants have been let down and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money has been wasted.“These are clearly matters for the Scottish Parliament to investigate and the inquiry must be able to examine what went wrong and why this was allowed to happen.“The setting up of the inquiry does not mean that legitimate questions cannot be asked – or answered – in the short term.”He added: “This scandal cannot be swept under the carpet. Parliament must, and now will, get the chance to probe this matter fully, learn lessons and ensure it can never happen again.”The affair has seen relations between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon nosee, with the First Minister accusing her predecessor of a “smear campaign” over the meetings.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described news of the Holyrood inquiry as a “positive step forward”.He said: “Full transparency in this matter is essential in order for the public to have confidence in the First Minister and the Scottish Government. That means full public and parliamentary scrutiny.“At all times it is essential to remember that at the centre of all of this are two courageous women who put their faith in a system that has badly let them down and we must never lose sight of that by safeguarding the duty of care to them and their access to justice.“We must restore trust and confidence in the system.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the police investigation must be the priority. “These complaints deserve to be thoroughly investigated by the police without political interference,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4856801.1547561617!/image/image.jpg","title":"recruitment drive targets call of sea","story":"The search for the next generation of seafarers in Glasgow has launched thanks to a collaboration between one of the world#s largest ship-owners and a UK maritime charity.Teekay Shipping, which has a regional hub in Glasgow and a presence in Aberdeen, is working with Trinity House, a charity dedicated to safeguarding shipping and seafarers.In a move that reinforces the maritime roots of Scotland’s largest city, the pair have joined forces to recruit cadets from across the UK to undertake a three or four-year training programme that could lead to a permanent role with Teekay, either onboard or ashore.The collaboration will be administrated by Chiltern Maritime, a cadet management company specialising in marine cadetships.

The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given.

However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1376897.jpg--.jpg?1546959914000\n","title":"agewell partnership delivering handyman service to residents","story":"Mid  East Antrim Agewell Partnershipare a local charity working across Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne to support older people.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy. What’s not to like Whether Little England or Global Britain, the UK is splintering.And we, locked in the Northern Ireland entity, may soon be admitted to the franchise.

Mrs May has called for politicians to back her deal or risk letting the British people down. But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated.MPs will also be able to suggest amendments that could reshape the deal before voting commences this evening.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald TD has said the EU backstop cannot be set aside or diluted.Speaking from Stormont after she and Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill met leaders of the north’s main political parties, Mary Lou McDonald said: #Whatever transpires at Westminster it is essential that Irish interests are protected that the economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.#We have commitments from our partners at an EU level that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and will be protected. Sinn Féin expects those commitments to be honoured and that is what we have been making clear to the Irish government and the EU.#There is no such thing as a good Brexit but the backstop is the bottom line. Anyone who imagines that can be unpicked or diluted or set aside isn#t dealing with the political realities. The DUP position on Brexit is reckless and irresponsible. It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland. I would urge all political leaders to act in the interests of workers, of communities, of society and political stability.”DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said that Mrs May should ask for and deliver changes to a Withdrawal Agreement. Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the EU, he saidthere are “no legally binding assurances” as the Prime Minister talked about in December.“In fact, there is nothing new, nothing has changed,” he said. “Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands, there has been no change to the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. I stead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"patricias latest work set to banish january blues with latest work","story":"MONDAY morning and a trip across the city to the old Belfast politan College on Tower Street ,whose beauty and hair salon is proving the perfect rehearsal space for Patricia Gormley’s latest work ‘Is That Too Hot ’Set in the world of hairdryers, rollers, straighteners and all things beauty, the hilarious sequel to ‘I’ll Tell My Ma’ is heading to The MAC stage this month to lt our spirits during the post-holiday slump.West Belfast scribe Patricia, who has performed her work across the city on many stages from the Cultúrlann to the Lyric, in her new play traces the antics of Granny Eileen, Davina Carina and Cha Marie as they stumble their way through another year in their ever turbulent lives as they pop in and out of their local hairdressers for a cuppa, a ‘curly blowdry’ and a catch-up.Starring Christina Nelson, who brought Patricia’s work and characters to le on the Lyric stage last year, and Roisin Gallagher, both actors told Daily Belfast how audiences are in for a treat when curtain comes up.“I play the character of Olive, in whose salon the stories of each character unfold in,” explained Roisin. “Olive has her own drama going on which the audience find out about throughout the piece. It is based on a real le person and hairdressers in the heart of West Belfast. It’s a brilliant observational piece and it’s a story about what happens at the heart of any community that has people who are lonely, struggling, having relationship problems and maybe don’t have anyone to speak to and are coming to this place for their own needs once a week. As Olive says in the play, “This place is like a psychiatrist’s couch, only they get to sit in a swivel chair. The character of Olive hears more about what is going on than the priest,” she laughed.Fresh from her stint as the white rabbit in the Lyric’s Alice the Musical, Christina Nelson is preparing to transform once again into a iety of roles for this sequel. “Granny Eileen, feisty as ever, is back, bless her, back from Turkey where she had a great old time. Cha Marie is back and Patricia has written a new character, Mrs Hughes, who is a bit of a prickly one and worth a watching.”Christina continued: “The energy with Roisin is brilliant, we are working brilliantly together and we are working our socks off to make sure those coming to see us will be laughing in their seats.“So much of everyday le is heard and discussed in the hairdressers, some people even just go to sit under the dryer to get a bit of heat, get a cup of tea brought to them. It’s very much a social thing and they are very much embedded throughout communities.”When asked about plans for a trilogy, Christina revealed that Patricia is “writing as we speak.” “Granny Eileen will definitely be back and there is more to come for these characters.”The new production will reunite Roisin with her recent Bah, Humbug! co-star Alan McKee, who this time will be sitting in the director’s chair. The former St Genevieve’s High School pupil will also be bringing her own work to The MAC stage in March with the self-penned Natural Disaster. “I wrote this piece, it’s what I would call a creative documentation, after my daddy passed away last Christmas. It’s like a journey through grief and I had documented things during that time that were said whether they were funny and sad. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, it’s how we look at grief, how we carry it with us and it will be great to perform it at The MAC following our run with this show.”“You can’t help but fall in love with these characters,” said Roisin. “It’s the perfect tonic for people needing a lt in January to put their worries away for an hour or two and come and see the show.”Is That Too Hot runs at The MAC from January  until February .

Northern Irelands economy and stability cant be sacriced because politicians in London have failed to recognise the obvious.\"Green Party leader Clare Bailey called for a Peoples Vote to \"push through the parliamentary impasse\".\"Westminster and Theresa Mays Government are in chaos, a Peoples Vote is a must,\" she said. \"The option to remain must be on the table as part of a Peoples Vote. The majority of people across Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU and the polls tell us that most people would swing to remaina vote happened tomorrow.\"TUV leader Jim Allister said he was \"delighted\" that the draft deal had been defeated.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem.

McGrady responded with a second point for Down, but Donegal piled on the agony and further scores from McGonigle, with a goal, Hugh McFadden and Oisin Gallen left the visitors comfortable winners.Down had late points from Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe, a member of the county U- squad last season, and Devlin, but they were mere consolation scores as Donegal ran out comfortable winners.Down: Jonathan Parr, Shane Annett, Ruairi Wells, Ryan McAleenan, Gerard Collins, Benny McArdle, Ryan Johnston , Aaron McClements, Daniel McCarthy, Rory Mason, Conor Poland, Jerome Johnston , Pat Havern , Ciaran Harney .Subs: Conor McGradyfor McArdle, Paul Devlinfor Mason, D McClements for Harney, Corey Quinn for Havern, Owen McCabefor Aaron McClements.Donegal: Martin McGinley, Caolan Ward, Brendan McCole, Conor Morrison, Eoin McHugh, Eamonn Doherty, Peadar Morgan , Hugh McFadden , Martin McElhinney , Ciaran Thompson , Niall OrsquoDonnell , Caolan McGonigle , Martin OrsquoReilly , Michael Langan , Jamie Brennan .Subs: Jason McGee for Thompson, Paul Brennan for McHugh, Lorcan Connor for Morrison, Oisin Gallenfor OrsquoReilly.Down -Donegal -McKENNA CUP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17344960.campaigner-says-walk-to-stormont-was-for-the-future-of-his-children/resources/images/9266732.jpg","title":"social media star to represent uk in performing arts olympics","story":"Oli Keenan, , from ClydebankldquoItrsquos amazing exposure to be able to go over there and perform in front of all these people you normally wouldnrsquot get the chance to here in ScotlandAs well as Olirsquos big break as Pennywise, over ChristmasThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The House of Commons has sent an unmistakable message to the Prime Minister and the European Union that this deal is rejected.“Mrs May will now be able to demonstrate to the Brussels’ negotiators that changes are requiredany deal is to command the support of Parliament.“We will work with the Government constructively to achieve a better deal. That is our focus. Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the Government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal.”Taking to Twitter after MPs voted, Ms O’Neill posted: “Brexit crisis has deepened further tonight. No Deal crash out is completely reckless  not in our peoples, households or businesses interests. Backstop is the bottom line and is not up for negotiation.”Mr Swann said the result of the vote in the House of Commons had been “inevitable and entirely predictable.”“The Prime Minister and the team around her have been trying to resurrect their doomed withdrawal agreement for weeks. They weren’t listening despite the will of Parliament, in opposition to this agreement, being clear for weeks,” he said.“Attempts to manipulate this vote to be a decision between a bad deal and no deal were desperate in the extreme and have clearly backfired resulting in an emphatic defeat for the Government.“Instead of more preication and reckless negotiating tactics the UK Government needs to recalibrate its negotiating position, grab this process by the scruff of the neck and seek an extension to Article . Then get the EU back to the negotiating table. The debate has clearly shown that there is no desire amongst the majority of MPs for a no deal Brexit.“The EU’s claims that they want to defend the Belfast Agreement must now be backed up by actions that reflect their responsibility. The backstop needs dealt with and they know it. If they continue with their present intransigence, everyone will end up in a place where no-one wants to go.”MPs reject Theresa May’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mrs Long said the margin of defeat for the government was “surprising”, adding: “Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit. The Brexit process has been defined by a flawed concept, incompatible red-lines, unrealistic expectations and imaginary solutions. Even today,  months on, there is still no clarity on what the UK wants in terms of Brexit.“Parliament last week rejected a no deal Brexit, recognising it would be disaster for the UK, and a catastrophe for Northern Ireland.“Now they have rejected the Withdrawal Agreement, despite the fact any negotiated Brexit will require a Withdrawal Agreement, including an open-ended, all weather backstop. This reality cannot be escaped or avoided. They have also comprehensively failed to offer any single alternative which commands a majority.“It is now clear the only coherent way forward is to have a People’s Vote. Democracy is an active process, and given what we now know and the ongoing deadlock, the people of UK must have the right to have their say.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood commented: “There is no such thing as a good Brexit butwe are forced to leave the EU then Northern Ireland must to be protected through a backstop.“The naive belief in Westminster that a better deal can be negotiated with Brussels is merely postponing the inevitable. That fact remains - there is no way to avoid a hard border in IrelandNorthern Ireland leaves the Customs Union and Single Market. That is why a backstop is essential. The SDLP have said this from day one. “Northern Ireland’s economy and stability can’t be sacriced because politicians in London have failed to recognise the obvious.”Reacting to the result of the vote on Twitter, TUV leader Jim Allister posted: “Mrs May’s treacherous deal gets its just deserts. It deserved no better. PM needs to present EU choice of ditch the Backstop or face No Deal. No more rollover.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

The Irish government will be expected to apply EU checks in full.”Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster has stated there was never a hard border between north and south.Ms Foster, said “there is no need for the backstop,” before pointing to the “fact that the Irish prime minister has indicated he will not be putting up a hard border on the island of Ireland”. “You know as someone who lived through the troubles, we never had a hard-border.

The DUP props up Theresa May’s minority Conservative government through a confidence and supply agreement. Mrs Foster spoke at a Brexiteer event in London which was also attended by former Brexit secretaries Dominic Raab and David Davis. try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

Coming from a messenger which the party doesn’t respect, the message carried little weight.As the prime minister talked about Northern Ireland from the despatch box last night, the DUP’s MPs muttered and shook their heads.Without radical changes to the backstop, there was never any prospect of the DUP recanting on its opposition to this deal.But in recent days there have been glimpses of the internal debate which is now going on within the DUP as to what may happen now.Last week chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said that the party would consider “with interest” a proposal to commit the government to end the backstop within a year. But the party’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, said that such a pledge was so pointless that “you could sign it in blood and it wouldn’t mean anything”.Yesterday both Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster repeated their opposition to a no-deal Brexit, yet a year ago DUP MP Ian Paisley talked bullishly about leaving without a deal.A cannier prime minister would have sought to exploit the DUP’s dferent wings, which take in everyone from closet Remainers to ardent Brexiteers.But throwing money at them, as was in December reported to be one government line of thinking, won’t work.If the party sees this as a constitutional threat to the Union – the defence of which is the DUP’s raison d’être – then the acceptance of money or peerages or any other practical ‘gt’ would make an already dficult sell to the party’s supporters almost impossible because it would look like they had quite literally sold out on their central principles.Despite Theresa May’s deal being routed, DUP will still back herDublin minister expects border checks after no deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.N.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

to Government sources.The Financial Times, meanwhile, reported Mr Hammond told those on the call the Government would not put any ldquoobstacles in the way of a plan by Tory MP Nick Boles to give

The Lurgan campus has long been regarded as wholly inadequate in terms of facilities.Parents at Monday night’s meeting voiced their opposition to the plans amid calls for the children from the Lurgan campus to be accommodated at Lurgan Junior High School in an - school - retaining academic selection at age  for pupils to move on to Lurgan College.Parents were warned ‘not to be bamboozled by figures’ after EA officials outlined the case for their proposals and their reasons for rejecting other alternatives.Indeed there were weary laughs of derision as EA official Michael McConkey outlined the advantages or the Portadown solution and the Lurgan option - with a much shorter list for the Lurgan case. One parent pointed out many of the points made in favour of Portadown could - and should - be included in the case for Lurgan.A former governor at Craigavon Senior High and also a governor at the junior High, Mr Tom McKay, questioned a £. million deficit that officials said the senior high was running at.Stressing he was speaking in a personal capacity he asked what proportion of that deficit was due to pupil fluctuations in a two year school, pointing out: “Some will be due to running a split site school, but not all.”He went on to say: “Running a two year school was always going to be a risky business.”He pointed to the effect fluctuating pupil numbers could have as they could lose  pupils in a year which could have a signicant impact on the school budget.He added: “You talk about moving pupils to Portadown but its still going to be a two year school, it is always going to be subject to times of stress.”One key point of the discussions with regard to the ‘Lurgan solution’ was the EA’s insistence on protecting the Dickson Plan - which sees academic selection delayed to age  in this area. Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The EA pointed to a statement made by DUP Education Minister Peter Weir on June ,  in defence of the Dickson Plan.He said at that time: “I want to assure people locally that I will be offering support and assurance for the continuation of the Dickson Plan system, and will be ushering in a period of educational stability on the issue. This is something that works, and so I will ensure that the Dickson Plan is not removed either directly or undermined through stealth, and that any threat is now lted.”Mr McKay: “We are paving over the cracks and stripping Lurgan of all these young people and all to satisfy the statement of a minister.“To say creating an - school in Lurgan could be perceived as weakening the Dickson Plan - that is very suspect. I support the Dickson Plan in as far as the Dickson Plan is selection at . This is not a detraction from the Dickson Plan.”It was a point which struck a definite chord with those at the meeting who applauded his remarks. He added the Dickson Plan did need to be changed with the colleges in Lurgan and Portadown taking more than the average number of pupils while the senior high school pupils were the “most vulnerable in society.”He commended the work done by the teachers at the senior high: “If it wasn’t for their hard work it would have failed long ago.”Another parent pointed to Peter Weir’s remarks and said: “Do not hold us to ransom for a man who was in a government that doesn’t exist anymore.”A number of speakers articulated the Lurgan solution while other expressed their practical concerns over bussing children to Portadown - especially from outlying villages.One pointed out: “A review is being carried out which could see bus passes taken away so it could cost you £ a year to get a child to a school you did not choose.”The EA officials stated the consultation was the start of the process rather than the end but a decision would be based on educational considerations rather than weight of numbers.try catch  TrendingOutrage as dirty needles found near play areaPolice hunt lsquoMike Tysonrsquo wannabe after manrsquos ear bitten in attackDamaged roof leads to part of Craigavon shopping centre being cordoned offBoyarrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school arrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school\"Shock and disbelief after kids fire massive kne at door of family home          ..

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
