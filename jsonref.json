Photograph: Dave PettardPA WireThe centre-ground Alliance Party is making significant headway in the local elections in Northern Ireland while the DUP saw its first openly gay candidate elected to office.As counting resumed on Saturday, the DUP and Sinn Féin were holding their own as the two dominant parties in Northern Ireland, while the SDLP appeared to be performing reasonably well.The Green Party, which won four seats in the 2014 local elections, also seemed set to make gains. The Ulster Unionist Party, which won 88 seats in 2014, appeared to be under pressure although with the vagaries of the proportional representation, single transferable vote system, how it and the other parties perform will not be clear until later on Saturday. The two big stories of the count on Friday were the election of the DUP’s Alison Bennington to Newtownabbey Borough Council and the significant gains made by Alliance.The DUP’s decision to stand Ms Bennington, who is gay, in the Glengormley area of the council prompted criticism from some Protestant fundamentalist supporters of the party. However, party headquarters resisted the pressure and she won a seat.Welcoming her election, DUP leader Arlene Foster said it did not necessarily indicate a shift in the party’s opposition to same-sex marriage.Asked what was the significance of Ms Bennington’s win, Ms Foster told BBC Radio Ulster: “I think it sends out a clear signal that we are open to everyone who wants to protect the union and is prepared to sign up to our policies and objectives.”The Alliance party won 32 seats in 2014 with just under 7 per cent of the vote. While a number of electoral wards are still to be counted, the party’s overall vote was up by about 5 per cent. “It has been a very good election so far and our return of seats could be in the high 30s or early 40s,” predicted one senior party source. TalksThe Irish and British governments will be studying the results for any indications that the talks they are hosting to restore Stormont beginning on Tuesday might be successful. Ms Foster said she believed voters wanted the Northern Executive and Assembly reinstated. There was some hope that the public reaction to the New IRA murder of journalist and writer Lyra McKee might spur the DUP and Sinn Féin, in particular, to strike a deal in these talks to bring back the powersharing administration.Ms Foster said her party would “not be found wanting” in seeking to end the political stalemate. “We are a devolutionist party, we want to see devolution returned to Northern Ireland,” she said.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the election results had demonstrated that the political deadlock was unacceptable.In the election, there were 819 candidates standing for 462 seats on the North’s 11 councils, six with unionist majorities and four with nationalist majorities, and Alliance holding the balance of power in Belfast. Among the councillors elected so far was Kyle Black, who was returned for the DUP to Mid Ulster. His prison officer father, David Black, was murdered by the New IRA in 2012. Mr Black said his father was a huge influence on his life.“The reason why I got involved in politics is that I want to play my part in moving Northern Ireland towards being a truly peaceful society that thrives economically, culturally and socially and offers opportunities,” he told BBC Radio Ulster."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3880306.1556909600!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"enforcer asked fai for records days after auditors queried accounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe watchdog is investigating the FAI after it emerged   its chief executive John Delaney gave the association a €100,000 loan to cover a cash shortfall at the organisation in 2017The State’s corporate law watchdog has asked the High Court to decide whether documents handed over by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in a sealed envelope are legally protected from being accessed.The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) wants the court to determine if certain materials sought from the FAI, and supplied earlier this week, are subject to “legal privilege”.The watchdog asked the sports association for a range of records on Friday, April 19th – three days after it emerged that the FAI’s auditors Deloitte had told the Companies Registration Office that it had contravened two sections of the Companies Act, including a failure to keep proper books of account.The regulator made the application to the court as it engages with Irish soccer’s governing body on “certain matters”, ODCE lawyer Claire O’Regan said in a sworn statement to the court.Cash shortfallThe watchdog is investigating the FAI after it emerged that its chief executive John Delaney gave the association a €100,000 loan to cover a cash shortfall at the organisation in 2017.Mr Delaney resigned as chief executive over concerns raised about the FAI’s finances and took up the role of executive vice president before later stepping aside from that position.The controversy also led to the resignations of FAI’s honorary secretary Michael Cody and honorary treasurer Eddie Murray, two external reviews and the suspension of public funding from Sport Ireland.In a brief hearing before Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds at the High Court on Friday, lawyers for the ODCE said that its application relates to “potentially legally privileged material”.The court was told that the watchdog issued a production order requiring the FAI under company law to hand over a wide range of books and documents, including the minutes of all meetings of the FAI board of directors and committees of the board dating from January 1st, 2016 to March 21st, 2019.On Wednesday, the FAI handed over material to the ODCE including documents in an envelope marked “privileged material” that remains sealed.Potential breachesThe ODCE stopped short of telling the court the reasons why it had asked the FAI to produce such a large volume of information.The application was made under the Companies Act, 2014 that gives the director powers to issue the production order if he considers there are circumstances suggesting a possible offence among a list of 11 potential breaches of company law, including fraudulent conduct by a company and unlawful conduct by an officer of the company.A spokesman for the FAI declined to comment on these potential offences. He said that the association was aware of the ODCE application, acknowledges that it is part of an ongoing process and continued to co-operate fully.The ODCE, which told the FAI about its application in advance, wants a legally qualified person to examine the material and prepare a report for the court.Ms Justice Reynolds adjourned the matter to Tuesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3880250.1556906259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"racing industry wants quick brexit deal for movement of horses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Punchestown Festival on Friday where two industry representatives met  the agriculture counsellor at the Irish permanent representation to the EU in Brussels. Photograph: PA WirePoliticians should not allow Brexit negotiations slip to the October 31st deadline to agree a EU-UK orce deal, representatives of the Irish and British horseracing industries have warned.The industry is concerned that if the withdrawal agreement is not signed off until the latest deadline in the deadlocked process around the UK’s departure from the EU, then the consequences of a much-reduced transition period will jeopardise free movement of horses between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit.Speaking at the Punchestown racing festival this week, Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, and Will Lambe, executive director of the British Horseracing Authority, urged British politicians to agree on a EU-UK orce deal quickly to maximise the transition period to secure a trade deal.A tripartite agreement, currently in operation under EU law, permits the movement of and trade in horses between Ireland, Britain and France without veterinary inspections or health certificates.‘Terms of exit’“The deal that is on the table is not a deal but is the terms of exit. Of course we want to know what does the trade deal look like, what role does the horse sector have within that,” Mr Lambe said. “The agricultural element of that deal will be the hardest. The sooner we can move on to those discussions the better.”Mr Kavanagh said he hoped politicians would agree a deal as soon as possible because if it was left until September or October, that would leave just 14 or 15 months of a transition period, under the agreement, which was “not a long time in terms of getting EU law ready”.While attending the Punchestown festival, the two industry representatives met Breffni Carpenter, the agriculture counsellor at the Irish permanent representation to the EU in Brussels. ‘Third country’ statusConcerns about the movement of horses post-Brexit receded last month when the UK was granted “third country” status by the EU for the export of live animals, though this would not fully remove barriers to the seamless movement of racehorses and breeding stock if there was no deal agreed. Mr Kavanagh said there were still concerns about the movement of horses from a “third country” as it would be impossible to apply for the movement of horses North and South across the Border.“For example, horses that are coming here from Northern Ireland in a post-Brexit situation should be isolated from the other horses, according to the letter of the law,” he said. “What happens then? Do they race on the right hand side of the track as opposed to the left? We want to get into that sort of discussion rather than the endless arguing over the orce.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3880460.1556922832!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cheap flights slated at debate for european election candidates","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClaire Daly: ‘We cannot have unfettered aviation development in Dublin.’ File photograph: The  The expansion of Dublin airport and cheap European flights were criticised at a public debate on climate issues with European Parliament candidates. Airport operator DAA is in talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to raise a several “hundred million” euro to part fund its capital expenditure plan which extends to 2024.At a briefing on its annual results on Tuesday, the company, which controls Dublin and Cork Airports, said it expected to receive additional debt funding in the next 12-24 months to help finance its €1 billion plan to increase capacity on its campus.The Environmental Pillar held a public debate to gauge where European Parliament candidates stand on key environmental and climate issues in Dublin on Friday evening.Green Party European Parliament candidate Ciarán Cuffe was critical of the expansion of Dublin Airport and said more sustainable forms of travel are needed to tackle climate change. “The DAA is looking for over €200 million for the expansion of Dublin Airport when we don’t apparently have money to tackle the housing crisis. Cities in Spain are getting EIB funding for housing but it seems like Ireland only wants it for expanding airports. That’s not on,” said Mr Cuffe. Opposed to second runway“We have to tackle aviation fuel and the impact is it having on the environment . . . we can’t go on with €5.99 flights from Dublin to Spain,” he said. Independents 4 Change candidate Claire Daly said she has long opposed the decision to open a second runway at Dublin Airport. “The second runway . . . is going to have a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of residents in the area,”said Ms Daly. “We cannot have unfettered aviation development in Dublin. It’s unsustainable from a traffic point of view . . . bringing people to Dublin when there are other airports in the country. It is also unsustainable because people are getting up in the middle of the night to get cheap flights to get to Spain to facilitate the airlines going in and going out.”The debate was also attended by Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, Independent Senator Alice-Mary Higgins,Green Party candidate Ciarán Cuffe, Workers’ Party candidate Ellis Ryan, Social Democrats candidate Gary Gannon, Labour Party candidate Alex White, Fianna Fáil candidate Barry Andrews, People Before Profit candidate Gillian Brien and Fine Gael candidate Mark Durkan.

He ran as a candidate for the DUP in the Carntogher electoral ward.Counting in the elections centres began at 8am on Friday with election centres likely to be working until late on Saturday before it is known which candidates fill the 462 seats on the North’s 11 councils.Derry ‘resurgence’SDLP leader Colum Eastwood claimed Northern Ireland was witnessing the party’s resurgence after it topped the poll in two of the District Electoral Areas (DEAs) in Derry.First-time candidate Mary Durkan polled more than 1,200 first preference votes in Foyleside and was elected on the first count.In Ballyarnett, Angela Dobbins was also elected on the first count with almost 1,400 first preference votes.The SDLP lost one seat to Rachael Ferguson of the Alliance Party - which won its first seat in Derry in almost 40 years - leaving the SDLP with a net gain of one seat.Shaun Harkin, who was elected for People Before Profit in the Foyleside District Electoral Area (DEA), is the party’s first councillor in Derry.Counting has moved on to the third stage in four of the seven DEAs in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area, with no other candidates so far elected.The remainder of the DEAs will be counted on Saturday.In Belfast, the SDLP’s Paul McCusker topped the poll in the Oldpark DEA with 2,856 votes, more than 1,200 votes over the quota of 1,619.“It’s early days for us in terms of the renewal project,” Mr Eastwood said, “but what we’re finding across the North is that in places where we run new, young, talented candidates and put a good campaign behind them we can win seats.“We have an awful lot of work to do across the North. There are large parts of the North where we need to put a lot of effort in, but we know what the formula is and we’re going to multiply it.Mr Eastwood refused to be drawn on whether Ms Durkan would be a potential candidate for the next Westminster election.Ms Durkan, who is a solicitor, is the sister of the SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan and the niece of the former Foyle MP Mark Durkan, who is now standing for Fine Gael in the European elections in Dublin.Sinn Féin had previously held 16 seats in the DCSDC council area, and the SDLP eight. There were seven DUP councillors, seven Independents, and two Ulster Unionists.In Ballyarnett retired GP Anne McCloskey is polling strongly for the all-Ireland anti-abortion party Aontú and is expected to be elected.There is also speculation that Rachael Ferguson in the Faughan ward could take the first Alliance seat in Derry since 1981.Among those already eliminated include Martin McGuinness’s former special adviser, Conor Heaney, who stood in the Faughan ward.Two sitting councillors – Gus Hastings of the SDLP and Thomas Kerrigan of the DUP – have lost their seats.TurnoutJust over 1.3 million were entitled to vote in this proportional representation, single transferable vote election. Turnout was said to be steady at the polling stations throughout Thursday with the total poll expected to be close to or on a par with the 51 per cent turnout at the last local elections in 2014.The DUP with 172 ran the most candidates. Sinn Féin stood 155 candidates, the Ulster Unionist Party 117, the SDLP 85 and Alliance 84.Sinn Féin topped the poll with 153,000 votes followed by the DUP on 145,000 in 2014. The transfer system worked in favour of the DUP who ended up with 130 seats while Sinn Féin won 105. The UUP was third winning 102,000 votes and taking 88 seats, with the SDLP on 85,000 votes and winning 66 seats. The Alliance on 42,000 votes won 32 seats.The Traditional Unionist Voice did best of the smaller parties winning 13 seats on a vote of 28,000.The smaller parties such as the Greens, People Before Profit and the Progressive Unionist Party will be hoping to increase their vote and number of councillors.The 11 council areas in Northern Ireland are: Antrim and Newtownabbey Ards and North Down Armagh Banbridge and Craigavon Belfast City Causeway Coast and Glens Derry and Strabane Fermanagh and Omagh Lisburn and Castlereagh Mid and East Antrim Mid Ulster and Newry Mourne and Down.

File photograph: Rui VieiraPA Wire A dead heat between two parties in one ward in Bradford during local elections in the UK led to the winning candidate being chosen by drawing lots.Labour’s Kausar Mukhtar and the Green Party’s Matt Edwards received an equal number of votes for the Tong ward seat.The decision was taken to draw lots after three recounts could not separate the two candidates.The deciding vote went to Ms Mukhtar, with 743 votes to Mr Edwards’s 742.Joanne Hyde, deputy returning officer for Bradford Council, said: “When two or more candidates have the same number of votes, then we must decide between the candidates by lots.“That’s called an equality of votes situation. Whichever candidate wins the lot, it’s treated as though they have an additional vote.”Ms Hyde said she drew the winning vote, observed by the candidates, from a box containing one Labour ballot and one Green party ballot.Ms Mukhtar’s victory means the Labour Party held the Tong ward. The seat was previously held by Tess Peart, who did not stand for re-election. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3880356.1556917030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk local elections conservative losses heap pressure on may","story":"British prime minister Theresa May was heckled at the Welsh Conservative party conference, as early results showed that voters had punished the Conservatives and Labour Party in local elections.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“I think there was a simple message from yesterday’s elections to both us and the Labour Party – just get on and deliver Brexit.” Photograph: Nigel RoddisPA WireTheresa May faced renewed calls to resign on Friday night after the Conservatives lost more than 1,200 seats in local elections in England, losing control of more than 40 councils. The prime minister was heckled as she spoke to Welsh Conservatives, as a party activist shouted “why don’t you resign?” and “we don’t want you”.Veteran backbencher Michael Fabricant described Mrs May’s leadership as a cancer in the party that had to be removed before it could recover. “The cancer in the Conservative Party must now be excised so that the party can revive in time for our conference at the end of September with a new leader and clean break from the EU. The Withdrawal Agreement is unlikely to achieve this with its ties to Brussels,” he said.The Conservatives lost seats throughout the parts of England where the elections were held, losing control of councils including Peterborough, St Albans and Basildon.“These were always going to be difficult elections for us with us nine years into a government. Of course there is the added dimension we haven’t got the Brexit deal over the line,” Mrs May told Sky News.“But of course it wasn’t a good night for Labour either – they were predicting they would make gains but they have lost over 100 seats. I think there has been a very clear message from people to both main parties that they want us to get on and deliver Brexit, so I welcome comments from Jeremy Corbyn that he thinks we should be working to ensure we can deliver a deal.”Labour had hoped to gain at least 400 seats but instead lost dozens and lost control of a number of councils, including Bolsover in Derbyshire, the political base of long-serving MP Dennis Skinner. The party lost seats both in parts of the country that backed Brexit in 2016 and in places that voted to remain in the EU.Labour MPs who favour a second Brexit referendum claimed the party was paying the price for its ambiguous policy and for working with the government to agree a common approach to Brexit.Big gainsThe Liberal Democrats made big gains, recovering much of the ground they lost in 2015 when voters punished them for their role in coalition with the Conservatives.The Liberal Democrats gained more than 600 seats, more than doubling the number of councils under their control. The Green Party, which also favours a second referendum, increased its number of council seats from a few dozen to almost 300 in its best ever result.Neither Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party nor the anti-Brexit Change UK formed by MPs who defected from the Conservatives and Labour, contested the local elections but they will take part in European Parliament elections on May 23rd.Environment secretary Michael Gove said voters were clearly angry about the impasse over Brexit and had sent the same message to both the Conservatives and Labour.“I think, in a way, that whatever else one takes from these local elections – and there are reasons for sadness when good councillors lose their seats – one lesson that we can take is that the electorate has pretty clearly said to both major parties: ‘Get on with it’. My view is that the message is more acute for Labour because the overwhelming majority of Conservative MPs have supported the prime minister but only a tiny fraction of the Labour Party have. But the responsibility rests on all us in Westminster to respect that result,” he said.\u0026nbsp– Additional reporting: PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3879911.1556906253!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk local elections liberal democrats take tory strongholds","story":"British prime minister Theresa May was heckled at the Welsh Conservative party conference, as early results showed that voters had punished the Conservatives and Labour Party in local elections.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable addresses the media with activists outside Chelmsford City Council Civic Centre. Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesVince Cable has hailed his Liberal Democrats party as “the big winners” of the local election, with the party gaining hundreds of seats and a series of councils.With 232 of the 248 councils tallied up, the Lib Dems had won 1,179 seats, a net gain of 571 in an election set to be Mr Cable’s swansong in charge.At that point in the counting, the Conservatives had lost 1,048 seats, and Labour 72, while the Greens had gained 153 seats and independents 183.However, the Liberal Democrats’ success should be put in the context of disastrous results the last time the same areas were fought.Among the areas taken were the traditional Tory stronghold of Cotswold district council, where they overtook the Conservatives to become the biggest single party, winning 18 of the 34 seats.Arguably more striking was Bath and north-east Somerset, where the Lib Dems gained 23 seats to easily overturn the previous Tory majority, winning 37 of the 59 seats – including the home ward of Tory Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.As the results came in, Mr Cable opted to travel to Chelmsford in Essex, where his party overturned a previous 45-seat Conservative majority, amassing a net gain of 26 seats, while the Tories lost 31.The party also gained Winchester, Vale of White Horse, Hinckley and Bosworth, North Devon and North Norfolk. They also took the newly-formed authority of Somerset West and Taunton, formed by the merger of two other councils.‘Big winners’Mr Cable told celebrating Liberal Democrats activists that the result reflected a “story across the country”. He said: “The Lib Dems were written off at one point but we’re coming back very, very strongly. We’re the big winners of the night throughout the country.”Mr Cable added: “Today’s Lib Dem surge is a springboard to the European elections, where we are clearly the strongest remain force on the ballot paper. Every Liberal Democrat vote on May 23rd will be a vote to stop Brexit. ”However, the result seemed to have a broader impetus than just Brexit, with analysis showing the party only did slightly better in remain-voting areas than those which supported leave in 2016. Chelmsford, perhaps the most dramatic Lib Dem gain, supported leave in the referendum.The other context is that the Lib Dems had been widely expected to gain seats given than the last time the same councils were fought was May 2015, when the party was being roundly punished by voters following the Conservatives-Lib Dem coalition.Then, the Lib Dems lost more than 400 seats and four councils. In the general election on the same day the party slumped from 57 Westminster seats to eight.Under pressureMeanwhile, Conservative councillors and MPs have called for prime minister Theresa May to step down after the party lost more than 1,000 seats.Council leaders called for the prime minister to consider her position while others said they had made gains despite the government’s paralysis since the 2016 EU referendum. A heckler interrupted Mrs May as she gave a speech in Wales, saying: “Why don’t you resign? We don’t want you.”The Conservative group leader, Tony Berry, said it was a “very unusual set of circumstances” because of Brexit and “professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country”.Delivering a message to the prime minister, he said: “I would ask her to consider her position very carefully.”In Bath and North East Somerset, where Tory losses included the council leader, Tim Warren, who said councillors had been “given a kicking for something that wasn’t our fault”.Asked whether there needed to be changes in leadership or policies at the top of the party, Mr Warren replied: “There needs to be a change in action.”Other home counties losses for the Conservatives include Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Folkestone \u0026amp Hythe, St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield.A succession of pro-leave Tories called on Friday morning for Mrs May to step down. The MP Crispin Blunt said the party needed to replace Mrs May with a new leader.“I’ve been trying to get her out openly since December. Lots of people are trying to get the message over.”Good newsIn a rare piece of good news for Mrs May, the Conservatives took control of Walsall council after winning seats from Labour, having run the authority for a year without a majority.The council leader, Mike Bird, said they had won “despite” the Conservative government and Theresa May.“She hasn’t helped us make any gains at all – far from it – we made the gains despite the prime minister,” he said.Despite some predictions that Jeremy Corbyn’s party could pick up three-figure gains, Labour were unable to capitalise on the Conservatives’ struggles. Labour was down more than 70 seats, though it did have the consolation of restoring control in Trafford for the first time sine 2003."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignLine of Duty actor has lucky escape after truck \u0026#39crashes into his taxi\u0026#39 Ruth Davidson: no more \u0026#39constitutional games\u0026#39 if I become First MinisterSajid Javid warns Tories have lost voters trust because they have failed to deliver BrexitGavin Williamson sacking row continues as Sir Mark Sedwill accused of refusing to investigate troop numbers leakBBC writer complains about Amazon streaming drama worldwide Five takeaways from the local election results and why they bode well for Farage\u0026#39s Brexit partyComment: These disastrous local elections could be a blessing in disguise for the ConservativesRevealed: How the new Emperor of Japan went to the ball with a young British diplomatPremier League footballers running out of luxury mansions to buy Local Elections results 2019: Who won in your local council area and how the vote maps out nationallyLocal elections 2019: Tories lose more than 1,200 seats in worst performance since 1995 -

It’s so wrong.”Amazon’s UK logistics arm paid just £4.6 million in corporation tax in the year ending December 2017, despite its operating profit growing to £79 million. The company’s tax arrangements are entirely legal but it is regularly criticised. It has previously said that it pays “all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate”.Davies’ new BBC One project is Years and Years, a drama starring Emma Thompson as a populist politician. It is likely to prove controversial, set in a near future in which Donald Trump threatens nuclear war against China.The writer said the BBC had placed no limits on what he could say about the US president.“They knew what they were getting – a bold and risky piece,” he said. “Actually, they knew it couldn’t be any madder than the real world.”Years and Years begins on May 14. The nightmarish political events are seen through the eyes of one family in Manchester.Read the full Russell T Davies interview from Saturday at 0700Please review our commenting policyLine of Duty actor has lucky escape after truck \u0026#39crashes into his taxi\u0026#39 Ruth Davidson: no more \u0026#39constitutional games\u0026#39 if I become First MinisterSajid Javid warns Tories have lost voters trust because they have failed to deliver BrexitGavin Williamson sacking row continues as Sir Mark Sedwill accused of refusing to investigate troop numbers leakFive takeaways from the local election results and why they bode well for Farage\u0026#39s Brexit partyComment: These disastrous local elections could be a blessing in disguise for the ConservativesRevealed: How the new Emperor of Japan went to the ball with a young British diplomatPremier League footballers running out of luxury mansions to buy Local Elections results 2019: Who won in your local council area and how the vote maps out nationallyLocal elections 2019: Tories lose more than 1,200 seats in worst performance since 1995 - follow results liveComment: Voters can smell the arrogance of the Remain zealots Michael Gove: I\u0026#39ve not \u0026#39gone soft\u0026#39 over Brexit but hardline Leavers need to \u0026#39face facts\u0026#39 over no-dealDonald Trump says he discussed \u0026#39Russia hoax\u0026#39 with Putin - but didn\u0026#39t raise election meddlingUK \u0026#39aware of  FBI approach to Trump campaign adviser in London before 2016 election\u0026#39Florida votes to allow teachers to carry weapons in the classroomSocial media firms should face levy to pay schools for teaching children traumatised online, say head teachers\u0026#39 leadersComment: If the local elections are any guide, we\u0026#39re heading for a Labour-SNP coalition\u0026#39Maverick\u0026#39 doctor used experimental cancer treatment on 10 patients who died, inquest to hearVoting arrangements for blind people are unlawful, rules high courtPoisonous caterpillars that can cause asthma attacks have spread inland for the first timeComment: Local elections: Labour struggle is Tories\u0026#39 only silver lining, but don\u0026#39t be fooled by Lib Dems\u0026#39 riseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000195951711_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britains nuclear deterrent cost five times official mod estimate","story":"CND protesters demonstrate outside Westminster Abbey, ahead of the Duke of Cambridge attending a service to recognise fifty years of continuous deterrent at sea in his capacity as Commodore-in-Chief of the Submarine Service.

Estate agents say the desire for swimming pools, large gardens and modern houses is a key reason why the county is struggling to keep up with footballers hunting for a new home.Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose girlfriend is Perrie Edwards of pop group Little Mix, joined Liverpool from Arsenal for £35 million in August 2017.The England international told The  he was forced to live in a hotel for two months while he struggled to find a Cheshire home. The 25-year-old would often see Everton footballer Gylfi Sigurdsson at breakfast.An aerial view of the Cheshire village of Alderley Edge, a long-time favourite with Premier League footballers One reason for the clamour for rental properties in Cheshire is because many footballers are wary about buying since they do not know how long they will be at a club.The battle between newly transferred footballers over the few high-end properties left in the area kicks off at the beginning of summer, when the recruitment process starts for the region’s biggest clubs.Oxlade-Chamberlain, who spent seven years at Arsenal, swapped the sprawling London property market for one of the most compact, exclusive areas in the country where the rental market is “incredibly competitive”, estate agent Peter Higham said.Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pictured with his girlfriend Perrie Edwards  He has been selling properties in Cheshire for 30 years for Gasgoine Hallman estate agents and added: “The rental market in Cheshire is competitive because the owners of these large luxury properties very rarely want to rent them out, usually opting to sell them.“Footballers also tend to want a very specific type of property – they want the modern technology, they want the pool, the security and the large garden.“You would not see the modern footballer buying a 1930s red brick – they want it new and bespoke.”Mr Higham said the struggle to find many footballers the ideal Cheshire home was also down to football’s changing culture.“When I first started dealing with footballers, they were all purchasing property because their agents wanted them to get settled in the area,” he said. “But because the modern footballer very rarely stays at one club for more than a few years, the agents are telling them to rent – because they could be somewhere else in a few years’ time.“If you think of the old-school footballer, he would have stayed in town for five years or more. It’s not like that any more.”It can cost as much as £15,000 per month to rent a property, with many footballers seeking the Alderley Edge area. Described as a “small, picturesque village”, it is popular with Manchester United players and was once home to David and Victoria Beckham.The average price for a detached house in Alderley Edge is nearly £1  million, but there is a very limited number of properties due to greenbelt planning restrictions.  Please review our commenting policyLine of Duty actor has lucky escape after truck \u0026#39crashes into his taxi\u0026#39 Ruth Davidson: no more \u0026#39constitutional games\u0026#39 if I become First MinisterSajid Javid warns Tories have lost voters trust because they have failed to deliver BrexitGavin Williamson sacking row continues as Sir Mark Sedwill accused of refusing to investigate troop numbers leakBBC writer complains about Amazon streaming drama worldwide Five takeaways from the local election results and why they bode well for Farage\u0026#39s Brexit partyComment: These disastrous local elections could be a blessing in disguise for the ConservativesRevealed: How the new Emperor of Japan went to the ball with a young British diplomatLocal Elections results 2019: Who won in your local council area and how the vote maps out nationallyLocal elections 2019: Tories lose more than 1,200 seats in worst performance since 1995 - follow results liveComment: Voters can smell the arrogance of the Remain zealots Michael Gove: I\u0026#39ve not \u0026#39gone soft\u0026#39 over Brexit but hardline Leavers need to \u0026#39face facts\u0026#39 over no-dealDonald Trump says he discussed \u0026#39Russia hoax\u0026#39 with Putin - but didn\u0026#39t raise election meddlingUK \u0026#39aware of  FBI approach to Trump campaign adviser in London before 2016 election\u0026#39Florida votes to allow teachers to carry weapons in the classroomSocial media firms should face levy to pay schools for teaching children traumatised online, say head teachers\u0026#39 leadersComment: If the local elections are any guide, we\u0026#39re heading for a Labour-SNP coalition\u0026#39Maverick\u0026#39 doctor used experimental cancer treatment on 10 patients who died, inquest to hearVoting arrangements for blind people are unlawful, rules high courtPoisonous caterpillars that can cause asthma attacks have spread inland for the first timeComment: Local elections: Labour struggle is Tories\u0026#39 only silver lining, but don\u0026#39t be fooled by Lib Dems\u0026#39 riseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000195586240_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaG6dAk39c_GK7MJr9zpjzeWC8awOkgp6n3s-glkxCWA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"revealed new emperor japan went ball young british diplomat","story":"Crown Prince Naruhito in his dormitory room at Oxford University in September 1985University of OxfordIt was an extraordinary assignment.

That represents an improvement on the previous month in which the sector shrank, recording 48.9.\u0026nbspBut as a recovery it’s about powerful as a broken down lawn mower engine.It’s de rigueur in any discussion\u0026nbspof economic data to provide a point of context. In the case of this one, the last two months represent the weakest performance signalled by this dataset for six years. \u0026nbspCarney, however, said he believed that surveys like this one may be over stating “Brexit uncertainty”. An example of the Bank being infected by the Brexiteer disease that holds that you’re a bally traitor if you display anything other than mindless optimism about their crazy project?\u0026nbspThat’s pushing it. Carney merely thinks investors are being too dovish and that even a modest improvement in the UK’s outlook would require remedial action from the central bank. Anything above 1.5 per cent - which would hardly put the UK in the class of the Jaguar cars that won’t be being made here for much longer - would do it. \u0026nbspThis, he thinks, is a realistic prospect if the Brexit impasse is finally resolved. He\u0026nbspalso appears to be ruling out a no deal.\u0026nbspHe may very well be guilty of underestimating the depths to which the Tory Party is prepared to sink. Perhaps it’s because he most often talks to Philip Hammond, who is on it’s semi sensible wing.Regardless, savers shouldn\u0027t get too excited about an improvement on the dismal returns they\u0027re currently getting.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, tweeted a couple of important points upon their release. He produced a graph showing that the official GDP data has erged somewhat from the PMI recently, which does happen every now and again.\u0026nbspBut long term they’re quite closely aligned and he noted that it would be “highly unusual for the economy to at least not lose substantial momentum when the PMI has sunk to current levels for more than one month”. The services sector accounts for 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s output, covering everything from City banks to the small dry cleaners where their employees\u0026nbsptake their suits.\u0026nbspThe uncertainty is there.

On the table was a bottle of wine. When they ordered a second, there was an audible ripple of admiration around the room. Fellow diners smiled in their direction.\u0026nbspThis scene unfolded recently in a City restaurant. Indeed, the two men looked as if they had met for a bit of a stockbroker reunion, to reminisce about their share trading, and lunching, days.\u0026nbspHardly anyone has a “two bottler” any more. Not at lunch on a work day. One bottle is rare, but a couple –\u0026nbspthat is going some.\u0026nbspEven a glass of wine is relatively scarce. If I look through my diary of a month’s worth of business lunches, those where the other person had a glass (like many, I no longer drink at lunchtime) amount to just a handful.\u0026nbspIn most workplaces today, drinking during working hours is frowned upon, as is consuming enough alcohol in the evening so that your breath smells of it the following morning. Doing the latter once may be okay\u0026nbspdo it twice or more, and you will be marked down as having “a problem”.\u0026nbspLloyd’s of London bans drink and drugs in the workplaceTimes have changed enormously since I started out, first in the City, then in media. Back then, and we’re talking more than three decades ago, it was standard to head to the nearest wine bar or the pub, and polish off a few glasses of wine or pints of beer before returning to your desk and attempting to work.\u0026nbspSometimes, as a junior, you felt obliged to keep your end up, so when the partners at my law firm, all male, lined up another bottle I would gulp and go along with it. Likewise, as a journalist, you occasionally had to go with the flow\u0026nbspas part of the job.\u0026nbspOne of the booziest lunches I ever had was with Crispin Odey, the hedge fund magnate. When I arrived to interview him at Corrigan’s –\u0026nbspthe super-smart Mayfair restaurant of star chef Richard Corrigan –\u0026nbspI was treated like royalty. Odey was running slightly late, and I was shown to a prime table. The staff bustled around, checking I was okay\u0026nbspnothing was too much for them. Finally\u0026nbsphe arrived, and they went into overdrive.A bottle of normally exquisite –\u0026nbspand expensive –\u0026nbspwhite Burgundy was produced, which Odey decided was not quite right. The sommelier scurried away to fetch another one. Odey glanced at the menu and knew what he wanted: a duck egg to start, followed by, if I agreed, a shared steak and kidney pie. “And what about some beef on the side, let’s have the loin of beef on the side. Lovely. Oh, and we’d better have some mash and some kale –\u0026nbspwe ought to have something green.”He called over the wine waiter again: “And we’d like a bottle of the Leoville.” The Leoville Barton was superb, as was the food. This was mid-week. A bottle of white, and a bottle of red. Beef on the side. Even back then, nobody had lunch like this, not any more, not in oh-so politically correct, watching-the-calories, London. Not on this scale, and even more rarely, at this cost. What’s more, with Odey, there was the feeling this was nothing special. The office of his firm, Odey Asset Management, was across the road, and Corrigan’s might as well have been his canteen.As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible, and started to angle down the page,\u0026nbspuntil the words trailed off completelySo, when I read an interview this week with veteran advertising boss Rory Sutherland, I was drawn to his statement that his industry is inordinately less boozy than it was: “Mind you, everything is less boozy. It was pretty routine at lunchtime to see people in the street outside a pub at 2.30 necking pints. It was also routine in advertising, which I always thought was a good thing which we shouldn’t have lost.”Sutherland was reminiscing in the same month that Lloyd’s of London has issued a new stern code of conduct to the 40,000 pass holders at its Leadenhall Street headquarters. From now on, anyone thought to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be refused entry. This, from what was regarded for its 331 year existence as the high temple of lunchtime boozing.\u0026nbspWho is right, who is wrong? Lloyd’s move was motivated by claims of sexual harassment and bad, laddish behaviour. It effectively signals the end for what was known euphemistically in the City as “liquid negotiations” or what Brexiteer Nigel Farage, a former broker, refers to as PFLs\u0026nbsp– “proper f***ing lunches”.\u0026nbspLike Nigel, I enjoyed my PFLs. Like Rory, too, I look back at them with fondness.\u0026nbspBut I also have to ask myself:\u0026nbspapart from spending what, over the years, would have amounted to a considerable sum of money, piling on the calories, and making me feel terrible the rest of the day, what did they actually achieve? Of course, they fostered camaraderie, of the loud, male, kind.\u0026nbspI also\u0026nbspsaw, though, far too many careers and lives ruined by what began as the odd PFL turning into a daily occurrence. A liquid lunch would then be replicated by something similar in the evening, every evening. One of\u0026nbsp those, doubtless, was Guy Farage, a City trader and alcoholic\u0026nbspwho abandoned the family home and his son, Nigel, then aged five.\u0026nbspDid any good come from them? I would venture, not where progress at work was concerned. I attempted to fire questions at Odey. As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible\u0026nbspand started to angle down the page, until the words trailed off completely. I had to finish the interview when I was sober.\u0026nbspLloyd’s initiative is long overdue. We may miss the lunchtime drinking. But if we’re honest, not really.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But thanks to\u0026nbspColston, who started localised growing programmes in 2018, her descendants have survived. Her great-great-great-great granddaughter is sitting at a table made from oak grown from an acorn Colston planted, and harvested at a a sawmill established under Colston’s watch, which has brought business back to the valley. “Thank you for making change happen and thank you for our future,” the descendant writes.\u0026nbspGovernment set to ‘miss public land housebuilding target by 95,000’NHS hospital in England refusing to accept patients from WalesScottish Government plans to tackle land ownership inequalityIt’s Wednesday lunchtime in an empty shopping unit in the Capitol Centre, Cardiff, and Colston is one of of a handful of residents presenting their vision for the future of the Welsh valleys. Nearly 100 people are gathered, including Welsh assembly members, local councillors, forestry authorities and community groups. The Skyline Project has\u0026nbspspent nine months engaging\u0026nbspartists to unlock residents’\u0026nbspideas about their natural environment. The resulting maps and quotations are pasted all over the gallery walls, including dreams of swimming pools, walking routes, honeybees and wild birds.Colston’s postcard might be fantasy today, but Skyline\u0026nbspsees this artistic reimagining as the first step to a community action plan for the land.One man is here to show them what’s possible. Alastair McIntosh was one of four founders of the Isle of Eigg Trust in 1991, which in the space of six years wrested the island in the Scottish Hebrides from rich owners and put it in the hands of the community. “It’s not about sloganising politics, it’s about figuring out things that are going to work,” he says. “You have to start digging with a teaspoon, then a spade, then a digger, and then political confidence to flow into those channels.”But Scotland has a very different tradition of land ownership. As well as positive examples of community ownership, Scotland has a history of crofting, or long term leases of private land to stewards, and momentum is growing for further reform. An investigation by the Scottish Land Commission found that concentrated land ownership in Scotland, where 1,125 people own 70 per cent of the land, has held back prospects for economic, housing and community development. The commission went so far as to describe the concentration of land ownership in Scotland as “socially corrosive”.The situation in Wales is different. Wales has fewer private landowners. It also has much more public land. The question for the groups involved in Skyline is whether they can get public bodies to support their ideas. “Being able to get land is a political thing,” says Mark Walton, the co-director of Shared Assets. “In Scotland it required legislation. What’s exciting is that Skyline is looking at what is already publicly owned land. It is in the gift of authorities to transfer ownership to communities or give them leases to allow the to manage productively. That’s a massive opportunity because it overcomes the main barrier to entry, which is the cost of buying the land.”Walton says that an ambitious programme of land transfer to communities in urban areas has the potential to revitalise areas still reeling from the death of traditional industry, particularly in Wales and the north of England. But he acknowledges that is it sometimes difficult for authorities to cede power: “Authorities are afraid because this fundamentally changes the relationship between the state and the people. It changes the way the civil servants behave. It changes the dynamic – and that is scary.”Ian Thomas, runs Welcome to Our Woods, a community partnership in the upper Rhondda Fawr making local natural resources accessible to residents. In May, Welcome to Our Woods was awarded £90,000 in grants and loans from the Co-op Foundation, to put towards its project converting waste wood into furniture and biomass fuel, generating income. The money has been generated by the sale of 5p bags in the Co-op’s Welsh supermarkets.In October, Thomas, Colston and other volunteers from other valleys groups visited the Kilfinan Community Forest in Tighnabruaich, which manages ownership of 434 hectares of Acharossan Forest. Chris Blake, who started the Skyline Project, says that the trip proved the possibilities. “To see for yourselves what the forest crofts has achieved in eight years was quite staggering,” he says. “At the end of the day we sat down and suddenly we realised it can be done.”Geraint Davies, the Plaid Cymru councillor for Treherbert ward, is among those at the event in the shopping centre. As visitors browse\u0026nbspthe exhibition, he remembers playing in the mountains as a child:\u0026nbsp“We used to be up there making dams, but you don’t see children up there now.”Would he support community ownership of the land? “I think that would be wonderful,” he says. “It’s very important to get people committed to the area through ownership. In the past people have come in, done things, and gone again.”Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport at the Welsh assembly, sees Skyline as part of a broader movement for the democratic ownership of land and the economy that is going on in places like Preston in Lancashire and Barcelona in Spain.How South Wales is learning from community forests in Scotland“There has been a profound change going on in the valleys in just two generations. There’s been considerable depopulation\u0026nbspand some areas are returning to semi-rural, which creates a range of policy challenges but also opens up a new way of doing things,” Waters says. “Might the Welsh government give Skyline funding for land? There’s absolutely no reason why we wouldn’t. We’d have to see some detail but I think it’s got huge potential.”Thomas says the seeds of change have already been planted. “When we looked at our land we found that 85 per cent is public estate,” he says. “So we’re not talking about ownership because as far as we’re concerned we already own the land. It’s about what level of stewardship we get. What we are looking at is a micro-hydro scheme, a sawmill, solar farms and forest crofts.

The Public Prosecution Service announced only one former British soldier is to be put on trial in connection with his role in the shootings that left 13 people dead in Derry on 30 January 1972. Families of those killed gathered outside The Museum of Free Derry, yards from where the killings took place, before marching to the city centre hotel to hear the announcementThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince.

A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It’s preposterous, but he mixes just enough heart into a buckwild character performance that it’s never too over-the-top. His version of Pikachu is more than just a sidekick who follows Tim around. He’s the driving force behind the movie, but he doesn’t ever try to put on a ludicrously serious tone, even during the movie’s more combre moments – he understands that he’s playing a CGI yellow mouse capable of shooting electricity out of his rosy cheeks.Neither Pikachu nor any of the other Pokémon look as though they belong in the live-action environments. Rather, they seem to have been superimposed – a miscalculation of several factors, from lighting inconsistencies to unconvincing CG textures to the lack of care put into their virtual performances.There’s a lot of fun to have with Detective Pikachu if you’re in the right mindset. Ryan Reynolds brings charm, quick wit, and kinetic energy to the title character. The special effects teams, of which they are legion, maximised cuteness for Pikachu he’s literally never not cute in any frame of this movie, and that will get some people through by itself.\u0026nbspMuch like its title character – an adorable little fuzzy yellow whatsit bearing the smart-aleck voice of Ryan Reynolds – Pokémon: Detective Pikachu is an odd creation powered by contradictory impulses. An aggressively cute family film that’s also a spectacle-driven sci-fi noir-mystery with hints of Blade Runner and the third act of every Marvel movie, this adaptation of the popular 2016 video game throws everything at the audience with such vehemence that the sum effect is overwhelming more than it is entertaining.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual.

I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” Having originally\u0026nbsppreviewed at Soho Theatre before its Edinburgh Festival debut in 2013, Fleabag – written by Waller-Bridge and directed by\u0026nbspVicky Jones – quickly won rave critical reviews.The show was later adapted into a television show, the second series of which premiered on BBC Three earlier this year.The first series, which centres on the eponymous character as she comes to terms with both a friend’s and her mother’s deaths,\u0026nbspearned Waller-Bridge a BAFTA Award for Best Female Comedy Performance.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eighteen years on, the New Yorker recalls the horror of\u0026nbsp911 and its aftermath, and how it has informed his writing…Click to followThe IndependentSmoke pours from the twin towers of the World Trade Centre after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attackOn 10 September 2001, I went to bed with a stuffy head, and took a decongestant. So on the 11th I awoke late, groggy. My wife had already left for work. Our dog kept me company while I shaved and showered, dressed and caffeinated. I was aiming to leave for the office by a quarter to nine.I was one minute late.So it was 8.46am when I bent to say goodbye to Charlie Brown, and off to the side some fast movement caught my eye, with a whirr-whoosh that sounded like a cartoon version of an incoming missile, some disaster about to befall Wile E\u0026nbspCoyote. I spun my head to the window where the noise had shot by, but I saw nothing. I stood up. I turned to the south. That’s when I saw.This was not a great apartment. But one corner of the loft was lined with huge windows that faced the Hudson River to the west, and the World Trade Centre\u0026nbspjust a couple of blocks to the south. The view was breathtaking, the immensity of the towers filling your field of vision. Sometimes I’d just sit and stare at the towers, awestruck.Now, at 8.47 on a Tuesday morning, I was staring at a hole in one of the buildings.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.I immediately called my wife, told her, “I think the World Trade Centre just got hit by a missile.” I turned on the television, which was at first reporting nothing definitive, but the situation was definitely alarming. I was still staring out the window, listening to nothing on the TV, when the second plane hit. The fireball briefly looked like it was never going to stop expanding, it would engulf me. I flinched away, nearly toppled over my chair.Now we knew that New York was being attacked. But was that attack finished? Or were these planes just the first two salvos of a massive bombardment, an invasion of the country, the end of the world as we know it?On 911, people remember their favourite story about Steve BuscemiI definitely didn’t want to go outside. Our home was surrounded by high-value targets – City Hall, Wall Street, both the New York and the American Stock Exchanges, the Federal Building, every level of government and finance, the main switching station for transatlantic and East Coast telephone calls, big bridges and long tunnels, all this crucial infrastructure was right out the door. Back in college in the 1980s, I’d taken a poli-sci class called War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, and one of our assignments was to determine the single spot in the entire world that could do the most damage – human fatalities, economic disruption, political upheaval – with a modest-sized nuclear device. Everyone in the class came up with the same answer: that spot was right here. It was demonstrable it was math.What was I going to do? I definitely wasn’t going to the office. But should I be behaving as if the city was\u0026nbspbeing invaded? What would that behaviour look like?I started to notice pieces of building falling off a tower, one bit after another, from the very top. This didn’t make sense, I didn’t see any damage up there. So I looked more carefully. Those were not bits of building. Those were people. They were jumping off the roof, a thousand feet in the sky.When the south tower began to collapse, for the briefest second it wasn’t obvious to me what was happening, then I understood, but it still wasn’t thoroughly clear how exactly the building was going to fall, or how much of it, or in what direction, and if that tower fell over like a lumberjacked tree, and tipped my way, it would land on me.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a partyThe immense cloud of dust and debris came hurtling towards me, a terrifying mass containing... what? Girders, I-beams, mammoth chunks of concrete, who the hell knew, maybe the entire collapsing building was in that cloud – was that cloud – headed my way at a hundred miles an hour, two hundred, who could tell? So I picked up Charlie Brown and fled from whatever was going to come crashing through the window, through the walls, through the roof. I shut us in the dark of the windowless bathroom.I thought: I might be about to die. Right now.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a party. Was this the last noise I’d ever hear? I waited, my hands shaking as I stroked the dog, my heart racing...After a few seconds of nothing, I opened the door.I hadn’t turned on any lights that morning, because it was a spectacularly beautiful day, as usual for that time of year I have since come to think of it as 11 September weather. But now the rooms were almost completely dark in the blackout of that cloud. I couldn’t see anything out the windows, just thick dark greyness pushing up against the glass, like Stephen King’s fog. I turned on lights. The sound of shattering glass? That was a picture that had been shaken off the wall.I couldn’t even see the building across the street, 40ft away. But the cloud slowly dispersed until finally I could dimly make out the World Trade Centre site, where there was now only one Twin Tower. Was there really nothing left?The cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body partsJust a few minutes later, the other building came down.\u0026nbsp How did I not see that coming?I eventually went downstairs, outside, to reconnaissance. It was slow-motion chaos out there, shell-shocked people staggering through the mess, papers fluttering in the sky, everything under a thick coat of ash, like fresh snow. The only thing that seemed to be happening quickly were the sirens, they were wailing from every direction, fast-moving vehicles somewhere I couldn’t see. I found a policeman, who told me I should prepare to leave, the electricity was going to be turned off, the gas, the water too, all for safety. My building was going to be evacuated. The whole neighbourhood.So in the middle of the afternoon, I left home carrying a single change of clothing, and basic toiletries, and a couple of meals for Charlie Brown. My dog and I trudged through the ash across City Hall Park, up and over the Brooklyn Bridge, from which I couldn’t stop turning back to look over my shoulders, where there were no Twin Towers left at all.It didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t step back into our home for two weeks, and even then it was only a brief visit on a grim Sunday, accompanied by a police escort who was there to make sure we didn’t stay, or stick around too long. Also the cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body parts.My wife and dog and I were living with relatives uptown, in a spare bedroom. Indefinitely.We were finally allowed to move home in mid-October. Our neighbourhood had become the Frozen Zone, ning a few blocks in every direction from Ground Zero, penned in by thousands of feet of newly erected chain link patrolled by National Guardsmen in battle fatigues and helmets carrying assault rifles, militarised checkpoints, we had to present ID to prove our residency, our identity. The local school had been repurposed as a staging area for a rescue effort that never rescued a single person then for the recovery, the cleanup.The thing that’s impossible to understand if you weren’t there was the smell. Those massive piles of rubble – what was left of two tremendous buildings, each more than a quarter-mile tall – those piles were on fire for one hundred days, acrid clouds of smoke that weren’t fully extinguished until mid-December. The stench was sickening. The sounds of the earth-movers constant. The stadium lights glared all through the night, every night. The armoured vehicles and uniformed men, weapons everywhere: a warzone.But by 13 September\u0026nbspI’d returned to work. I was 33 years old, married but childless, a moment in life when nothing seems as important as career. So of course I went back to work. But my publishing house’s office building was threatened with bomb scares every few days, we needed to evacuate and wander around Midtown, anxiously awaiting the all-clear. Eventually we stopped believing, we stopped leaving, even while anthrax attacks were invading other media offices in the neighbourhood, killing other people who walked these very same streets, people who could have been me. Everyone jumped every time a truck rumbled by. I never slept through the night, and repeatedly injured myself in the kitchen, knife cuts, burns. At the time, I didn’t recognise\u0026nbspPTSD. I just knew my hands and arms were covered in wounds.This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishesWhat was coming next? We were all convinced it was something.In New York, especially down in the Frozen Zone, 11 September\u0026nbsplasted a very long time. The terror seemed permanent. It wasn’t.Fifteen years later, I rarely thought about terrorism anymore it became something that happened somewhere else. But then I went to one of those somewhere elses: Paris, still reeling from its own series of brutal terror attacks, a city with soldiers everywhere, bomb-sniffing dogs, everything suffused with tension, fear. This felt so familiar, this felt exactly like New York after 911, this new category of historical moment: a global metropolis sieged by terror.Not only did this remind me of 2001, it also reminded me of something that had become a constant part of my recent life: suspense novels, which I’d started writing in 2009. The beautiful foreign setting. The definite sense that something bad was going to happen, but the fundamental uncertainty about what exactly that bad thing would be, to whom, and why, and when. Is it now? What should I do? Should I be acting as if this is a life-and-death situation?Trump’s bizarre quotes about 911 before becoming presidentSeptember 11 memorial’s architect looks back, and ahead911 anniversary: Handwritten notes reveal how George W Bush reacted This all defined my experience of 911 and its aftermath, the uncertainty and confusion and mistaken assumptions – was that a missile, is the fireball going to engulf me, will the building fall on me, are there really bombs in the office, or anthrax, was that sound an explosion or a car backfiring, why the hell am I bleeding all the time?This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishes.This is also what a certain type of suspense novel can do.Ever since 911, it had dwelt in the back of my mind that I’d someday write a novel that revolved around a terrorist event. But I didn’t want to write the expected novel, with the expected villains, the expected heroes I don’t want to write the expected anything.\u0026nbspThat someday was right now. The something that was happening next in Paris wasn’t an explosion, it was something much more mundane: I was going to write that terrorism novel, right now. I took my laptop to a café on the rue de Grenelle, opened a new file, and started work immediately, a story that begins on an autumn Tuesday morning at a quarter to nine, when normal ends.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite initial public disapproval and the threat of criminal charges and imprisonment, her\u0026nbspidea\u0026nbspstuck.\u0026nbspMartin Purdy\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentMs Leyel’s ballots helped set up Westfield War Memorial Village in Lancaster in the 1920s – it was a home for veteransIn December 1921, the public gallery of Marylebone Magistrates’ Court in London was filled with “fashionably dressed ladies’’ keen to hear the latest charges to be levied against a popular socialite called Hilda Leyel. In taking on such a well-connected member of British society, the prosecutors were playing with high stakes – and it was a roll of the dice that would ultimately result in the rules of charitable fundraising being changed for ever across the United Kingdom.The breaches of the Betting Act that\u0026nbspLeyel found herself charged with were all linked to a national lottery – one that by 1920 had already raised more than £250,000 to specifically help some of the 1.7 million disabled servicemen who had returned to home shores from the killing fields of the First World War.Billed as “golden ballots”, the lotteries were the first of their kind and the forerunners of the same National Lottery that continues to persuade so many of us to part with a smattering of our cash each week.\u0026nbspUnlike the modern lottery, all of the profits from Hilda Leyel’s ballots went to hospitals that specialised in the rehabilitation of the wounded of war, including prosthetic limbs, work retraining schemes and bespoke housing projects.\u0026nbspVery like the modern lottery, the winners could win life-changing prizes, from £25,000 in cash to strings of pearls – or a cow and an acre of land on which to graze it!\u0026nbspAt one of Leyel’s inaugural court hearings in April 1920, the newspaper reports of the day took great delight in pointing out that Lady Asquith, the wife of the prime minister that had taken Britain to war, had been among those present to support the accused. Furthermore, Lady Asquith was said to have shocked those present by laughing out loud when the prosecutor said that among the prizes had been the chance to dine at the Savoy Hotel in London for a week – “allowing the common chimney sweep the chance to experience the life of a Lord’’.How a British officer was worshipped as a god in 19th century IndiaWhile the society ladies of London may well have been amused by such a concept, the crown was not. Nevertheless, it did accept that the golden ballots were not the work of criminal masterminds and that none involved had personally gained from the enterprise.\u0026nbspThis was important as there were certainly some big reputations at stake. Among Leyel’s main supporters were Major-General Sir Geoffrey Feilding, who had served with distinction in the Boer War and successfully commanded an elite Coldstream Guards’ Division in the recent world war, as well as the Earl of Denbigh and Sir William Tyrrell, an assistant under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office.Ever-mindful of who they were dealing with, the prosecution remained at pains throughout to stress that it did not seek to question the honourable aims of those involved but simply wished to stop a precedent being set that would open the door to more ‘’unscrupulous’’ iniduals – people who might use such lotteries to ‘‘feather their own nests’’.In presenting Leyel with eight specimen charges, carrying a fine of £25 or three-months imprisonment each, they undoubtedly hoped that the socialite would opt to pay up and consign the enterprise to anecdote. They had, however, underestimated her fighting spirit.Created with Sketch.The best of The Independent\u0027s photography Show all 48Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protests

1880, the daughter of a schoolmaster from the Uppingham School in Rutland. As a child she had been a keen collector of herbs and flowers and nurtured an ambition to study medicine. However, a secondary passion for acting ultimately changed that – for it was while\u0026nbspacting with the Benson Troupe that she met a young Swedish nobleman called Carl Leyel, and before the century was out the teenager and her beau had married.The Leyels went on to have two sons, both of whom were thankfully still too young to serve when war broke out in the summer of 1914. However, Hilda’s role as an actress would bring her in to contact with many of the wounded of the conflict that was slowly tearing the world apart.In the pre-war years Hilda had been an honorary treasurer of the Actresses Franchise League (AFL) established to promote female enfranchisement and suffrage via acting, education and leafleting. During the war the AFL, which neither openly supported nor condemned militancy, put its work on hold and formed Women’s Theatre Camps Entertainments. The group performed at army camps and hospitals and it is presumed that it was as a result of this work that Hilda became introduced, and then fully committed, to the care of wounded servicemen. After the war had ended she came up with the concept of the golden ballots to ensure that such men could continue to receive the aftercare and support they so desperately needed.\u0026nbspLeyel in the 1920sThe sad reality is that successive post-war governments proved themselves far from willing to take adequate responsibility for the disabled of the recent war. While pensions had improved during the conflict, and a more centralised form of care had been established by the creation of a Ministry of Pensions, few historians would argue that the state did anything other than attempt to minimise its financial support. In many ways it was able to get away with this courtesy of the sympathy of the public for the large numbers of disabled men who were providing a highly evocative and visceral presence on the streets of so many communities. In fact, by the time of the Armistice on 11 November\u0026nbsp 1918, there were already 6,000 charities registered to support injured ex-servicemen.Nevertheless, as Britain rapidly found itself slipping into a post-war depression, and money became desperately tight for many households, it proved an ever-greater challenge for the charity sector to find ways to get the public to put its hand in its pocket. The old adage that charity begins at home\u0026nbsphad never been more prescient for families living on the breadline as unemployment levels hit record highs.\u0026nbspIn addition to the difficult economic situation, the sheer number of charities operating in Britain – which had doubled to around 36,000 as a direct result of the war – meant that fundraisers were being forced to become far more professional and innovative in order to stand out from the crowd and attract donations. Many of the charitable practices that we now accept as commonplace, from the concept of professional marketing campaigns to the introduction of bespoke charity shops, can be traced back to this period.The golden ballots were, however, a genuine masterstroke. The public could take part in these ballots knowing that their money was going to support a noble cause, while\u0026nbspalso offering them the chance to become personally enriched. It’s an approach that modern descendants of the ballots, including our own National Lottery, have continued to attempt to emulate with the majority of the public’s weekly stake going to support good causes, as well as arts and heritage projects, while a handful of lucky members of the public can win life-changing amounts.Such was the fame of Hilda Leyel’s ballots, footage of the chic looking socialite can still be found in the British Pathe film archive showing her arriving on the doorstep of unsuspecting members of the public to announce their windfalls. These films were aired in cinemas across Britain, describing\u0026nbspHilda as a “fairy godmother”, and highlighting the potential backlash the crown faced in prosecuting her.Indeed, the popularity of Hilda Leyel with the public may well have been key to her decision to plead ‘’not guilty’’ to the charges levied against her and instead opt for trial by jury. It was a gamble that ultimately paid off, and her subsequent victory in the High Court in 1922 ensured that ballots held solely to raise funds for charitable causes were, from this point forward, legal. The “golden\u0026nbsplady” had changed the face of charitable fundraising in Britain for ever, making her legacy among the most socially important of the First World War.Haig. Hilda was among the honoured guests seated on the village bowling greenDespite this, the coverage in the newspapers of the flagship trial and victory was mooted. It appears that the British media, perhaps reflecting the growing public mood at the time, was keen to draw a line under ‘’the war’’\u0026nbspand focus on the brave new world\u0026nbspinstead.Likewise, when the heroine of the golden ballots died in April 1957 there was even less fanfare. In fact, she had by that time become much better known as the founder of the Society of Herbalists, the proprietor of a chain of related stores called the Culpeper Shops, and as the author of numerous popular tomes on herbalism, including the highly influential The Perfect Picnic\u0026nbspand The Gentle Art of Cookery. Never one to shy away from a battle, she would go on to find herself at the forefront of the fight to ban synthetic fertilisers.How Brexit could end 20 years of peace in Northern IrelandPages from history: The secret suffering of Ceausescu’s babies‘Now I have this thing called life’: How I beat my eating disorderTo find any formal recognition of the First World War fundraising schemes of Hilda Leyel you have to visit Lancaster, the former county town of Lancashire and the home of a rather unique settlement for disabled ex-servicemen called the Westfield War Memorial Village. This community marks its centenary in July of this year, and among the 113 homes nestled behind its grand entrance gates are a collection of four conjoined properties bearing the name of “Leyel Terrace”.The naming of the properties was how the trustees of the Westfield charity thanked Hilda for hosting a second golden ballot on their behalf in the early 1920s. Without the huge amount of money raised – which at £20,000 was in the region of a million pounds at the time – the settlement could not have grown. The money would pay for dozens of new houses, essential utilities such as sewers and pavements and a nest egg to accrue interest that would help support the community in the fallow years to follow.Such was the scale of the financial input, the lead philanthropist behind the Westfield project, Herbert Lushington Storey, would state in a formal public address in 1926: “If I may be so bold as to say so ... I am afraid if it hadn’t been for the assistance of my friend Mrs Leyel we should not have got very far with the scheme.”Mandy Stretch, the present secretary of the charity that continues to run the community, is in no doubt about the vital contribution of Hilda Leyel. She says: “As a result of the huge amount of money Hilda raised, hundreds of ex-service personnel and their families around Britain were to benefit at the end of the First World War. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many continue to benefit today. We have residents living here who have fought in nearly every conflict since the First World War – from the D-Day landings in the 1940s through to recent wars in Afghanistan – who are living in properties that were paid for by Hilda Leyel’s second Golden Ballot.”The Westfield charity will this month unveil a new memorial in recognition of the vital role that philanthropy and charity have played throughout history in the care of Britain’s disabled of war. Needless to say, at the unveiling of the memorial, special mention will be given to Hilda Leyel, the mother of two, actress, suffragist and fundraiser who risked her reputation and liberty to leave a vital and lasting mark on the whole process.Dr Martin Purdy is the historian in residence at the Westfield War Memorial Village Lancaster and the co-author of such popular First World War books as ‘Doing Our Bit’ and ‘The Gallipoli Oak’. Though old enough to know better, he fronts the internationally acclaimed folk trio Harp and a Monkey.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Four decades on from that day, believes Sean O’Grady, we may be on the cusp of a similar shift – this time to the leftClick to followThe IndependentThis lady wasn’t for turning: Margaret Thatcher back in September 1987. She came to power on 3 May 1979The story goes that Margaret Thatcher, long after she had left office, was asked what her greatest achievement had been. “Tony Blair and New Labour,” was the immediate, bright-eyed reply. By that she meant even the Labour Party had accepted the economic reconstruction of the country that began exactly four decades ago, when she won the general election of 1979. Socialism, in the sense she had fought against as a force in British politics was, if not extirpated, then certainly dormant.If the anecdote is correct, then her abiding legacy – that long-lasting Thatcherite settlement, largely accepted by Blair – lies in some jeopardy today. Jeremy Corbyn closes in on No 10 Theresa May’s pragmatic government provides a model in how not to “do politics” and there is something of a leftward shift in public opinion. Is there a sense of change in the air again?The 1979 election is counted by historians as one of the most significant of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury. The election of 1906 brought to power a Liberal government that laid the foundations for the welfare state the Labour government of 1945 made the welfare state complete with the NHS, nationalised of the “commanding heights” of the economy, and embarked on the dissolution of the British Empire and the Thatcher government elected in 1979 set about reversing much of that established but failing social democratic post-war consensus.Even at the time, the 1979 contest was granted an historic status, at least by some. For the Labour prime minister that Thatcher vanquished, James Callaghan, defeat came as no surprise.\u0026nbspHe intimated as much to one of his closest advisers, Bernard, now Lord, Donoghue near polling day, 3 May. When a rogue poll was published offering him a flicker of hope that his beleaguered government might yet win another term, Callaghan demurred: “I should not be too sure. You know, there are times, perhaps every 30 years, when there is a sea change in politics. It then does not matter what you say or what you do. There is a shift in what the public wants and what it approves of. I suspect there is now such a sea change – and it is for Thatcher.”Created with Sketch.Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1979 Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher holds her namesake, Maggie a Charolais calf, during campaigning of East AngliaMargaret Thatcher visiting a factory during her election campaignLeader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher, addressing the Tories at the start of the 1979 general election campaignConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher helping out local butcher Mr Miller during canvassingMargaret Thatcher making a telephone call in the Conservative Party coach during her election campaignConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher using a broom to sweep the grass on a visit to a hardware firm during canvassingThatcher packing Creme Eggs on a visit to the Cadbury factory in Birmingham during her election tour of BritainConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher posing with the politicians who will make up her cabinet if they won their seats in the General Election (L-R) Angus Maude, James Prior, Humphrey Atkins, Lord Thorneycroft, Sir Keith Joseph, Lord Carrington, Francis Pym, Sir Ian Gilmour and Sir Geoffrey Howe, at her home in ChelseaMargaret Thatcher with her daughter Carol and husband Denis (behind) smiling outside their home as Carol is welcomed back from Australia to help with her mothers election campaign in Chelsea, London, April 23rd 1979.

From left Nigel Davenport, Molly Weir, Liz Fraser, Pete Murray, Vince Hill and LuluConservative MP and new Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, arriving at No.10 Downing Street after winning the General Election and defeating the Labour Party under James CallaghanIn 2019 we are, theoretically, due another “watershed” election (or referendum) –\u0026nbspperhaps undoing the historic commitment to Europe and what Maggie put in place.I remember the day Thatcher arrived in Downing Street very well, watching those famous scenes of her on the steps of Downing Street on the BBC Nine O’Clock News – no rolling news channels in those days (and we’d only just got a colour TV set). Her words – a prayer by St Francis of Assisi –\u0026nbspstruck me then, and still today, as such a strange choice, promising the kind of national reconciliation that such a combative politician was unlikely to want to deliver: “Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.”It was much assumed at the time, especially in the Labour Party (of which I was then a precocious member), that this apparition of Victorian values would soon be kicked out of office. Thatcher’s insane economic experiments with monetarism, mass unemployment and defeating the unions would fail spectacularly, it was confidently predicted.After all, in 1970 her immediate Conservative predecessor, Edward Heath, had also been elected on a programme of radical market-driven change, resolving to tame the trades unions. After little more than three years of battling unsuccessfully he was thrown out of office in an election called, ironically enough, on the slogan “Who governs Britain?” –\u0026nbspmeaning him or the coal miners’ union, the NUM. “Not you, mate,” was the electorate’s reply.Having suffered power cuts, a state of emergency, a three-day working week and what he himself described as “a harder Christmas than we have known since the war”, Heath’s defeat seemed to prove that the UK would not be ruled without the consent of the trades unions.Why wouldn’t\u0026nbspThatcher also come a cropper?\u0026nbsp No reason, except that, in the intervening years the unions had abused their position even more. This time they had broken a Labour administration headed by a man, Callaghan, who was once a trade union official himself (for the white-collar Inland Revenue Staff Federation), and prided himself on close links with the union “barons”. Thus the myth that the UK could be governed only with the agreement of the unions – which meant the Labour Party –\u0026nbspwas broken instead the choice was whether the nation wished to be governed by the unions or not.It is difficult at this distance to appreciate the scale of union power in the Britain of the 1970s. They could make or break governments of any party, and they did. They defied parliament.\u0026nbspThe Winter of Discontent in 1978-79 offered plenty of material for\u0026nbspThatcher, for the anti-union press (then more powerful and just as vicious) and for the average British citizen to believe something had gone badly wrong with the way the country was run.Corbyn aims to put unions back on top – we should be terrifiedIt is a lost world. The strikers – many pathetically poorly paid – refused to work because the government tried to run a “pay policy”, attempting to limit the rise in wages across every worker in the economy to, at that time, 5 per cent in a year.\u0026nbspThatcher, of course, promised an end to the farce.When Callaghan returned to freezing Britain, tanned from an international summit in Guadeloupe, he proffered the opinion that most people around the world would not share the view that there was mounting chaos. The out-of-touch complacency was, if inaccurately, devastatingly reflected in a telling Sun headline: “Crisis? What Crisis?”Everyone seemed to be on strike – municipal workers such as school caretakers, “bin men” and “dinner ladies” (I use the antique terms deliberately), NHS ancillary workers, ambulance drivers, lorry drivers, petrol tanker drivers, print workers, car workers, bakers. The scenes of black bags of rubbish strewn around streets would haunt Labour for years. Schools and petrol stations closed, hospitals allowed emergencies only, meals on wheels stopped.Daily Mail could justifiably run the headline: “Now they won’t let us bury our dead!”There was plenty to be disillusioned by and only one politician provided much hope, real or imagined, about the future.The cabinet pondered how to get “blackleg” strike-breaking grave diggers past the cemetery gates and through the mass picketing – a riot at a funeral would have been all the papers needed to hang the ultimate shame around the neck of Callaghan and his hapless ministers.By 1979, then, the unions were resented for their abuse of power. Combined with the activities\u0026nbspof the IRA\u0026nbsp(who assassinated Airey Neave MP, one of Thatcher’s closest friends, and Lord Mountbatten that year), as well as occasional violence from the political extremes, many commentators were asking whether Britain was governable. Books came out with titles such as Britain in Agony.Routinely the UK was ranked as the “sick man of Europe”, a visibly decaying, grey, grim land of strikes and failing public services. Things simply didn’t work. You’d wait six months to have a landline installed by the nationalised Post Office Telephones. The railways under British Rail were a loss-making mess, infamous for inedible sandwiches and filthy, elderly rolling stock. The British Steel Corporation, the National Coal Board, National Express, the National Bus Company, British Shipbuilders, British Leyland, the Royal Mail, British Airways and various other nationalised industries, owned and subsidised by the taxpayer, sometimes lost millions a week.Saatchi and Saatchi’s classic 1978 posterThe only growth industries in the country were North Sea oil – there by accident – and punk rock. Then, as now, there was some sentiment that immigration was too high, with the far right taking advantage (though\u0026nbspThatcher succeeded in attracting and neutralising much of the National Front’s appeal when she made a – probably –\u0026nbspcalculated “gaffe” about people feeling “swamped” in some communities). Every year the stagnant British economy fell further behind living standards in France and Germany. Sterling was almost continually on the slide.We had Morecambe and Wise, but Britain was not a happy place.\u0026nbspThe social democratic paradise that Labour and Conservative governments had tried to build since 1945, based on consensus around the welfare state, progressive taxation, a commitment to full employment and Keynesian demand management of the economy, had collapsed.The nation was bust. In 1976 we had to ask the IMF for a loan, mortgaged on North Sea oil, because no one in the real world – the Americans, the Germans, the Japanese, the pension funds – was willing to lend money to HM Government. It was humiliating. Comprehensive education, high rise council blocks, local government reform, decimalisation, Concorde (an expensive commercial flop), the Jeremy Thorpe affair, the social security system – all were lesser but potent sources of disappointment for voters. There was plenty to be disillusioned by and only one politician provided much hope, real or imagined, about the future.That was why\u0026nbspThatcher won the election – it was the end of an era, and the voters realised it. In a phrase she was later to make her own, the feeling in 1979 was that “there is no alternative”. Thatcher enjoyed the best advice in public relations the Saatchi and Saatchi “Labour Isn’t Working” poster of 1978 remains classic.She even had the first “battle bus” fitted with a private radio-telephone. (It stopped working when the bus went under a low bridge and the aerial was knocked off.) More than all that, though, she won the argument, based on the evidence surrounding every voter that past policies had failed and would fail again.Her manifesto was a model in travelling light – few specifics, plenty of aspiration. To restore the health of our economic and social life. To restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy. To uphold parliament and the rule of law.Yet in opposition from 1975 to 1979, Thatcher, whose only top job had been education secretary, was regarded as strident, extreme and unproven, always lagging behind prime minister Callaghan in the personal ratings. Callaghan succeeded (in those sexist days) in patronising her as “the little lady” who would one day learn the ways of the world.The Thatcher revolution, in other words, was far from pre-ordained. What made the difference was that sea change in the public mood. Before that, in the autumn of 1978, there was talk of Sunny Jim cashing in on relatively subdued inflation and a pickup in economic growth and prosperity. He chose not to, gambling on a better 1979, and failed in the most spectacular manner possible.Are we ready for another sea change in 2019? It is entertaining to speculate what\u0026nbspThatcher would have made of Jeremy Corbyn (and they did overlap as MPs from his arrival in the Commons in 1983 to her departure in 1992). She might well have rather liked him, as she had a soft spot for those she recognised as fellow “conviction” politicians, even if they were of the left.Figures such as Michael Foot, Tony Benn and, especially, Eric Heffer earned her respect and even affection she openly despised Neil Kinnock, who moved from a sports-jacketed soft lefty unilateralist into a dark blue-suited centrist almost as soon as he had won leadership on the back of his supposed socialist credentials. Corbyn she would no doubt have thought was a man who followed the dictum of her beloved father, Alderman Roberts of Grantham, who taught her never to change her opinions just because it was fashionable to do so.Pym, Sir Ian Gilmour and (far right) Sir Geoffrey Howe\u0026nbsp(Getty)\u0026nbspIn a way you can, apart from the last bit, almost imagine Corbyn making parts of the speech Thatcher made in the 1979 campaign on a visit to Swansea: “I am a conviction politician. The Old Testament prophets didn’t merely say, ‘Brothers, I want consensus.’ They said, ‘This is my faith and vision. This is what I passionately believe. If you believe it too, then come with me.’ Tonight I say to you just that.”Corbyn is hardly the smart, skilful, often shrewd and careful politician Thatcher usually was, but he has more in common with the Iron Lady than the vacillating, managerial civil servant manque Theresa May, who might be thought a more obvious parallel. Indeed May, presiding over a minority government habitually suffering defeats and relying on a pact with a smaller party, resembles Callaghan quite closely. The next sea change may be for Corbyn, conviction politician, if it has not already hit us through Brexit.A further personal note, if I may. In 1979, as I watched Thatcher winning what was to be the first of three successive general elections, I felt two things. First, this woman means business.The Huawei row reminds me of one of Thatcher’s infamous bust upsMay and Corbyn face Brexit backlash after election lossesCorbyn ally says Labour trying to ‘bail out’ Tories over BrexitSecond, I surmised, she will probably be around for longer than the Labour Party seem to think. So it proved. I was 17 when she came to power and 35 when Blair finally evicted John Major’s fag-end Conservatives from government – a fact that never fails to stun.Looking back from the 21st\u0026nbspcentury, which in 1979 was still a matter of science fiction, we can see just how necessary most of her reforms were to make the economy work again, raise productivity, make new technology and new enterprise a possibility, and attract inward investment to a land where management could manage their businesses without being taxed to pay for lame ducks. Even so, unless you had money, the Thatcher years certainly weren’t much fun at the time, and some of us could see that pain coming.I look towards the Corbyn sea change, if that’s what it is, with no less trepidation than I did the Thatcher revolution, and with considerably less hope that the sacrifices to\u0026nbspbe made will be worth it.I certainly pray we will not have to relearn the lessons so harshly learned in the 1970s, then relive the remedies of the 1980s. We really don’t want to go through all that again.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Meanwhile, at Cala in San Francisco, Cámara hires staff from different backgrounds and cultures, including ex-felons and ex-addicts, who view the work as an important opportunity to grow as iniduals. A Tale of Two Kitchens explores the ways in which a restaurant can serve as a place of both dignity and community.A short following families in Puerto Rico who are currently living in FEMA hotels around New York City. Their stories will unfold observationally over the course of the next month as they face the extreme situation of getting kicked out of the hotel or are forced to go back to Puerto Rico.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Families of those killed gathered outside The Museum of Free Derry, yards from where the killings took place, before marching to the city centre hotel to hear the announcementThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it has revealed next to nothing about what exactly went wrong.Now\u0026nbspHans\u0026nbspKoenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for SpaceX, admitted that there had been an anomaly. But the company continued to be tight-lipped about the details of the problem.The April 20 accident occurred on a landing zone at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as SpaceX was conducting a test of emergency thrusters designed to propel the capsule, dubbed Crew Dragon, to safety from atop the rocket in the event of a launch failure.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

There were no injuries. SpaceX had taken all safety measures prior to this test, as we always do.The news conference was called ahead of Friday\u0027s scheduled launch of an unmanned resupply mission to the international space station using a cargo-only capsule built by SpaceX, the private rocket venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.When pressed, Koenigsmann declined to characterise the nature of the accident, including whether an explosion or fire was involved. NASA has likewise demurred when asked to describe the mishap.A leaked video of the accident, which was acknowledged as authentic by a NASA contractor in an internal memo obtained by the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, showed the astronaut capsule blasting into smithereens. A pall of smoke was also widely observed rising over the launch pad from a distance at the time of the ill-fated test.The Crew Dragon had been scheduled to carry US\u0026nbspastronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a test mission in July, although the recent accident, as well as some other hitches in the vehicle\u0027s design, are likely to push that schedule to later in the year or into 2020.It\u0027s certainly not great news for the schedule overall, but I hope we can recover, Koenigsmann said.The destroyed vehicle was one of six such capsules built or in late production by SpaceX, and the first flown into space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched it without crew to the space station in March for a six-day visit before returning to Earth, splashing down safely in the Atlantic for retrieval.We have no reason to believe there is an issue with the SuperDracos themselves, Koenigsmann said, adding that the engines have been tested nearly 600 times in the past.NASA has been awarded $6.8bn to SpaceX and rival Boeing Co to develop separate capsule systems to fly astronauts to space, but both companies have faced technical challenges and delays.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The\u0026nbspexhibition is shown at\u0026nbspTurner Contemporary in Margate, with the organisers saying the choice of sponsor was down to the venue.Turner Contemporary and Tate have since ended their relationship with Stagecoach in a\u0026nbspmutual agreement.A statement from them reads: Turner Contemporary and Tate’s highest priority is to show and celebrate artists and their work.The Turner Prize celebrates the creative freedoms of the visual arts community and our wider society. By mutual agreement, we will not proceed with Stagecoach South East’s sponsorship of this year’s prize.The transport firm also released\u0026nbspa statement, reading: Stagecoach South East has mutually agreed with Turner Contemporary and Tate not to continue with the company\u0027s sponsorship of the 2019 Turner Prize.We are absolutely committed to ersity in our company however, we do not want anything to distract from celebrating the Turner Prize artists and their work.Turner Prize chooses anti-gay rights campaigner as sponsorThe Turner Prize’s 10 most memorable and outrageous winnersWhen, at the press conference to unveil the shortlist, it was asked if anyone had considered the choice of sponsorship a bad idea, there was an awkward silence.Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said that picking a sponsor is very much a matter for the hosting venue.This year’s shortlist includes Lawrence Abu Hamdan, who conducted interviews with former detainees of a notorious Syrian jail.The other three nominees include London-based filmmaker Helen Cammock, Colombian-born sculptor Oscar Murillo, and self-taught artist Tai Shani, who explores “feminine subjectivity and experience through a gothicscience-fiction lens”.The four shortlisted artists’ work will be displayed from 28 September 2019 to 12 January 2020 at Turner Contemporary in Margate.

And that really hurts. So it was really emotional knowing I’ve got to walk away.”Mr Kelly, who lives in Bermagui, New South Wales, launched a campaign to reclaim the shield in 2016 after he saw it had been loaned\u0026nbspto Canberra’s National Museum of Australia.\u0026nbspHe said he grew up listening to stories about his ancestors from the period of Britiain’s arrival in Australia, and traced his family tree to discover he is a direct descendent of the warrior who was killed. \u0026nbspThe dream now, he said, was to get it back home in time for the 250th anniversary of it being taken.He added the shield represents the\u0026nbspBritish colonisation of Australia, and how they “never respected us as human beings when they opened fire and took everything”.He said people at home were keen to learn about their roots and the shield was a major symbol of the past that could help teach them.\u0026nbspHow an Aboriginal approach to mental health is helping farmersAboriginal teen makes history for reaching Miss World Australia Finals“They’re all just asking me ‘When are they coming back? Can you bring them back yet?’”But he said the British Museum Act is one of the reasons why the institute is refusing to return the shield.\u0026nbspA report by Sarah Keenan,\u0026nbspsenior professor at Birkbeck Law School, claims the British Museum “changed its story” about the origins of the Gweagal Shield when a two-day workshop to “test the argument the shield was collected at Botany bay in 1770” led\u0026nbspparticipants to argue\u0026nbspit is not from Cook’s landing.\u0026nbspMr Kelly said repatriation was important in light of “all the stuff that’s happened in the past” and it would be a “huge moment in time to have the British Museum and others actually return things to the Aboriginal people because it would be a great step towards the healing process.”He added ancestral spears taken by Cook and his men at the same time\u0026nbspwere held at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge\u0026nbsphe also viewed those privately last year.Mr Kelly’s claim to the artefacts has been backed by a motion passed in 2016 by New South Wales’ parliament, which acknowledged his clan as the shield’s rightful owners\u0026nbspAustralia’s Senate followed suit two months later. \u0026nbspAustralian historian Keith Vincent Smith told The Independent: “I can certainly say the Gweagal at Botany Bay are the rightful owners of the shield and spears taken from there by Joseph Banks and James Cook in 1770.” \u0026nbspIn a paper entitled Confronting Cook, Mr Smith describes how information about Cooman was passed down through generations, after\u0026nbspan Aboriginal woman’s account of what happened was documented in the 1840s.He said the shield is likely to be the same as the one seen in drawings from the time.Mr Kelly, who is visiting the UK for the fourth time in collaboration with pressure group BP Or Not BP? said he was amazed at what was on display at the British Museum.\u0026nbspDuring last year’s visit he said he took part in the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour’ to protest a controversial BP-sponsored exhibition of Iraqi artefacts. This week, he leads the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour: Colonialism, Carbon \u0026amp Cook” with speakers discussing “looted items” on display from\u0026nbspIraq, Palestine, Greece and Australia.\u0026nbspHe said: “For me, this tour is all about getting different cultures together because we’re all in it for that one cause. I think it’s a great opportunity for us to unite and to show the British People and British Museum there’s a real need for these items to be repatriated and we can make the world a better place if we did.”Created with Sketch.

That is what happened to Labour last night,” said David Lammy, a Labour MP in London.“We fudged and hedged on a people’s vote, hoping we could string voters along, but the bluff has been called.”Phil Wilson, a northeast MP, said: “The lesson for Labour is don’t sit on the fence. Show leadership and support a confirmatory ballot.”Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Margaret Hodge, another London MP, tweeted: “Election Lesson 1: if you don’t give people something to vote for then they will not vote for you.”And Owen Smith, a Wales MP and former leadership contender, said: “Our reward for bailing the Tories out on Brexit was to share the losses with them – to Lib Dems, Greens and others who are clear that they oppose Brexit.”The comment followed an extraordinary TV claim by Barry Gardiner, the shadow business secretary, that Labour was “trying to bail out” the Tories in order to deliver Brexit.The party lost a famous face when Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in the Blackadder series, announced he was quitting after 45 years over “duplicity on Brexit”, antisemitism and “because its leadership is complete s***”.But a defiant Mr Corbyn vowed to continue to seek a Brexit agreement, saying: “A deal has to be done, parliament has got to resolve this issue, I think that is very, very clear.”Many dismissed the swings to pro-EU parties as a traditional protest, which went to those parties in the absence of the Brexit Party and with Ukip too toxic, or simply not standing.However, Labour Remainers fear an even worse performance in the European elections in a fortnight, after Mr Corbyn crushed an attempt to commit him to a referendum on any Brexit deal.Voters furious about Brexit spoil their local election ballot papers Local election results could push May and Corbyn into a Brexit pactTories and Labour suffer Brexit fallout as voters turn elsewhereFarage confirms Brexit Party to contest Peterborough by-electionMay says students ‘priced out’ of EU by Brexit are better off in UKCross-party talks will resume on Tuesday, after the prime minister admitted she was ready to strike a deal\u0026nbspwith Labour based around a form of customs union.But the election results also provoked fresh trauma in the Tory party – which has even greater cause to fear the Euro polls, faced with a resurgent Nigel Farage at the head of his new Brexit Party.In extraordinarily candid comments, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, warned his “ided party” was set to lose power, while foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted to “a slap in the face”.Brexiteers Priti Patel, Bernard Jenkin and Crispin Blunt repeated their calls for the prime minister to resign, while David Amess – until now a May backer – demanded the party move against her “immediately”.The Tories lost around 40 councils and suffered in true-blue heartlands in the south, including Chelmsford, Somerset and Ms May’s backyard of Windsor and Maidenhead, where a majority of 38 was slashed to just five.Speaking at a Tory conference in Wales, the prime minister blamed the Brexit crisis, saying: “There was a simple message from yesterday’s elections to both us and the Labour Party – just get on and deliver Brexit.”Strikingly, many voters used the elections to physically register their protest at the state of politics, sharing images of voting slips with messages including ‘Get May out’, ‘Brexit betrayal’ and ‘Traitors’ written across them.Explaining why he spoiled his ballot, one Worcester voter said: “The major parties have been lying for three years straight about Brexit and, in a two-party system, neither of them deserve to be voted for at any level.”There were huge number of spoiled ballots in Great Yarmouth (968), Swindon (825), Basildon (796), Folkestone and Hythe (637), Tendring (600) and North Norfolk (563).The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Voters don’t reward any of these things.”Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, also questioned the prime minister’s future, saying only that she was the right person in Downing Street “for now”.He described the results as a slap in the face for both the main parties.\u0026nbsp“My heart goes out to conservative councillors who have lost their seats,” he said.The Tories, like Labour, won about 28 per cent of the vote – down 7 points on last year – suffering in southern heartlands including Chelmsford, Somerset and Ms May’s backyard of Windsor and Maidenhead.There were embarrassing defeats to the Liberal Democrats for the local councils in Somerset of leading Brexiteers Liam Fox, the trade secretary, and Jacob Rees-Mogg.Tory wins council seat by single ballot scrawled with word \u0027Brexit\u0027Corbyn ally says Labour trying to ‘bail out’ Tories over BrexitVoters furious about Brexit spoil their local election ballot papers Local election results could push May and Corbyn into a Brexit pactA general election projection by Sky News suggested the Tories would lose 33 seats – probably handing power to Labour in alliance with the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats.If Brexit remained unresolved at that point, it would almost certainly trigger a Final Say referendum as the price of the support of the Remain parties.Sir Eric became the latest senior Conservative to urge Ms May to choose that way out, saying: “I can’t believe I’m saying this, because I was absolutely opposed to a second referendum.“A clear choice has got to be put to the public in terms of where they want to go. Do they want Ms May’s deal, do they want to have Brexit without a period of transition, or do they want to stay in the European Union?”Speaking in Wales, the prime minister blamed the Brexit crisis for the Tory\u0027s poll failure, saying: “There was a simple message from yesterday\u0027s elections to both us and the Labour Party – just get on and deliver Brexit.”But the heckler, Stuart Davies, a Tory member and former councillor, demanded she quit. “I am furious at what she has done to our party. To put it bluntly, she is telling lies”, he said, pointing out she had said that the Uk would leave the EU on 29 March.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, as the overall results show, the victories were eclipsed by heavy losses elsewhere.\u0026nbspSome of the biggest defeats were in its former Essex and Lincolnshire heartlands: it parted with seven seats on Thurrock council and 12 in Boston.Ukip is now polling just around five per cent for the coming European Parliament elections – a contest it won with 26.6 per cent of the vote just five years ago.By contrast the Brexit party hit 30 per cent in one recent survey, more than any other party. If the same showing is replicated on results day, Ukip would struggle to remain even one MEP.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyUkip has struggled to hold onto local government seats in recent elections, despite making quite substantial gains in the 2010-15 parliament.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOverall the Conservatives were the biggest loser of the night, shedding at least 970\u0026nbsplosses according to the tally as of 4.30pm on Friday.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

who have never been quizzed by British cops.Cops moved the search to Bulgaria as they tried to find a woman in purple they wanted to speak to.On May , , it emerged that Portuguese police were hunting a sex fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask in relation to Maddies suspected kidnapping.In one of his previous cases, he broke into a British familys home and loomed over a seven-year-old girl who woke up and asked Is that you Daddy  and he replied Yes in a foreign accent, author Anthony Summers said in the Netflix doc.Detectives have discovered a creep carried out nearly  attacks within a -mile radius of the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz where Maddie vanished from  years ago today.He crept into Algarve properties rented by families and many victims were British.And a judicial source is reported to have confirmed the unnamed man was definitely in Portugal at the time the three-year-old suddenly disappeared.And the insider also alleged he was KNOWN to local cops and had previously been investigated on suspicion of involvement in paedophile cases.A chilling reconstruction features in the final episode of Netflixs recently released eight-part documentary The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000417521257-e1556658553350.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"if star needs cash wont be him","story":"Except, of course, it wasn’t the Transporter star. It was a scammer.The conman first made contact with her via a Facebook fan page dedicated to Derbyshire-born Jason who moved to LA about  years ago.“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s nice of him, talking to his fans’. I might have been star-struck then, I don’t know,” says the anonymous victim. Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do. And until the Government changes the education system, thousands of bored, disenfranchised kids will fail in it.WHILE sightseeing in Japan, Ed Sheeran bizarrely chose a full panda outfit in a bid to go incognito.But when he briefly removed it in a store, a fan clocked him and asked for a selfie .Still, nice to see that Ed recovered from the ordeal in time to run the London Marathon.What a showbiz trouper he is.BRITISH-born Michael Adebowale is the evil brute who killed and tried to decapitate soldier Lee Rigby in broad daylight.He is currently residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure in HMP Wakefield – aka “Monster Mansion” – where other lags see him as a top target, and he’s feeling an ickle bit scared, poor lamb.Consequently, he has asked for advice on how to move to a cushier jail in his parents’ home country of Nigeria.The answer, of course, should be a firm no.In the meantime, how refreshing to hear of a ­ruthless killer experiencing jail time that ­actually feels like a ­punishment for his heinous crime.WHEN it launched in , Instagram rapidly became the go-to place for those who wanted to “filter the s**t”out of their everyday lives.Suddenly, no one had any blemishes, they all resembled Elle Macpherson in a bikini and even their cofed and slightly startled dog looked like it had just stepped off the winner’s podium at Crufts.It became known as “Instasham” and, along with other social media sites, took a hefty share of blame for the worrying increase in poor self-esteem among young girls who felt they couldn’t match up to the images of perfection being posted by their idols.Now, riding the waves of a welcome sea change in attitude, media-savvy social media “influencers” are falling over themselves to show how imperfect they are.“Just woken up” selfies with no make-up are a favourite, along with close-ups of spots, stretch marks, cellulite, and tummy rolls . . . all with earnest captions reminding us that we’re not all ­perfect.Undoubtedly, it is a well-meaning step towards helping their young fans realise that whatever face or body you’re born with, it’s better to work at loving who you are and not what you look like.But surely, true progress is when a visible blemish tummy roll stretch mark is deemed so normal that it doesn’t even warrant comment Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her last deployment to sea was in .She is the daughter of a former paratrooper and she was even named after the Leander-class frigate HMS Penelope - which played a key role in defeating the Argentines in the Falklands War.Penny, , also represents a constituency packed with service voters in Portsmouth North.She has enjoyed a steady rise up the pecking order and will move to the Ministry of Defence after  months in charge of Britain’s bloated £ billion a year foreign aid budget, where her main challenge was dealing with the fallout from the Oxfam sex scandal.And her latest promotion will propel the ambitious minister’s chances of reaching the very top.Ms Mordaunt had a dficult upbringing after her mother died of breast cancer when she was .The same year her father was diagnosed with cancer - leaving her and her twin brother to care for their younger brother.She paid her way through college by taking a job as a magician’s assistant, which involved her being ‘sawn in half’.Penny enjoyed a colourful time as a backbench MP - and first won notoriety outside the House of Commons for being on reality TV ing show Splash!.Despite an early KO for a spectacular belly flop, her pluck won her respect from fellow MPs and constituents after she gave her £, appearance fee to local and military charities.At Westminster, three years ago Penny became only the second woman to propose the loyal address after the Queen’s Speech — and the first to talk balls.She had MPs in stitches recalling the time on her naval training she was part of a course on caring for her “penis and testicles”.“Fascinating though it was,” she said, “I felt the lecture and practical demonstration failed to appreciate some of us were issued with the incorrect kit.”But her use of colourful language came back to bite her when she confessed to saying “cock” six times and “lay” or “laid” five times in a Commons debate to win a bet with Navy friends.David Cameron promoted Penny into the Government in , making her first a Local Government minister and then an Armed Forces minister — which she called her dream job. Theresa May moved her to Minister for the Disabled when she became PM.Passionate Brexiteer Penny has committed one major political gaffe, when she wrongly claimed Britain would not be able to veto Turkey joining the EU, which got her a furious dressing-down from then boss Mr Cameron.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it was a bad night for Labour too.I think there was a simple message from yesterdays elections to both us and the Labour party - just get on and deliver Brexit.On a visit to Trafford - one of just a handful of Labour gains as the party lost six councils overall - Jeremy Corbyn said: I wanted us to do better, of course.Weve lost some seats across the country, of course I acknowledge that - weve also had swings to Labour in a number of places and also gained seats in several places.Labour failed to make the gains they wanted in key areas - and lost councils such as Darlington, Walsall and Hartlepool.Meanwhile the Lib Dems gained control of ten councils and added more than  seats. And hundreds more independent candidates won than when the same seats were contested four years ago.Neither Nigel Farages Brexit Party nor the pro-EU Change UK was standing in the local elections, and turnout was expected to be very low.But a reported , angry voters spoiled their ballot papers, many in protest at Brexit delays.If the results were mirrored in a general election, the Tories and Labour would be tied on  per cent each with the Lib Dems winning  per cent.Polls closed at pm on Thursday in  council areas of England, as well as the whole of Northern Ireland - and results have been coming in throughout Friday. So far:Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis said this morning it had been a tough night but he urged Labour to stop up and respect the referendum.And Jeremy Hunt admitted the results look like a slap in the face for both the main parties, while Scottish Tories chief Ruth Davidson said: It seems to be a plague on both your houses.Tory MP Vicky Ford said she was gutted to see Chelmsford council go to the Liberal Democrats overnight. Its been brutal, she said.Party veteran Sir David Amess blasted: The results are absolutely dreadful - and called on the PM to quit as soon as possible.Ex-minister Mark Francois warned the Euro elections later this month would be even more disastrous, saying: In a tsunami the sea goes out, and comes crashing back in.This is the sea going out. May  will be an absolute tsunami.But grassroots Tories across the country vented their fury and disappointment with their party after a dficult night for them.Tony Berry, the leader of the Tories on Cotswold District Council, who have lost the council to Liberal Democrats after  years in charge, blasted: I would ask [Theresa May] to consider her position very carefully.He blamed Brexit and professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country.Even top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg was hit by the backlash - as the Tory councillor for his Somerset neighbourhood was beaten by a Lib Dem.Defeated Tim Warren said last night that people wanted to punish us for a lack of action in Government.There needs to be a change in action, he stressed. The electorate have spoken tonight and they have been very angry.A clearly frustrated Donna Jones, the Conservative group leader on Portsmouth City Council said: I think [Mrs May] needs to take a look at how many councillors we’ve lost overnight, wake up in the morning and think about how she thinks the Conservative party needs to put its best foot forward.And Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: People are very disillusioned, that the country made a decision and the politicians havent implemented.[Theresa May] still has a degree of personal sympathy but people think it’s time for a change.They can see she’s lost the plot, she’s not in control of events.Ex-Cabinet minister Priti Patel said the pitul message she was getting on the doorstep from voters showed her it was time for the PM to go.People have very categorically said she is part of the problem, she said.Our party leadership needs to make some very, very serious decisions. Many of my constituents have said we need a change of leadership. Perhaps the time has come for that.Labour were tipped to pick up seats from the Tories, but so far havent been making any gains.The news will be a blow to the partys hopes of forcing a General Election and taking power in No - as Labour are nowhere near on the right course.Tory sources said at this point under Ed Miliband the party had gained  seats, meaning Mr Corbyn is trailing far behind.But Labour stressed that they were a tough set of elections in mostly areas that leaned towards the Tories - and there were lots of local factors at play too.The partys vow to back a second referendum appeared to have put voters off in the North and Midlands as their share of the vote took a tumble.But it picked up some votes in the South - where some voters are keen on the idea of another vote and remaining in the EU - and secured control of Trafford council.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said this morning: So far message from local elections - Brexit - sort it. Message received.His words will be seen as a huge hint Labour will be on board to do a deal with the Tories to force Brexit through in the coming weeks.MP Ruth Smeeth said it wasnt good news in her area of Stoke on Trent last night. She said: The leadership needs to look at these results very carefully. This is a strong leave area and my constituents just don’t trust us to deliver.We need clear messaging from the top. Messing around just isnt working. I want to deliver Brexit for my constituents.Furious Sunderland council leader Graeme Miller said the party’s Brexit policy was to blame for losing  seats in his patch.He said: Sunderland voted as a city to leave in June , and having had a Labour message across the city from MPs saying we need to be having a second referendum, people in Sunderland have said ‘we are just not accepting that.One MP told Sky earlier: You stand in the middle of the road and you get run over in both directions. Corbyn must go. He is killing our party and our country.The Lib Dems declared victory today - leader Vince Cable said: “The Liberal Democrats are the big winners of this year’s elections, with already our best result for over  years and more gains expected today.“Voters have sent a clear message that they no longer have confidence in the Conservatives, but they are also refusing to reward Labour while the party preicates on the big issue of the day: Brexit.The results could trigger a fresh challenge to Mrs May as panicked Tories guard against disaster in the EU elections on May  as well as the next General Election.Counting will continue well into Friday in some areas, so the full results wont be known until this afternoon or evening.Chorley -

in some of their most traditional seats.The Liberal Democrats have reason to cheer this morning as they turned Chelmsford and the Cotswolds yellow again.And the Tories have lost more than a dozen councils of their own as voters lost patience with them.Some of that will be out of sheer frustration with the Tories, but some of it will be from Remainers determined to use the ongoing Brexit battle to push for a second referendum.Tories are, understandably, irritated with last night’s results, which have them down more than  seats.Grassroots activists and MPs are renewing their calls for Mrs May to go this morning, saying she’s the reason for the bloodbath in the polls.But in reality it’s far better than the numbers which had been predicted - partly this is good expectations management for the Tories.Meanwhile, Labour have suffered from huge drops in their vote in their Northern and Midland heartlands  - with many votes going to independent candidates instead.They’ve lost Hartlepool, Wirral, Bolsolver and Walsall councils overnight, and only managed to gain one - Trafford.They’ve picked up a few chunks of votes in the South - possibly because of their promise to fight for a second referendum - but it’s not outweighed by the amount they’ve lost in the North.MPs said it was proof that their strategy of sitting on the fence to keep everyone happy just wasn’t working, and they needed to show they could be trusted to deliver Brexit. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/as-graphic-election-v15-1845.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local election results 2019 who won council seats in my area","story":"Thousands of results have come in overnight and the ballots are still being counted across England. Tories and Labour both did poorly but Lib Dems and Greens swept up more seats in the local electionsTories have lost more than two dozen councils and over , seats so far as furious voters slam them for not taking us out of the EU yetLabour are several councils down and have seen a drop of more seats as their position on the fence fails to win them any more support.Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats are up more than  and Independents had a great night as they demand Brexit be stopped altogether.Theresa May has been desperate not to talk about Brexit but fuming voters spoiled their ballots to show their fury at her.The poor results for the Tories could be even worse at the EU elections later this month -

Not even big-hearted Brad has pockets that deep.He is still in the middle of a messy and drawn out orce battle with estranged we Angelina Jolie and he has all that maintenance and child support to take into account.Brad and Jenner were the ultimate golden couple at the height of their power and beauty when they split almost  years ago.It depends on what version of events you believe, but they either called time on their relationship before Brad fell head over heels in lust with Angelina on the set of Mr And Mrs Smith, or she was the other woman who swooped in and bedazzled him.I don’t happen to think you can “steal” someone’s lover or partner, and there must surely have been some flaws in Brad and Jenner’s marriage for him to have taken up with Angelina in the first place.It has to be said, though, that the timeline has always been rather fuzzy.Angelina did once say in an interview that Mr And Mrs Smith was a chance for their children to watch Mum and Dad falling in love, and that they had all sat down in front of the TV as a family to watch the film on DVD.This prompted Jenner to hit back, albeit in a classy and dignied fashion, saying she had no idea anything was going on at that time, and Angelina’s remarks were “uncool” and “inappropriate”.Jenner has never really vented any feelings of hurt and anger in public, and always behaved like a lady. I do wonderBrad ever laments the loss of the uncomplicated woman he once loved so very much.For a time, Brad and Angelina appeared to be extremely happy with their brood of children and stellar film careers, but no one knows what really goes on behind closed doors and it all started to unravel for them almost three years ago.There were accusations and recriminations on both sides in a bloody war of attrition that really should have reached a truce by this stage.Interestingly, both Brad and Jenner are now single, though he was linked to Charlize Theron in January.Her short-lived marriage to American actor Justin Theroux went belly-up last year.The rumour mill went into hyperdrive when Brad turned up at Jenner’s th bash in February and the two were seen to be getting on well.There would be something very satisfying about this ridiculously good-looking, hugely successful famous ex-couple getting back together, but I’m not sureyou can ever reheat the souffle.Perhaps you can eventually become friends, but whether or not you can forgive heartaches, betrayals and past pain is debatable.Sadly, I don’t think we will be celebrating Brad and Jen the sequel any time soon.THIS time last year my lovely friend and colleague Helen Addis was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the world went from colour to black and white.She is only , has three young kids and her cancer was particularly ugly and aggressive.Twelve months down the line, after gruelling treatment, Helen has somehow transformed her devastating diagnosis into a real positive.Thanks to her courage and tenacity, and her cracking good idea, she will actually be saving lives.Helen’s simple but effective plan is to have a sticker on the mirror of changing rooms in shops and gyms showing what changes to look out for in your breasts, as well as details of my colleague Dr Hilary Jones’s guide to checking online.So when you are checking yourself out in a new outfit, you can also remember to check your boobs.For more information see itv lorraineTHE birth of any new baby is a cause of joy and celebration.For the parents, it’s emotional, uplting, overwhelming and also a tiny bit scary.Harry and Meghan will be no dferent to any other mum and dad because, unlike domestic appliances, babies don’t come with instruction manuals.The royal couple will be nervous about the first bath and will anxiously listen out for their little one breathing during the night.Despite all the expert advice they can count on, they will still be typical, nervous, first-time parents.While I totally respect their right to a certain degree of privacy during the later stages of pregnancy and the birth, I do think it was a mistake to fly so low under the radar at this time.The most dangerous development for any member of the Royal Family isn’t rampant republicanism. Instead, the big threat is indference.If people don’t care any more about the royals then the whole fragile monarchy could crumble like a stale meringue.Obviously, just like all new mums and dads Harry and Meghan will want and need time to adjust to being a family.It would, however, be a shame , as has been forecast, they decide to completely withdraw from public le for the foreseeable future apart from some very cute Instagram posts.There’s a danger people will shrug their shoulders and find other online influencers, or fail to turn up in all weathers to line the streets and give hearty cheers when Harry and Meghan eventually do resurface.Apart from the Queen, no member of the Royal Family can take the adulation, support or even tolerance of the British public for granted.Harry and Meghan have the potential to be a tremendous asset to the royals and there’s huge affection for both of them, especially now.They can build on this and make a better future for all the world’s children, as well as their little one.MADONNA kicked ass at the Billboard Awards in Vegas earlier this week.She showed all the young pretenders that there really is only one true Queen Of Pop – and she’s a -year-old woman with chipmunk cheeks and the tight, muscular body of a -year-old pole dancer.I love her new ­single, Medellin, and I adored that ­Billboard performance complete with state-of-the-art Madonna holograms.It made everyone  look a little bit ordinary.There have been many imitators over the years, but there is only one Madonna. No one  even comes close.TONY SLATTERY was once a constant presence on our screens.He seemed to be on every single TV  show and had the same sort of manic comic genius displayed by the late, great Robin Williams.Tony largely disappeared from public le in the late Nineties and endured a long struggle with mental health issues as well as booze and drug addiction. At one point he admits he was spending four grand a week on cocaine and vodka.I often wondered what had happened to Tony, and it was heartening to see him popping up on This Morning this week, talking openly about being bipolar and living with depression.He’s older, greyer and wiser, and very lucky to have the support of his partner of  years, actor Mark Michael Hutchinson.It’s just a real shame that at a time when Tony really needed help, talking about mental health was still taboo and could end your career. Thank the Lord things are slowly changing for the better.I wish Tony all the best as he rebuilds his career and looks forward to performing again at the Edinburgh Festival this summer. The world needs his funny, witty and honest take on le.SACKED Defence Secretary Gavin ­Williamson has sworn on his ­children’s lives that he didn’t leak ­Cabinet secrets.That’s a bold and vehement statement that no loving dad would ever make lightly.Whatever the truth, it’s another example of the utter shambles at the heart of Westminster, and how worrying that no one is the least bit surprised or shocked by these allegations.TODAY is an important one for Star Wars fans, who celebrate the date as “May The th Be With You”.See what they did there I’m actually more concerned about the magnicent sci-fi TV series The Orville, with no word yet on whether the genius creation of Seth ­MacFarlane has been renewed for a third series.I’d love fellow geeks to put me out of my misery and confirm whether we can look forward to more episodes of a show that captures the true essence of my beloved Star Trek in a far more affectionate and authentic way than its rival Star Trek: Discovery.It would be a travestywe weren’t able to boldly go on new adventures with the funny, exasperating, lovable and entertaining crew of The Orville.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wages still too low.But the PM could hammer home our historically low unemployment, record high employment, pay now rising much faster than inflation, the deficit finally reduced to manageable levels, the richest now paying a higher percentage of tax than ever.She could talk up the Tories slashing the number of workless households which shamefully built up under Labour’s welfare culture.

It gives us hope.Kate, wearing a purple puffa jacket and black jeans and with her hair freshly highlighted and trimmed, fought back tears during the service as children, including her -year-old twins Sean and Amelie, lit candles for Maddie and other lost youngsters.The gathering had been due to take place at the war memorial in the McCanns home village of Rothley, Leicestershire, where a candle burns around the clock as a beacon of hope for the world’s most famous missing child.But it was moved into the nearby local Baptist Church to avoid expected rains showers.Vicar the Rev Rob Gladstone, who led the prayers, opened the service by saying: “A warm and a very dry welcome. Even after twelve years of hoping and praying we trust that God has not abandoned us or Madeleine.We come together again to show our support for Kate and Gerry, for other parents of missing children and young people, to help keep alive the tune of hope which persists through all the storms and sorrows.”Kate chose not to say any words publicly - Gerry normally addresses the anniversary well wishers - but she later thanked the near -strong crowd inidually for their continued support.Brian - the brother of Kate’s mum Susan Healy who was at a prayer service in her home city of Liverpool - said: “We are all very grateful to those who turned out this evening in less than pleasant conditions.

This is especially the case when the Government is barely ing, bitterly ided and responsible for nine years of punitive local government cuts. There are still several dozen councils to declare but as I write the  Tories have lost  seats and  councils, Labour is down  councillors and has lost control of three councils , while the Lib Dems have gained  seats and eight councils and the Greens are up  seats. Jeremy Corbyn had hoped that voters would park Brexit and be receptive to Labour’s promises to rebuild areas worst hit by Tory austerity.  Instead voters looked at the two major parties and  decided to cast a pox on both their houses. The Conservatives have been punished for their glaring failure to deliver Brexit and general incompetence. For Labour they have discovered the hard way that voters also resent equivocation. As Nye Bevan once said: “We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run down.” These elections should sound the death knell for Corbyn’s policy of constructive ambiguity which has seen Labour try to appeal to both leave and remain voters. By sitting on the fence, Labour has been punished by remain voters in the south who have gone to the Lib Dems and the Greens and by leave voters in its traditional heartlands of Bolsover and Sunderland.  Questions will also be raised about whether Mr Corbyn’s leadership may also have repelled previously loyal Labour voters.Labour activists says the Labour leaderaposs suitability for office came up repeatedly on the doorstep.

But Labour failed to seize the spoils from the Toriesapos loss - with huge gains instead going to the Lib Dems, who boasted of their best night ever. Voters declared a plague on both your houses, polling expert John Curtice said. One Tory MP, Vicky Ford, was left in tears as her party suffered an astonishing wipeout in Chelmsford - where the Lib Dems took control overturning a -seat majority.     More than , seats were up for election across England outside London - the vast majority in already strong Tory shires, which Labour were going to struggle to win. Local factors will always be partly to blame, and thereaposs a mixed picture. Labour did well in parts of the South and Trafford - but lost control of symbolic northern Hartlepool, Bolsover and Wirral, places where the party should have been able to consolidate. Thereaposs also much more to come, with the other half of councils only declaring during Friday afternoon. But Jonathan Carr-West, Chief Executive of the Local Government Information Unit, said: “It’s looking like a pretty grim night for the Conservatives and Labour and a very good night for the Lib Dems.” Labour MPs were quick to blame the partyaposs middle-ground approach to Brexit.    Labour MP Jess Phillips fumed: I canapost help but think that the public like a clear message eventhey donapost always agree with it. One Labour MP told the Mirror: Sit on the fence and you get splinters. Jeremy Corbyn said he was very sorry for losses and accepted Brexit was a factor. But as usual the way to get off that fence will cause dferences. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour must now drive Brexit forward, saying: So far message from local elections - aposBrexit - sort itapos. Message received. . Tories lost over ,  over Brexit - and thataposs VERY bad news for them in the EU elections  Itaposs been a bruising night for the Conservative Party as they lost more than  seats. The Tories lost control of heartland working-class Home Counties councils including Basildon, Southend-on-Sea and Folkestone  Hythe. Commuter-belt St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield also fell out of blue control. They also lost control of Broxtowe - home to the Remainer MP Anna Soubry - amid Labour gains. Tory activists admitted Brexiteers stayed at home amid frustration over leaving the EU. And that allowed Remain parties to sweep the board. That doesnapost bode well for the Tories ahead of the EU elections on May . Next time the Tories will be up against Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party for the first time, which could seize blue seats. Bath and North East Somerset Tory Tim Warren, who lost his own seat, said: The electorate have spoken tonight and they have been very angry. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson told Sky News: I think the message is pretty clear. It seems to be a plague on both your houses to the Conservatives and the Labour Party, who they see as a block on finding some sort of resolution to Brexit. So, we know that the talks are ongoing hopefully, this will focus minds in the room and, hopefully, we can get past the impasse that we are in and move on to the next stage. . It may not be bad enough to force out Theresa May  It was a catatrsrophic result for the Conservatives but Theresa May has survived crushing embarassment before and nothing seems to end her career. So will this be the straw that breaks the camelaposs back  Maybe but Mrs May doesnapost seem likely to move for anyone. Tory Brexiteer Priti Patel said people had made clear Theresa May was part of the problem and there needs to be a change of leadership. And yes, there is a grassroots movement against her.  But others will move to paint the result as not a disaster and keep the PM in office. Brexit Minister James Cleverly said: If it was  [losses] rather than , I would be happy with that. With the EU elections in just three weeks looking like they could go much worse for the Tories, MPs may wait until then to move against Mrs May. Moving in an election campaign is not smart. Tory Crispin Blunt issued a fresh call for Theresa May to quit. While Brexiteer Tory Sir Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: If the Conservative Party doesnapost mend its ways pretty quickly, the Conservative Party is going to be toast. Tory chairman Brandon Lewis admitted the results showed people are frustrated with the impasse in Parliament. . Labour are NOT profiting from the Tory failure  Labour have been in opposition for nine years but are not making the kind of gains you might expect. Jeremy Corbynaposs party had some big symbolic wins, finally seizing the once-blue Manchester island of Trafford back into red control. There were some southern gains too, such as six seats in Folkestone and Hythe. And Labour gained one seat in Peterborough - which is staging a crucial by-election on June  - as the Tories lost it to No Overall Control. Plymouth, Southampton and Reading also consolidated previous advances. But Labour also lost control of northern stronghold Bolsover, home to legendary Brexiteer Labour MP Dennis Skinner. The party failed to gain control of Midlands Brexit stomping ground Stoke-on-Trent. Hartlepool was lost from Labour control as was Wirral - where the Labour share of the vote was down %, according to the BBC. And an eye-watering nine seats were lost in northern Labour heartland - and Leave-voting area - Sunderland. Labouraposs Shadow Local Government Secretary, Andrew Gwynne, admitted undoubtedly Brexit played a part in the results. He added: There has been that sense of frustration, and I’ve picked it up on the doorstep. Labour sources said it had been a tough set of elections in mainly rural and shire areas that favour the Tories. In others, like Sunderland, local factors were at play. . Lib Dems boasted of their best ever night in a aposRemain backlashapos  Lib Dems could not contain their glee after picking up a string of seats and gaining control of key areas - including Brexiteer Tory Jacob Rees-Moggaposs back yard. They also gained Winchester, North Norfolk and Cotswold. And the Lib Dem wipeout of the Tories in Chelmsford, overturning a -seat majority to take control of the council, was so whopping it left the local MP Vicky Ford in tears. With predictions the Lib Dems could gain as many as  seats, MP Layla Moran claimed it was the best local election results for the party since  - in the aftermath of the Iraq War.  With more than half of councils still to declare, Lib Dem MP Sir Ed Davey claimed the result was equivalent to our best strides forward ever in our history. He added: People have been frustrated with the appalling Tory Government, who have let them down not just on Brexit but with cuts to police and schools, and a split opposition with such poor leadership. They have been crying out for a strong alternative. The Liberal Democrats have proven we are that strong alternative to the Tories and Labour .  The Green Party and Independents had an excellent night as voters vent their protest against the main two parties, polling guru John Curtice said. The expert said it was one of the Greensapos best performances ever. It comes in the wake of the Extinction Rebellion protests, which have raised awareness of climate issues. But the rise of Independents and small parties also recognises an anger at the main, establishment parties. Independents gained  seats in Bolsover and gained North Kesteven council from the Tories. And Labour lost the Middlesbrough mayoral election by a huge margin to an independent businessman. . Both parties are being hammered in their heartlands - with a North-South ide  Each of the two main parties was hammered in its heartlands. The same picture keeps being highlighted - Labour losses are worse in the North, and Tory losses are worst in the South. As dawn broke with around  councils declared, politics professor at Manchester University Rob Ford claimed the north saw a swing of % against the Tories and % against Labour. Yet in the Midlands there was no change for Labour, as opposed to a % drop for the Midlands. And in the South, Labour gained .%, as opposed to a .% Tory drop - with a whopping . point swing from the Conservatives to Jeremy Corbynaposs Party. . And fury is mounting over Brexit  Labour MPs claim the party is struggling because it hasnapost come down firmly on one side over Brexit. The party is continuing to pursue its own Brexit plan, while keeping a second EU referendum as an option on the table in case needed, but not in all cases. Labour MP Jess Phillips reacted by saying her partyaposs position on Brexit had failed.  Iaposm off to bed as have to be up at am to do the school run, she tweeted. My final word is that I think our position on Brexit has failed. Bravery is needed. If you combine kindness and effectiveness with a bit of grit most people will respect you even when they donapost always agree. Fellow Labour MP Wes Streeting said losses in Sunderland and Liverpool demonstrated that looking both ways on Brexit isnapost doing Labour any good. Furious Sunderland council leader Graeme Miller said: “Sunderland voted as a city to leave in June , and having had a Labour message across the city from MPs saying we need to be having a second referendum, people in Sunderland have said ‘we are just not accepting that. “I have lost  councillors tonight because of that Brexit situation, where the Brexit message has stepped into and over local politics.” Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner admitted Labour’s message on Brexit was “complex” and could leave some of its Brexiteer supporters fearing the worst. “When people think democracy is going to be traduced in the way you’ve talked about, naturally a city like Sunderland is going to be rightly upset,” he said. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: So far message from local elections - aposBrexit - sort itapos. Message received.

Theresa May is facing another uprising in her party after a string of defeats in her Home Counties heartlands as local councillors are punished for chaos over Brexit. Losses include an astonishing wipeout of the Toriesapos -seat majority in Chelmsford, handing power to anti-Brexit Lib Dems and leaving an MP in tears. But Labour also lost seats and lost its grip on key councils as MPs warned Jeremy Corbyn had failed to give a clear Brexit message to the nation. It was a plague on both your houses as Labour took back symbolic jewel Trafford and gained Amber Valley and Calderdale - but lost control of northern heartlands Hartlepool, Wirral and Bolsover.    With all but a few seats declared, an analysis of the national votes by the BBC suggested that the vote share between the two parties was tied on % a piece - suggesting the deadlocked parliament might represent what the country really thinks about British politics. Meanwhile Brexiteers vented their fury at the main parties by spoiling masses of ballot papers and, in some cases, staying at home. Jeremy Corbyn said he was very sorry for the losses and accepted Brexit was a factor. Yet Theresa May did not say the S-word even after a Tory heckler shouted resign! at the Prime Minister. Meanwhile the Lib Dems claimed their best night ever, taking councils including Bath and North East Somerset in Jacob Rees-Moggaposs back yard.    And it was a good night for protest votes for Independents, as well as the Greens who experts said were enjoying their best local elections night so far. There was a mixed picture overnight in the  local elections - where , seats in mainly Tory areas were up for grabs. The Tories had the most to lose, and lose they did, with Home Counties councils Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Folkestone  Hythe, St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield slipping away. They also lost control of Broxtowe - home to the Remainer MP Anna Soubry - amid Labour gains. But spinning Tories tried to downplay the disaster. Brexit Minister James Cleverly said: If it was  rather than , I would be happy with that.  Jeremy Corbynaposs party had some big symbolic wins, finally seizing the once-blue Manchester island of Trafford back into red control. There were some southern gains too, such as six seats in Folkestone and Hythe. And Labour gained one seat in Peterborough - which is staging a crucial by-election on June  - as the Tories lost it to No Overall Control. Plymouth, Southampton and Reading also consolidated previous advances. But Labour also lost control of northern Bolsover, home to legendary Brexiteer Labour MP Dennis Skinner.  The party failed to gain control of Midlands Brexit stomping ground Stoke-on-Trent. Hartlepool was lost from Labour control as was Wirral - where the Labour share of the vote was down %, according to the BBC.

Local elections don#xt naturally attract the same number of voters as the much bigger event of a general election. When that#xs added to the election fatigue triggered by so many polls in recent years this is not expected to be a great night for turn out. Jonathan Carr-West, Chief Executive, Local Government Information Unitsaid: #xCAs polls close in these local elections, tribute must be paid to the thousands of council employees who made today happen and will be working tirelessly through the night to ensure each and every vote is counted. Their efforts often go unrecognised but they are the unsung heroes of our local democracy. #xCLocal elections are often talked about in terms of turnout. In years like this one, where they don#xt coincide with a general election or a European election on the same day, turnout is often as low as just a third of the electorate. However, it is dficult to tell how much election fatigue from last two years will impact the results. Will the fallout of Brexit drive people to the polls  We are hearing that a lot of voters are staying home which could be bad news for the Conservatives.#xCFor the Conservatives anything short of disaster will feel like a reasonable result. They#xre predicted to lose hundreds of seats but the consolation could be that the profile of these elections means they shouldn#xt lose control of too many councils. Labour will hope to consolidate their hold on the Northern politan councils and take full control of places like Calderdale and Trafford. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats should pick up anti Brexit votes and win seats but start from too far back to take over many councils though they may have their eyes on Stockport.And while there is always a temptation to view local elections as a gloried opinion poll, we shouldn#xt forget that local elections are about real issues that impact our homes, care of older people, school places, children#xs services, libraries, streets and refuse collection.

An analysis of the national votes by the BBC suggested that the vote share between the two parties was tied on % a piece - suggesting the deadlocked parliament might represent what the country really thinks about British politics. Meanwhile the Lib Dems claimed their best night ever, taking councils including Bath and North East Somerset in Jacob Rees-Moggaposs back yard. And it was a good night for protest votes for Independents, as well as the Greens who experts said were enjoying their best local elections night so far.

Voters turned their back on the big two parties in favour of the Greens, Lib Dems and independent candidates. While this was a disappointing night for Labour we should not lose sight of the fact the biggest losers were the Tories who suffered the worst council results of any party since . Voters delivered a damning verdict on a Government which has run out of steam, lacks compassion and has failed in its overriding task of delivering Brexit. Labour’s failure to make headway should prompt some soul searching in Jeremy Corbyn’s team.    The party should be especially concerned it lost ground in its former bastions of Bolsover, Hartlepool, Burnley and Middlesbrough. Winning control of Trafford and the Amber Valley are a consolation but these gains cannot disguise the fact that Labour needs to do more to appeal to voters outside the big cities. While there is a way forward for Labour, the same cannot be said of Theresa May’s Conservatives. This is a threadbare administration which has no plan for Brexit and has abandoned any pretence it is governing in the national interest. The Tory hammering was entirely deserved.

Researchers at University of Manchester have teamed up with Boots Soltan, to calculate the exposure risks of kids playing outside across  of the biggest cities. A survey of , parents has revealed the hours children play outside in each of the cities between March and August – the results of which have been combined with the total levels of erythema-effectiveUV radiation in those cities for , measured in units of standard erythema dose . Surprisingly, the data revealed that millions of kids who live in areas with less annual UV radiation can be more at risk of permanent sun damagethey spend longer outside without sun protection, than those living in sunnier locations. The UofM found children in Southampton, who play outside for an average of  hours across the six month spring summer period are most at risk of sun damage, as the UV radiation levels are also at their highest on the south coast.    While kids in Bristol – playing outside for  hours where annual UV radiation levels are  SED – are in the second highest ‘at risk’ area. But shockingly, a fth of parents in Southampton and Bristol don’t ever use sun lotion on their kids in the UK – despite living in the two areas where they are at the highest risk of sun damage. Children living in Belfast will spend  hours – the equivalent of nine solid days – playing outside during spring and summer with annual UV radiation levels of  SED, putting them in the top three locations for sunburn risk.    Professor Ann Webb at the University of Manchester said: “The potential risk of sunburn depends on how strong the sun is, and how long unprotected skin is exposed to that sun. “We have used the erythema-effectiveUV radiation in sunlight across the UK in  with data on how long children spend outside at selected locations to determine the potential for sunburn at each place. “This cannot tell us whether anyone will get a sunburn because that also depends on inidual behaviour and skin type. However, we can use the data to compare dferent places across the UK to see where children are most likely to get sunburn. “This is called the relative risk of sunburn and we have compared each city to the average of all thirteen cities for which we have data. Cities with a value more than . have a higher than average risk of sunburn, those with values less than one have a lower than average risk of sunburn.  In contrast, children in Birmingham and Newcastle are at the least risk of sun damage due to shorter times outside, and one of the lower annual UV levels, respectively Those in Birmingham will play outside for just under  hours between March and August, where annual UV is  SED– with  per cent of parents neglecting to think about sun care protection. In Newcastle, kids spend up to  hours outside and are exposed to annual UV radiation levels of  SED. Children in Manchester spend the least amount of time outside of the UK cities studied, and although the UV radiation levels are moderate, this puts them in the bottom three locations for risk.The Soltan study also investigated attitudes towards sun protection across the UK and found one in six parents don’t routinely apply sun protection on their children during the summer months – whatever the weather .More than a third of children will be found playing in the park without sun protection, while just under half of parents send their children to school without any thought of the weather – resulting in millions of kids spending time outside at the time of peak UV without protection. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than half of parents take sun care more seriously when abroad – correctly believing the sun is stronger in countries like Spain, however they don’t realise the risk of permanent sun damage also exists at home. As a result three in  parents also won’t bother putting sun lotion on their child on the beach, or in the back garden.  And one third of parents won’t bother reaching for protection unless their children are going to be outside for longer than two hours at a time. However, even those parents who are slapping on the sun cream often don’t know what to choose to make sure their little ones are fully protected. Forty-five per cent don’t understand the importance of five star ratings, which indicate the UVA protection of a sunscreen, and a further seven in  don’t know the dference between UVA and UVB.And while half of those polled by  OnePoll  are happy to use sun lotion with an SPF of +, one in six parents usually opt for an SPF factor of  or less.Clare O’Connor, Boots Soltan suncare expert, added: “Obviously parents are already thinking about sunscreen but we’re encouraging them to make sun protection a top priority this summer, at home as well as abroad. While we can feel and see some parts of the sun’s rays, UVA and UVB rays are invisible. It’s these invisible UVA and UVB rays, however, that have visible effects on the skin such as sun damage and premature ageing. Once the skin is pink, damage has been done. “The good news is that, with proper use of sun protection, these effects can be very easily avoided. As children start to enjoy the warmer weather, spending more time out in the sunshine, we want to emphasise how essential regular application of a high SPF sunscreen that that also protects you against UVA is - every day and throughout the day.”  British cities in order of risk  total of UV radiation— Relative Risk of sunburn**Southampton —.  — .

In May  my elder brother Vic, then , made a very shrewd prediction. He warned on the letters page: “Watching the election of Britain’s first woman Prime Minister I was reminded of the words of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain’s first ever Prime Minister, who in , said, ‘Today you are ringing your bells but tomorrow you’ll be wringing your hands!’” Vic’s prophetic words were echoed in the Mirror’s front page following her election  years ago today, when we urged her: “It would be a disasterwe became confirmed as two nations, industrially, politically and socially.” But she didn’t listen to us. She never did. The woman who famously promised: “Where there is discord, may we bring harmony... where there is despair, may we bring hope” was deaf to those who challenged her fanatical neoliberal worldview. Which was why, for vast swathes of this country, her  years in power brought only discord, despair and hopelessness on a brutal scale.    She launched a seismic sht in wealth to the rich, broke-up traditional industries and working-class communities, sold our assets, attacked local councils, the welfare state and unions and left Britain more deeply and dangerously ided than it has ever been.Brexit looks like a hippy love-in by comparison.Ah, say her apostles, but Britain was the Sick Man of Europe by the mid-s, and we needed her to save us from bankruptcy. That’s not how I remember it, nor the New Economics Foundation. Its statisticians proved that  was the best year on record for equality of incomes and quality of le in this country. When she was elected in , under-investment, poor industrial relations and the effects of the global oil crisis had left inflation high and the economy slumping. However there were plenty of jobs, wages were growing and for the first time in many working-class families’ history, kids, like me, were going to university. But Thatcher and her paymasters realised this equality lark had gone too far so she let the free market rip, slashed taxes and regulations and helped the rich fill their boots. For the economy as a whole, her economic miracle was a myth.During her time in power, only in  and  did the UK exceed the economic growth witnessed under Labour in . Only in  and  did her policies produce a surplus budget.   And every year unemployment was higher than under any Labour government since the s. From  to  it stood at more than three million. The true figure was actually higher due to Thatcher’s cynical policy of switching people to disability benefits to keep the numbers down. Numbers paid for by North Sea oil which could have helped re-invigorate the industrial heartlands she was strangling. But that did not appeal to her. She wrote off those jobs and heartlands. And cared not a jot for the shocking human cost. In her contempt for those less fortunate she tore society apart, with inner-city riots in places like Toxteth, Brixton, Handsworth and Moss Side and poll tax riots across the country, book-ending her callous reign. Throughout the s many families were scarred with unemployment, suicide, shattered self-esteem, house repossessions, depression, drugs and orce. She wrecked the chances of a generation of youngsters and threw middle-aged men on the scrapheap. Crime soared and pensioners were locked inside, petried of being burgled for the price of a quick fix. We saw state schools and NHS hospitals crumble, while the private ones flourished.  She led us into a land where self-interest was all, where money bought le chances and determined death chances, where ruthless bosses treated workers like cart horses and government split its citizens into two categories: Us and Them. Us were those who shared its mercenary vision. Them were the ones who despised that vision, or couldn’t buy into it. And they were cast adrt. If you were with her you were fine as the incomes of the top % rose by £billion. Against her  You were kicked to the floor and stamped on. In the first half of the s, my home city of Liverpool lost , manufacturing jobs as inward investment stagnated, the council’s funding was hammered and the city was left to go into “managed decline.” I remember signing-on there in  after she’d abolished the Greater London Council where I’d worked, and being asked by the woman in the dole office: “Is there any place that bitch hasn’t closed down ” My lost dad joined three of my uncles in a Yosser “Gizzajob” Hughes search for a decent pay day. Most were unsuccessful.  The story was the same in the pit, steel, ship and car building communities of the North East, Midlands, Wales and Scotland. Per capita income on Merseyside fell to £,, lower than depressed parts of Portugal and Greece. In the old mining lands of South Yorkshire, it was £,. The likes of Scousers and Tykes were people Thatcher chose not merely to beat, but to make an example of, for daring to make a stand. She showed her colours during the miners’ strike and after Hillsborough when she let her private army, South Yorkshire Police, smear the injured and dead.But some did well by her. She sucked up to despots like General Pinochet, propped up apartheid in South Africa, and loved Jimmy Savile. She had him round for Christmas dinner and knighted him.She urged us to Tell Sid we wanted to buy shares in our publicly owned ­industries. But she didn’t tell us those xutilities would soon make billions for her rich chums as they ripped off the British people. She was hailed a liberator of the working class for allowing people to buy their council houses.  Many of the minority who could afford it made a tidy profit. But the majority who couldn’t lost out badly. She so distrusted local councils she banned them from re-investing most of the sell-off cash into building new homes, causing a severe housing shortage and rents to rocket. It meant the losers, left paying rip-off rents in insecure tenancies, had subsidised the winners who’d got homes cheap. The same old Thatcherite story. The effects are being felt, mainly by the young, to this day. She liberated City bankers with a Big Bang, turning London into the speculator’s world capital. To bonus-splurging Loadsamoneys, satirised by Harry Enfield, she declared greed was good. To the jobless losers, that there was no such thing as society. Within a decade we had a banking system which spawned out-of-control Krug-supping spivs who crashed the economy in .  Ordinary families were left to be poorer today than a decade ago while the spivs carried on picking up their bonuses. Those bankers aren’t the only products of Thatcherism that haunt us today. A generation of young Tories grew up worshipping her free-market views and her Euroscepticism. David Cameron thrust Brexit on us to try to placate them, taking us back to Thatcher’s days as a warring nation. George Osborne brought in austerity to shrink the state and attack the poor taking us back to Victorian times. Look at her glorious Thatcherite legacy. We work longer hours in less secure jobs, there are hordes of homeless on the streets, kids go to school hungry, families live off foodbanks, the NHS is in crisis. Social mobility has stagnated as has productivity and investment. The North South ide is huge, the gap between rich and poor is off the scale. Some might say, it’s what she would have wanted. My feelings have never mellowed towards Thatcher and never will. Like millions of others I hated her and all she stood for because she showed through her actions that she hated us.  We gave her no respect because all she gave us was contempt. Four years after her first election victory, in June , Neil Kinnock warned the British people “not to fall ill...not to get old” under Thatcher. The first member of our family to get his words published in the Mirror died nine weeks after that speech due, partly, to an over-stretched NHS. Vic didn’t get old under her. Today, the second one gets to tell his big brother how spot-on he was about the right-wing fanatic who left everyone who didn’t buy into her ruthless dogma wringing their hands. Thanks for the warning, our kid.

He added: “We’re examining local, regional and national reports of missing people and while our initial physical searches of the area are now complete we cannot rule out the possibility of further searches being carried out as new evidence and lines of enquiry emerge. “I’d like to thank all those who have contacted us with information so far and would ask that anyone who believes they can assist our investigation to contact us.” Extensive searches of the area have been carried out after the body part was found on a path near the old railway track.

The  metre wide rock is scheduled to shoot across the sky , kilometres away from the Earth on Friday, April , , signicantly closer than the Moonaposs , km orbit. Named  Apophis, the large rock will first become visible to the naked eye in the night sky over the Southern Hemisphere, as it travels from the east coast to the west coast of Australia. It will then pass across the Indian Ocean moving west, flying over Africa and the Atlantic Ocean to reach sky above the USA in less than an hour.    On Tuesday NASA scientists discussed the research opportunities that would come from such a large asteroid flying so close to Earth at the  Planetary Defence Conference in Maryland. Apophis is about  times bigger than the typical asteroid spotted flying a similar distance from our planet. It will appear to shine as brightly as a star to those watching without a telescope.The Apophis close approach in  will be an incredible opportunity for science, Marina Brozović, a radar scientist at Nasaaposs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Calornia told Stuff.   Weaposll observe the asteroid with both optical and radar telescopes. With radar observations, we might be able to see surface details that are only a few metres in size. The asteroid was first spotted in  by a group of astronomers at the Kit Peak National Observatory. Back then they predicted it had a .% chance of hitting Earth.    In the years since that figure has been signicantly reduced to  in , chance. If an asteroid its size were to hit its impact could be devastating, with objects as small as m across having been known to damage environments and populations.

Amy White, of Rustington, West Sussex, was beaten up by Alexis Poupard, , in August . The -year-old, who is unable to work due to the PTSD from the attack, was left with a broken jaw and cheekbone, a fractured eye socket and loose front teeth after Poupard violently punched and kicked her in the head. The monster was jailed for nine years and three months after pleading guilty to attacking Amy and her two friends. Alexis had never been violent before, so it was such a shock when he attacked us, said Amy. It just shows you how you never really know someone.  We were so lucky to escape with our lives. Amy had met Poupardaposs now ex-partner, Laura Poupard, , in  at a barbecue and the two became close friends. By September , Laura, a stay-at-home mum, was pregnant and engaged to Poupard. Alexis was not the kind of man you messed with. He was huge with broad shoulders and bulging muscles, said Amy. I found him quite intimidating.  In May , Laura had her fourth baby and a few months later, in August, days before her wedding, she invited Amy and her kids round to her house. Amy said: It was a scorching day and we were looking forward to relaxing in the garden. But when Alexis ed home from work later that day, he began swearing and banging around in the kitchen.  Laura handed me her baby and went inside to find out what was wrong. I could hear Alexis shouting, then Laura fled outside telling me that he was angry that sheaposd not done the washing up. Amy and Laura cleaned the kitchen while Poupard went to the shop. The pair took the children back to Amyaposs house to avoid him.  By .pm that night, Laura had run out of baby milk and nappies. The shops were shut so they ed to Lauraaposs home to fetch some. Amy said: I offered to go into the house with her, along with our other friend. We had left the kids at home with my eldest. As our taxi driver pulled up outside Lauraaposs house, I asked her to wait for us.  But as we climbed out of the car, I spotted Alexis standing at the front door, looking furious. He marched over, asking where weaposd been. He flung himself at my friend. Without thinking I jumped in front of her and pushed her out of the way. Then, out of nowhere, Alexis punched me repeatedly in the head and I fell to the ground. My head pounded. The last thing I saw was Alexisapos shoe above my head before everything went black. When I came around, Laura was sobbing. I lay in a pool of blood, my cheeks were throbbing and I could barely open my eyes. I climbed to my feet and we rushed to the taxi driver, who had waited for us. The taxi driver had called the police.    She drove us back to my house, and officers and an ambulance arrived minutes later. At Chichester Hospital, doctors treated Amy for a split on her mouth palette, broken jaw and cheekbone, and a fractured right eye socket. Poupard had even knocked Amyaposs front teeth loose. She said: Laura had lost the hearing in her left ear and her lip was split after he punched her in the face. Meanwhile Alexis was arrested and remanded in custody. After three days in hospital, doctors removed part of my jaw and installed metal plates in a four-hour operation. For the next month, I could only eat liquidised food and had to give up my job as a carer. I suffered with anxiety and was diagnosed with PTSD.    I was devastated that Iaposd suffered such horric injuries. I felt lucky to be alive. In November , Poupard, of Rogate Road, Worthing, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, actual bodily harm and assault by beating at Lewes Crown Court. He was jailed for nine years and three months. Amy said: I was pleased he was locked up, where he canapost hurt anyone . Laura called off the wedding immediately and sheaposs raising her baby alone. Now weaposre closer than ever. Iaposm telling my story as a warning to others. Laura revealed: Seeing Amy get attacked was harrowing, I thought Alexis was going to kill her. Iaposve been left with hearing loss in my left ear and itaposs a constant reminder of what happened.

Tightly guarded, the inhabitants rabidly loyal, the sprawling campus of the controversial Chinese telecoms firm is so isolated that the only way in is by the company’s own tolled motorway. Around , work in the one-mile-square complex, many also living there and rarely leave the remote facility. Until this week, the name Huawei was mostly seen only in phone shops. But now it’s at the centre of a huge political storm over allegations sacked Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson leaked secret discussions about allowing it to take a leading role in UK telecoms. Critics say that while this would not be quite like letting the Communist Chinese into our front rooms, it would certainly allow them to eavesdrop on everything going on. Of course, Huawei’s -year-old founder Ren Zhengfei denies all this strenuously – and does it without stroking a Blofeld-style white cat.    This is probably the time to mention that not only is Zhengfei a former Red Army soldier, one of Huawei’s earliest contracts was to provide telecoms for the People’s Liberation Army. Zhou Daiqi, the company’s chief ethics and compliance officer, is also head of the Huawei branch of the Chinese Communist Party. And China is a country where, by law, a company cannot refuse to help the party spy on other nations.The UK political storm blew up after it emerged Huawei has reportedly won permission to help build our new G network – with PM Theresa May giving the go ahead despite warnings from her Home, Defence and Foreign Secretaries, and the UK’s closest allies.   But one British researcher who visited Huawei’ HQ in Shenzhen is “deeply troubled” at the prospect of the firm helping build our cyber network. He said: “I wasn’t allowed anywhere on my own and had a minder the whole time. “They were very cagey about me taking photos of certain places. It was similar to Chinese government buildings I’ve visited. Every desk had a party flag and Chinese flag. “Clearly, the party comes first. So in any situation needing a decision it will always be in the best interests of the party, not those of the clients. “I saw some tall African guys in traditional dress and asked who they were. “I was told they were from Sudan, Mali and Ethiopia buying new phone systems. At that time Sudan was under sanctions, its people under a very oppressive regime, yet Huawei were treating their leaders like VIPs.” The researcher said it was shocking the UK had decided to award the G contract.  He added: “I can’t believe what Theresa May is doing. From what I saw, signing a deal with China is basically signing the UK’s secrets away.” UK links with Huawei go back to  when BT signed a supply con­­tract. When the researcher visited the Chinese HQ, the BT logo was plain to see. But even BT confirmed last year it is removing Huawei equipment from key areas following concerns. Huawei – the name translates as “China is able” – has grown from nothing  years ago to an annual revenue of about £billion last year. That was when it became the second biggest seller of smartphones – flogging million worldwide, behind Samsung but ahead of Apple. It is already contracted to build  G networks around the world and owner Zhengfei is said to be the world’s rd richest man worth over £billion.  This unbelievable growth has caused many to speculate on whether Huawei is a front for the China’s plans to expand its world influence. With the country now the leading source of cyber attacks, analysts have warned Beijing may be using Huawei to spy on competitors and steal intellectual property. It could even, once in control of its systems, shut down a foreign power’s infrastructure. Last week the US warned involving Huawei in our G network risked giving China a “loaded gun”. When he meets Theresa May next Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will again warn of the threat. He recently warned the US would not be able to share intelligence with a country using Huawei systems.  In fact, three of the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing community – America, Australia and New Zealand – have banned Huawei from their G networks. Canada is reviewing its relationship. Each cites evidence the company may use its technology to sabotage or spy on their citizens and governments, including the discovery of “hidden backdoors” which could enable China to spy on people in their homes and workplaces. A senior security source said “It is highly worrying that the deal with Huawei could erode the Five Eyes alliance. “Despite assurances from the PM, it is asking an awful lot for people to separate the Chinese State and its intelligence agencies from a high profile com­­mun­­ications company with close links to both.” Last week it was reported Vodafone had found “hidden back doors” in Huawei equipment that “could have given unauthorised access to the fixed-line network in Italy”.  In January US prosecutors charged Huawei with stealing tech­­nology after an employee sneaked into a T-Mobile testing lab, put a robotic arm in his bag, and walked out. Last December founder Zhengfei’s daugh­­ter, the company’s finance chief, was arrested in Canada on suspicion of breaking US sanctions on Iran. She is now awaiting extradited to the US. In what was seen as an act of retaliation, China sentenced two Canadians to death on drugs charges. It is perhaps no wonder, then, that our security services have long warned the government of the huge risks of allowing Huawei to have anything to do with communications systems. Warnings which Theresa May has clearly failed to heed.

litter pick is carried out once a year, a number of items are often found.Murray added: “There must have been a real effort in putting the TV there.“We’re hoping next year we can expand it as Tesco is

investment, including £m of funding to unlock housing sites that are of strategic importance to the local authorities, as well as five-year certainty on £m of affordable housing grant.But at a meeting of the City Region Deal Joint Committee at Woodhill House yesterday, it was revealed that, to date, none of this has been allocated to develop new housing sites.Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire Councils have entered talks with the Scottish Government over getting local control to decide how the £m is spent.A report by Mel Booth, senior housing strategy officer, said: “Initial discussions with Scottish Government regarding this proposal have been favourable, and they have requested an outline proposal for consideration, with a further detailed proposal to be submitted after this pending agreement.“The local authorities are working together to identy further sites in the City Region that could use this funding.”Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said there were “strict criteria” from the Scottish Government on what sites the money could be used for.She added: “We wanted to try to enter into negotiations to try to make sure it could be spent on affordable housing.“It’s important we deliver on that in the region.”A formal submission is expected to be made to the Scottish Government by the end of June, with a final proposal submitted to the Joint Committee in August.Members of the committee were told that the formal submission will include sites and “full detail” on how the £m will be spent across the north-east by March .A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “We will continue to work with both Aberdeen City Council and Aberdeenshire Council to establish the most effective means of utilising the £m infrastructure funding aligned to the

invited to Aberdeen as part of the Spectra Festival two years ago.While visiting the city, he captured some of its most stunning landmarks, including the Kirk of St Nicholas, Torry Battery, Aberdeen Town House and Rubislaw Quarry as part of his Secret Cities project, which involves him documenting parts of cityscapes which may be hidden from the public’s view.Andrew has photographed cities such as New York, Shanghai, Reykjavik and Zaragozain the past. vw, px\"  The photographs he took on his trip to Aberdeen came to light when he was profiled in a blog by Visit Manchester about his work in his home city.Now he has explained the motivation behind his visit to the Granite City and hopes to give more people in the north-east the chance to view his work.Andrew said: “I was invited to come up to Aberdeen as part of the Spectra Festival in .“At the time, I didn’t share the pictures I had taken too widely and the Secret Cities project hasn’t had that much exposure.“I started the project in Manchester and I had already done some work in Edinburgh before I came up to Aberdeen. That had got me really interested in the Scottish cities and some of the architecture you can see around them.“Aberdeen really lends itself to that kind of exploring and the sort of photography I was looking to take for the project.“There are a lot of contrasting old and new spaces which were a lot of fun to capture. There are also a lot of really sacred places which make it really poignant.“I love going to new cities because I think when you are in your own home town, you sometimes miss a lot of things.“I really enjoy it when I can go and apply that same thought process, of making a real effort to access signicant places, to somewhere I’m not familiar with.” vw, px\"  Andrew’s initial plan for Secret Cities was to capture images which would sum up the identities of the cities he visited.He said: “When I was planning the trip, I knew I really wanted to get a shot of something which sums up the offshore industry as that’s the thing that really springs to mind when people think of Aberdeen. That’s why I initially focused on the area around the harbour.“Once I’d done that, I spent a fair bit of time getting to know some of the older buildings in the city and working out the best shots that would be possible.”Andrew said several of Aberdeen’s landmarks caught his eye on his trip to the city – with some taking him by surprise. vw, px\"  He said: “I was able to get under the Kirk of St Nicholas. It was built on the site of an old graveyard and it was really interesting to see some of the things that were underneath the church – including some human bones.“There were two places that I really wasn’t expecting to be as good as they were but turned out to be really interesting.“The first was the Masonic Temple. Getting inside there was absolutely fascinating and the people were very generous in terms of giving me access.“There was also Rubislaw Quarry which I really loved.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Ministers only remain in office for as long as they command the confidence of the PM. Having lost that confidence, he could no longer serve in that role.However, Labour insists neither Mrs May nor a senior civil servant should be the arbiter of whether or not there should be a police probe but, rather, it should be the police themselves.Last night, Tom Watson, the partyrsquos deputy leader, wrote to Mrs May, calling on her \"as a matter of urgency\" to pass the information gathered during the Whitehall inquiry onto the police \"so an appropriate investigation can take place\".Mr Watson said it was \"clear\" the unauthorised disclosure of secret NSC discussions on the involvement of Chinese tech giant Huawei in the UKs G phone network could amount to a breach of the Official Secrets Act.He told Mrs May: \"The lack of action from your Government to refer these matters to the police is putting the Commissioner of the politan Police in an impossible position.\"She will not be able to investigate without access to the information gathered by your internal inquiry. This information is held by the Cabinet Office.\"It is not for the ministers or civil servants in the Cabinet Office to determine whether the information they have gathered meets the threshold for a criminal investigation.

The former Secretary of State has declared: ldquoI swear on my childrenrsquos lives that Irsquom innocent.A string of senior Conservative MPs have also demanded a full investigation.One, Sir Desmond Swayne, the former minister, said Mr Williamson had effectively been branded a liar, telling MPs: \"Natural justice requires that the evidence is produced so that his reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed.\"David Lidington, Mrs Mayrsquos de facto deputy, was accused of being ldquocasual with the facts after he responded to an Urgent Question in the Commons on the Williamson case.He told MPs: \"The Prime Minister has said she now considers that this matter has been closed and the Cabinet Secretary does not consider it necessary to refer it to the police.\"But we would, of course, co-operate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary.\"Yet earlier, Cressida Dick, the Met Commissioner, made clear that the force could only investigate the matter of whether Mr Williamson had broken the Official Secrets Actit received a referral from the Cabinet Office, where Mr Lidington is the lead minister.She said any official secrets would be owned by the Government, which held any evidence relating to them.\"It is sitting in the Government. We as the police when considering whether there is an appropriate criminal investigation or not will have to be party to that material. At the present time we are not in possession,\" explained the Commissioner.Stewart McDonald for the SNP raised a Point of Order, suggesting Mr Lidington was fully aware that his office would not refer the matter to the police even though he had offered Scotland Yard the Governmentrsquos full co-operation with one.ldquoHe must have known when he was on his feet, responding to questions that that was the case, declared Mr McDonald. ldquoThey could not co-operate with a police investigation that the Government has no intention of asking the police to proceed with, he explained.Suggesting there was a ldquodegree of being casual with the facts, the Glasgow MP urged Mr Lidington toto the House to clary what the Governmentrsquos position was and ldquowhat its role might be in getting, what many in this place believe to be pivotal, the police to investigate the entire sorry affair.Meanwhile, the Williamson case was raised at Holyrood where, during FMQs, Nicola Sturgeon said it was ldquoreprehensible that there were leaks from the NSC and that it was a ldquosign of the complete dys at the heart of the UK Government.The First Minister added: ldquoAll politicians in Government should recognise the responsibility and the privileges we carry and should not be behaving in the way it Gavin Williamson appears was behaving for their own selfish political ends.\""},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-parliamo-outlander","story":"THE Herald reported that Prince Charles is to meet Outlanders Scottish star Sam Heughan on a visit to the Royal Conservatoire in Glasgow this week.

It would seem that all of us like women athletes to excel physically but many of us expect them to do it only within the traditional parameters of how women should look.The typical male spectator probably likes it this way because,a woman athlete looks like a woman, there can be no question over his sexuality, but women athletes also appear to go along with it. Some of them have spoken about the pressure before events to do their hair and make-up so they look good ndash i.e. feminine. Others have made disgusting and prejudiced comments about Caster in private, based on how she looks. In the end, all of it underlines a depressing message to women from both men and women: be strong but not too strong be a great female athlete but remember to look sexy too.None of this is a new problem ndash just ask Martina Navratilova or Fatima Whitbread ndash but it may reflect the fact that sport has never really been the greatest friend of equality. For a start, itrsquos predicated on the idea of winning or losing menrsquos sport is also based on a proterozoic set of rules about masculinity, rule number one being you must fancy women, which is why therersquos still no openly gay man playing professional football in the UK. And kids who donrsquot fit in are still being forced on to the pitch to fail. My memory of games at school is about feeling inadequate and fearful. Sport never made me feel equal ndash quite the opposite.Those who would defend sport and the ruling against Caster Semenya ndash like those who defend the attempts to exclude trans women from womenrsquos sport or women-only spaces ndash say their position is based on science. But the science is just not that clear.For a start, not everyone has either XX or XY chromosomes and is therefore either clearly biologically female or male. That means you can try all you like to draw a clear line between men and women ndash and the sporting authorities are trying to do it with Semenya ndash but the line can never be arbitrary because neither biological sex nor gender is binary.Read more: Caster Semenya loses legal fight with IAAFThe position on testosterone is just as complicated. The sporting authority in Semenyarsquos case, the IAAF, says the testosterone in her body gives her an unfair advantage but the link between testosterone and athletic performance is far from clear it is also unclear how it inter-relates with other factors ndash height for instance or something more nebulous like talent. And testosterone is an unreliable indication of male and female anyway ndash almost one in five men have lower than average testosterone and some  per cent of women have higher than usual levels.But still the sporting authorities, and some feminists, and almost everyone who designs toilets and changing rooms try to stick to the old ways. They say theyrsquore doing it to defend womenrsquos rights ndash the right to take part equally in sport or the right to enter a women-only area free of the risk of an attack by a biological man ndash but this seems to me to misunderstand both the concept of equality and risk. In fact, there is no such thing as equality in sport ndash some people cheat, some people train harder, some are physically stronger, and some, such as Caster Semenya, have a great natural gt. Forcing Semenya to take drugs to lower her testosterone is not going to change any of that - Semenya herself says all she wants to do is to run naturally, the way she was born.The perceived risk to women from trans women, like the perceived threat to women in sport from athletes such as Semenya, is also monstrously exaggerated. Therersquos an idea that some trans womenwill sneak into female-only spaces and attack women. But not only is the risk vanishingly small, itrsquos a risk ndashlike any other ndash that society should manage for the sake of human rights.To use another example, we all know that therersquos a risk to children from paedophiles and other criminals, but we donrsquot therefore seek to ban all adult contact with children instead, we accept that the risk exists and, for the sake of a greater good, seek to manage it ndash and the same rules should apply to trans women who may commit crimes. Some of you may say the two issues ndash trans women and intersex woman ndash are dferent, but no: itrsquos all part of the same attack on the rights, visibility and representation of gay, trans and intersex people in public le ndash the attack on dference.Sadly, given the result of the Semenya case and the angry virulence of the critics of the Scottish Governments pro-trans legislation, I have to say I think the debate appears to be going in the wrong direction ndash you might even say the enemies of dference are in ascendance. Thankfully, there are some more progressive voices ndash a few female athletes have supported Semenya and the recent open letter from women supporting the right of trans women to self-identy was extremely heartening.However, in the end, Irsquom worried that the prejudice against Semenya ndash prejudice dressed up as biological truth ndash will embolden others. They will say itrsquos about equality and protecting womenrsquos rights, but itrsquos really about something deeper and darker: a fear of women who do not fit the traditional ideals, a suspicion of dference, and an existential horror at the idea that humanity ndash no matter how hard the people in charge of sport try ndash doesnrsquot fit into two neat boxes."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-gers-figures-not-valid-in-the-currency-debate","story":"Prof MacDonald bases his analysis on the ldquomassive current account deficit of  per cent of GDP which represents pound billion based on the latest Scottish Government statistics. One assumes the figures refer to the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandstatistics for the period   which are based on Scotland being part of the UK and not as an independent country with vastly dferent priorities from the UK, such as HS, Trident and so on. It is widely recognised that many of the GERS figures are compiled by estimation , which is also acknowledged by the Fraser of Allander Institute. Furthermore, in a Herald article in December  it was stated ldquoGERS was conceived as a political, not as a statistical, exercise. We know this because the original correspondence from the then Secretary of State, Ian Lang, was leaked some years ago ndash he wanted it to undermine the other parties, saying this initiative could score against all of them.\"The current GERS figures are hardly an advertisement to remain part of the UK but it would be interestingan economist could produce GERS figures for an independent Scotland no longer part of the UK but using the same sort of estimates as GERS and of course the same crystal ball.Alan M Morris, Kirkhouse Road, Blanefield, Glasgow.NOT being a professor of Macroeconomics like Ronald MacDonald I am easily misled by figures taken from Government statistics, particularly those from disputed sources such as GERS.When Professor MacDonald refers to the UK current account deficit being four per cent while Scotlands runs at  per cent, what proportion of oil revenue does he apportion to Scotland in his calculation  Is it a  per cent share , or is it  per cent, which would be an independent Scotlands share John Jamieson, Craigie Road, Ayr.IT is always disappointing when a reply to a published letter misrepresents the original, but particularly when the replyrsquos author is a respected professor in onersquos alma mater .Professor MacDonald never actually challenges any of the points in my letter of May . First, that the value of the pound is in long-term decline. Secondly, that the UKrsquos chronic balance of payments deficit is chronic. Thirdly, that HMRCrsquos Regional Trade Statisticsshow the UKrsquos trade deficit with the rest of the world is disproportionately due to England. In that sense only Scotland had a surplus, though that does not include North Sea oil as RTS treats that as a UK export. Lastly, that continuing with the pound would mean further decline.If Scottish electors are to make an informed choice between a Scottish currency and the pound, then a full understanding is needed of both. However, Prof MacDonald writes only of the claimed chaos and disaster of a Scottish currency while the alternative reality of the pound is never mentioned, far less discussed. However, given its continuous decline, and chronic balance of payments deficit, that is hardly surprising.He insists the current deficit on trade could not be financed by foreign reserves from an independence settlement, so ldquothere would be a considerable excess demand for foreign exchange on currency markets, and as in any market, the price of foreign exchange would have to rise which, in turn, implies a sharp devaluation of any Scottish currency. Eventhis came about to a signicant degree, it is still at least similar to what I have shown for the pound. A loss of  per cent of value against the euro in  years is rather more than a fluctuation.He also points to the ldquoimplications [a ldquosharply depreciated Scottish pound] would have for mortgages, pensions and other financial assets and liabilities asthis never happened to the pound.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"playlist for life event at library","story":"As part of the Aberdeenshire Wellbeing Festival Kintore Library will host a coffee morning with the aim of promoting Playlist for Le.Playlist for Le is a charity that was founded by writer and broadcaster Sally Magnusson following the death of her mother, Mamie, who had dementia.Sally said: “My mother was always singing.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made.

So we are passionate about minimising our impact on the world around us. The steps we have taken to remove single-use plastics are very positive and we will keep looking for more opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint.”One Stop Waste Solutions, an Aberdeen-based recycling and waste services company, has seconded that NorthLink Ferries has already met the criteria for the  ban on general commercial waste sent to landfill.Craig Donoghue, managing director of the organisation added: “We have been working closely with NorthLink Ferries since , and in that time have seen a sustained effort to recycle and reduce waste.

It has previously been suggested that the artist suffered a stroke in the late stages of his career, which weakened the right side of his body.While biographical evidence and paintings of the artist appear to confirm he developed a condition ldquothat affected his ability to hold palettes and brushes to paint with his right hand, the researchers said a stroke was not a likely cause.Co-author Dr Davide Lazzeri, a specialist plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgeon at the Villa Salaria Clinic in Rome, said: ldquoRather than depicting the typical clenched hand seen in post-stroke muscular spasticity, the picture suggests an alternative diagnosis such as ulnar palsy, commonly known as claw hand.He suggested a syncope, or fainting episode, could have caused trauma to da Vincirsquos right upper arm.The ulnar nerve runs from the shoulder to the finger and manages intricate movements of the hand.ldquoThis may explain why he left numerous paintings incomplete, including the Mona Lisa, during the last five years of his career as a painter while he continued teaching and drawing, Dr Lazzeri said.The Mona Lisa was painted some time between  and , the year of da Vincirsquos death.copy -.

We committed to ensuring  per cent of the UK’s energy demand in electricity and heating comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by . And, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, we committed to the UK achieving net-zero carbon emissions by  at the latest.The international community supported that approach and it was vindicated this week when the Committee on Climate Change recommended the UK should seek to achieve net zero carbon emissions by , and by  in Scotland.There has been much optimism about the fact that a climate emergency was declared following Labour’s motion in the Commons this week. Yes, Nicola Sturgeon made a similar declaration at SNP conference the previous weekend, but look below the surface and there’s clearly a dference of opinion between us on what actually constitutes a climate emergency.Labour believes it presents opportunities to transform our economy for the benefit of everyone. That is why we are committed to a green industrial revolution and to a just transition from fossil fuels to renewables.When Nicola Sturgeon announced her climate emergency, she could have made real commitments now to ban fracking, for example, or reverse reckless plans to scrap Air Passenger Duty. But she didn’t.: Calls for Nicola Sturgeon to scrap air taxes to meet climate change targetShe could have ordered her MPs to oppose the Transferable Tax History scheme which means taxpayers are subsidising fossil fuel exploration. She didn’t.The Labour party is not alone in opposition. Organisations such as Global Witness, Friends of the Earth, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland and the Aviation Environment Federation have aired concerns about these policies. They’ve fallen on deaf ears so far but the SNP might yet see sense and change tack.There is a reason that the Committee on Climate Change has said Scotland can achieve net carbon emissions five years before the rest of the UK – because our natural resources provide us with the capacity to do so.Labour’s green industrial revolution plans are widely recognised by the industry and climate change campaigners as hugely ambitious.They’re certainly bold. Our programme of investment and transformation to achieve a  per cent reduction in emissions by  could create over , high-skilled, well-paid, unionised jobs in the UK, , of them in Scotland.: Climate change: If we fail to act, we already know what will happen – Joyce McMillanOnshore wind could mean , new jobs offshore wind another , jobs. In addition, our UK-wide home retro-fitting programme could result , more jobs. Our plan is ambitious but it is achievable – and essential.As the Committee on Climate Change highlighted,we are going to fulfil our duty and be world leaders in reducing carbon emissions then changes to the way we all live our lives will be necessary.In very stark terms, we are probably the last generation able to prevent run-away climate change. That is a huge responsibility. It will not be easy. It will require determination.And, it will require very strong political will.I believe we can - and must - succeed in tackling climate change. But we must also seize the opportunity to transform our society and our economy through a green industrial revolution.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why the snp does not speak for scotland pamela nash","story":"The priorities of SNP delegates gathering at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre for their party conference are at odds with the people of Scotland, writes Pamela Nash.AS senior SNP politicians deliver their conference speeches today, it is increasingly obvious that they are talking only to their party – not to the country.The same was true with Nicola Sturgeon’s statement to parliament earlier this week, when she set out her latest proposals for breaking up the UK.She didn’t talk about the crisis in education. Or the crisis in our hospitals. Or the crisis on our railways.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteFor the SNP, it is independence first, second and always.No matter how loud the applause in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre is this weekend, Nationalist politicians would do well to understand that their own priorities are at odds with the people of Scotland.: MSPs say concerns raised about changes to gender act are ‘misleading’We know this from the latest opinion polling published this week.Voters were asked to rank issues in order of which they thought should be the most important for the Scottish Government to prioritise.The NHS was ranked in the top three by  per cent of respondents, with the cost of living on  per cent, the economy on  per cent, and education on  per cent.Constitutional affairs and independence scored just nine per cent.I suspect you would get a very dferent resultyou surveyed SNP delegates at the EICC, which just shows how out of touch with reality the SNP has become.While they talk among themselves, the message from the public is clear: get on with the day job.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by The First Minister could start by fixing the mess her Government has made of our once-envied education system.It emerged this week that some schools are having to teach pupils studying for National , National  and Higher qualications in the same class.An obsession with the constitution means a generation of children is being let down by this Government.Amid this crisis, the idea that we should spend the next two years having yet another debate about independence is the height of irresponsibility.But that is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon wants to do. She wants to ide the country once again and hold an unwanted second independence referendum before .How do we know it’s unwanted  Because the people of Scotland have said so.Only one-in-five voters support the SNP’s reckless plan to hold another contest before the next Holyrood election.People remember the ision and the toxic atmosphere from  and they don’t want to go through that again any time soon.And they certainly don’t want to go through it while the country is still ided over Brexit.Whatever your views on Brexit, we can all agree that it has revealed just how dficult and complex it is to leave a political union.The UK has only been in the EU for four decades, and it is a much looser partnership of countries than the United Kingdom is.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘facing rebellion’ over post-independence currency plansJust imagine how dficult it would be to tear Scotland out of a centuries-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.It’s little wonder that so many people who voted ‘Yes’ in  have changed their minds. According to this week’s poll, a third would now vote to remain in the UK.Despite campaigning every day since September , the SNP has managed to turn more people off independence. Support for leaving the UK now stands at just  per cent.Most Scots know that we are stronger together and want to build a successful economic future based on our shared culture, history and institutions. Institutions such as our currency – the pound.Today, the SNP will vote to scrap the pound and adopt a new currency in an independent Scotland, putting salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk. According to the polling figures published today, that is supported by just  per cent of voters – while  per cent want to keep the pound.By remaining in the UK, we can keep our pound, grow our economy – without extra red tape for businesses – and use a stable currency backed by the strength of the UK’s central bank and its  million taxpayers.But, instead, today’s conference debate will focus on when to inflict economic harm on communities: immediately in the short-term or after a few years.And it will be coupled with the SNP’s growth commission blueprint which confirms breaking up the UK would lead to even deeper austerity.This isn’t the future most people want for Scotland. It’s not a choice we should have to make.We don’t want another independence referendum.We don’t want to create further ision and have a debate about whether to erect barriers between our friends, families and neighbours in the rest of the UK.But I know the SNP will never drop its narrow nationalist agenda. It will never stop campaigning for separation.So that is why those of us who believe in solidarity must continue to campaign as well. We speak for the majority of Scots who want a Government focused on building a better future for the people of Scotland as part of the UK.We must continue campaigning so that Nicola Sturgeon stops listening only to Nationalists and starts listening to the nation.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"politicians pledge to sort brexit after vote drubbing","story":"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have both recommitted to delivering Brexit after suffering the worst local election results in decades.The Conservatives shed more than , councillors, the deepest losses since , while Labour failed to capitalise and lost more than  wards in council elections across England.Both the main party leaders said voters had delivered a rebuke over the failure to agree a Brexit deal in a strong signal that cross-party talks could produce a compromise ahead of a deadline in the middle of next week.The Prime Minister was confronted with anger from her own party, with backbench MPs calling for her removal and warning the party would be “toast”it did not change direction.While giving a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference, a heckler interrupted Mrs May saying: “Why don’t you resign  We don’t want you.”Voters across the country vented frustrations over Brexit on both major parties. Conservatives lost control of  local authorities, with councils including Chelmsford, Winchester and Bath falling into the hands of the Lib Dems. Labour was also licking its wounds after forfeiting control in heartland councils like Burnley, Hartlepool and Bolsover.Mrs May told the Welsh Conservatives in Llangollen: “I think there was a simple message from yesterday’s elections to both us and the Labour Party – ‘just get on and deliver Brexit’.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: “So far, message from local elections – ‘Brexit – sort it’. Message received.”And responding to the early results, Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “We’ve got a clear message from a lot of these communities that the two main parties need to get on and get Brexit sorted.”Talks between Labour and the Conservatives on a Brexit compromise deal will reach their climax next week, with time set aside for votes in the Commons on a possible agreement.The government says the discussions must conclude by the middle of next weekEuropean elections on  May are to be avoided.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned it would be “unforgivable” for Jeremy Corbyn to “sign, seal and deliver a damaging Tory Brexit” with no option of a second EU referendum.In Sunderland, which voted to leave the EU by  per cent, Labour held on to the council, but lost  wards, with the Liberal Democrats, Greens, Ukip and Tories all making gains.

And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals.

How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##.

We were a support network for each other really.“I knew everything was going well for her le. Her partner Sara meant I never had to worry about Lyra. Everything was in place for her and it is really bad her le has been ended so quickly.”Conall was contacted after the vigil by Susan Curran, who came up with the idea of the walk.“The idea came about quite spontaneously the night after Lyra’s killing in a conversation I had with Conall,” she said.“Conall had organised the vigil but I was late in work that night and really gutted that I missed it. “The idea came in my head of a walk from Belfast to Derry. I just said to Conall let’s do it!“I was just overcome with anger about what happened and fear that we were going back to that.“We are just a group of people who want to react and take action. I have legs, a voice and a heart and that is all I need for the walk.“Everyone can take part in the walk in any way they can. We would ask people to challenge themselves. We are asking people to ‘Be more Lyra’.“Our message to people who don’t support us is for them to be honest with themselves and realise the majority of people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.“We don’t want any more young people in graves or swayed by violence. We want Lyra’s death to be the last Troubles-related death in our society.“Through the walk, we want to demonstrate the will of the majority of people in our society to reject violence as a means to resolving our issues.“We want to rejuvenate and bring new le into the principles of the Good Friday Agreement which has been broken time and time again. As ordinary people in society, we are fully behind it.“We have very real memories of the Troubles and we don’t want a repeat for our children and our children’s children.“We believe Lyra’s death will be a catalyst for change. This is our generation’s peace walk.”The walk will leave Writer’s Square in Belfast at am on Saturday, May  to walk the  miles to Moneymick in Randalstown for the first camp.On Sunday , walkers will depart at am to walk  miles to Dungiven for the second stop over before completing the last  miles on Mondayto Guildhall in Derry.Brenda Gough is encouraging people to get involved in whatever way they can.“Over  people have registered. People want to get involved in whatever way they can, evenit isn’t actually doing the walk.“We have Lyra’s partner, Sara’s blessing to start from Writer’s Square because Lyra was a writer of course.“At the campsites, we want people to talk to each other and facilitate the dficult conversations.“Everything is in motion when it comes to the logistics. People will be safe and comfortable from tents to shower facilities and providing tea and coffee. There are so many people who want to help out and we would appeal to everyone to get involved in whatever way they can, no matter how small.”To keep up to date with Lyra’s Walk, visit the Facebook page ‘Lyra’s Walk on th of May to th of May’ or email lyraswalk@gmail.You can also sign up for the walk at https:www.eventbrite.ie e lyras-walk-tickets-"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-10.56.54.png","title":"new leisure centres starting to take shape","story":"EXCITING new pictures of the progressing development of West Belfast’s two new leisure centres have been released this week.Sinn Féin representatives visited the sites of the new leisure centre’s in Andersonstown and Twinbrook.The new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is a £ million project with a focus on family fun.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive. I definitely think people will identy with the show.”Keep Telling Me Lies will be performed at The MAC theatre from Thursday May  until Sunday May .

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"alex best loses licence after drinkdrive collision","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Telling them theyve landed in the wrong place is not the message we should be putting out.\"Sinn Fein said that \"clearly Ian Paisley has a great deal of experience of tourism and overseas travel... but he obviously knows nothing about marketing\".\"Tourists from across the world see Ireland as a single entity and it is rightly marketed as such,\" it said.\"His comments also show a lack of understanding of the north-south bodies which his party colleagues sat on which have responsibility for all-Ireland tourism marketing.\"Hospitality NI chief Colin Neill said that something has to be done to ensure Northern Ireland maximises its tourist potential.However, he admitted Mr Paisleys words was \"not the sort of language I would have used\".\"The Republic of Ireland is our second biggest market behind Great Britain,\" he said.\"Around % of air traffic of visitors to Northern Ireland comes through Dublin Airport, so yes, we need to do everything we can to make sure they turn left as well as right after they arrive.\"But theres a bigger issue and that concerns infrastructure in Northern Ireland.\"We have to do more to attract international flights to Belfast airports. Ways of bringing visitors directly into Northern Ireland have to be addressed.\"He called for reductions in air passenger duty and the development of new routes as tourism here \"could be missing out on as much as £bn a year\".\"Its easier to keep people in Northern Irelandthey arrive at one of our airports in the first place,\" he said.Gerry Lennon from Visit Belfast and Odhran Dunne from Visit Derry appeared before MPs at yesterdays Westminster committee hearing. Both agreed that more marketing was essential, but warned that resources were tight and more public sector funding is needed.Tourism NI, the organisation which handles marketing in the Republic, said it was not in a position to comment as it would be contributing to the committee at a later date.Tourism Ireland is the body responsible for marketing overseas."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland catholic school population surges to record high","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thursdays poll will be the first elections for which registering online has been an option and has led to the surge in voter numbers. Electronic registration was rolled out here on June  last year, the aim being to make it even easier for people to register to vote. The process takes less than five minutes and involves filling out some personal details in a short online form. Paper registration forms are still available for those unable or unwilling to register to vote digitally, and can be ed to a local election office.Around % of applications to vote i have been made online since the new system was introduced last summer. Electronic registration has been available to voters in England, Scotland and Wales since .Five years ago at the last local elections, the eligible electorate was ,,.It has now risen to a figure of ,,.According to the Electoral Commission, overall across the UK more than half-a-million people have applied to register to vote in the upcoming local elections, % more than expected.In the run-up to this weeks poll the commission said , people applied to join the electoral register across England and Northern Ireland.

In January of this year , online and paper applications were received here, which rose to over , the following month. Over , further registrations were submitted between March  and April . Northern Irelands Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea says voter registrations have risen substantially in the past  months. \"We are certainly now looking at over % of people registering online to vote as they find it much easier and it only takes a couple of minutes,\" she said.\"We have indeed, as monitored by the Cabinet Office site, had unprecedented online applications to register - over , since the service began last June and more than , in advance of the local council elections. The new online system appears to be working well with very few complaints from people that they find it complicated, and the numbers availing of the service prove that.\" Ms McVea added that the names of some deceased persons may still be on the registerthe death occurred outside the jurisdiction. \"The General Registrars office and Coroners office provide the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland with details of deaths for removal,\" she said. \"This is only for deaths which occur within the jurisdiction. \"We do not receive the deaths data for deaths occurring in other countries and do rely on relatives to advise the office in those instances.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"party officials outnumber voters in slow day at polls in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Surely a reasonable time to find a steady stream of constituents at the polling stations  Polling stations are usually located in primary schools where, at that time, children would be playing, perhaps that old favourite, hide and seek.Read MoreSuzanne Breen: Five things to watch for when the votes are castInitial Northern Ireland election results expected at lunchtimeThere were no schoolchildren out yesterday, but, in their absence, voters in Belfast who should be there instead had certainly got the hang of hiding. Very quickly it turns into a game of spot the voter.At West Kirk Presbyterian Church on the Shankill Road, there are more election workers for the DUP and PUP than people walking past to cast their votes. \"Its quiet,\" one observes. \"Very slow\".In a -minute period between pm and .pm, only one lady strolls into the polling station.\"We have over  names on the register here. Weve had around  in so far. Thats it,\" Im told.There are, of course, expectations that the trade in the vote business will pick up later in the evening when the working day ends, but things havent got off to a promising start.Over to Cltonville Road, where the local primary school is closed for the day to serve as a polling station.Sinn Fein representatives are on the gate and again there are more of them than voters making their way along the laneway. For  minutes not one person walks past.Im about to give up when a lady finally ambles by.\"I vote every time,\" she says. \"I dont know how many people come out, but they should all be made to.\"I was brought up in a home where my mum and dad always voted. Its right to have a say.\"One or two more move past as we talk.\"Im here because the DUP say no to everything. I want to speak up for myself,\" one man tells me.For now hes a lone voice in the wilderness.As yet, theres no sign of the other main political parties. The UUP, the Alliance Party or the SDLP likely feel their resources are better deployed in other areas of the city.Maybe change is as possible, as some might say, but for now, on the streets of Belfast at least, its the politics of red, white and blue and green, white and gold that continue to dominate. Everyone  is still squeezed to the margins.At Edenbrooke Primary School off the Crumlin Road, which has a catchment electorate of over , voters for both the Oldpark and Court wards, you wouldnt say the flow was steady - to call it a trickle would be pushing it.\"I have the right to vote and I want to use it,\" says one man. \"I dont agree with much our politicians say, butI dont vote I cant complain.\"That says a lot. Voting so he has a right to complain.Its a sad indictment on our country that its got itself into such a sorry state that voters just dont seem to care.Perhapsour politicians were seen to do something meaningful, that spark of enthusiasm would reignite.In the meantime, the cure for election hangover is that old traditional hair-o-the-dog. A bit of the same to ease the pain - European Parliament elections are just around the corner, on Thursday, May .That may be more interesting to voters as the Brexit card comes back into play and some of our political big-hitters are on the canvass trail, but you suspect an overbearing sense of apathy will prevail again and the only excitement will be amongst our schoolchildren, who will be getting another day off lessons.The Electoral Office described voting yesterday as \"steady\". Turnout reports from polling stations at pm yesterday ranged from a low of % in east Belfast to as high as % in one venue in the north of the city. The final turnout in the last council elections, in , was just over %."},{"url":null,"title":"some opposition within dup over election of partys first gay candidate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities.

They came up with the idea to host a fundraising event within their school involving students wearing a bright jumper to school on Blue Monday, January .They raised pound which went to supporting early intervention strategies towards young people. As a result, these students appeared in a video which was created by Action for Children and was shown to MPs and MLAs at Stormont to raise awareness of mental health issues towards young people and the need for extra government funding.The runner-up in this category was Lara OrsquoNeill, Head Girl at St Maryrsquos High School in Newry.The Innovation and Creativity Award category was won by the Slurrysafe team of Conal Murray, Matthew Isaac and Connor Kelly, from South Eastern Regional College in Downpatrick.The boys, all from farming backgrounds met at an engineering course and decided to tackle the risks associated from slurry by designing a slurry alarm after an incident affected one of their families.Their design dfers by linking the alarm to the tractor engine so that when the alarm sounds, power to the tractor is cut off which stops the slurry mixer. This alerts the farmer and a sensor sends a message to a mobile phone of the risk.The runners-up in this category were Assumption Community Link mdash students at Assumption Grammar School who have been innovative in establishing a community link with local primary schools in the Ballynahinch area.They have supported children in the local area who have high levels of illiteracy and innumeracy and struggle with socio-economic hardship.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy. The fact this has not happened is deeply disappointing, Cllr Curran continued.The local politician said the temporary one-way system is impacting on traffic volumes in St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street in particular, with some shoppers opting to avoid Downpatrick as work on the public realm scheme continues.Cllr Curran also suggested that the delay in delivering the public realm scheme would ldquosimply not be tolerated in any other area. He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

The message must go out that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.Cllr Andrews said many people worked hard to persuade the local council to redevelop the Westlands play park and are bitterly disappointed that their commitment and dedication to the local community is not shared by others.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoshocked to learn that play equipment had been damaged describing those responsible as ldquothoughtless vandals.He continued: ldquoAll councillors worked hard to deliver this upgraded play park for the community and to see it so needlessly damaged in the first week it has been open is so disappointing and adds to the ongoing anti-social behaviour problem in Crossgar.Cllr Brown said he met with Mr Teggart at the play park to inspect the damage and discuss how the local authority and PSNI can stop such ldquoreckless behaviour in the future.He added: ldquoThis sort of action cannot continue and those responsible will be held accountable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Voters take to the polls  ","story":"VOTERS go to the polls across the district tomorrow to elect  councillors to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Seventy one candidates are contesting the seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob, Mournes, Crotlieve, Slieve Gullion and Newry areas.With the final day of canvassing already underway and candidates targeting any remaining undecided voters, all eyes will be on the magical turnout number which could decide success or failure for some.Turnout in the  council election was just over % which saw almost , people visiting polling stations across the district.As the local council prepares for its second four year term, Sinn Fein and the SDLP will be battling to become the largest party and it is certainly all to play for.Both parties currently have  councillors with Sinn Fein sources quietly confident that the party will have increased its number of seats once the final result has been declared.What is clear is that the final outcome of tomorrowrsquos election is the toughest to call in decades given the number of interesting battles taking place right across the district.Locally, all eyes will be on Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and The Mournes which are intriguing to say the least, with the outcome potentially resulting in a dramatic change in the political landscape and some high profile figures losing out.In Downpatrick, attention will centre on the battle between Sinn Fein and the SDLP for electoral supremacy in an area where five seats are available.The SDLPrsquos Dermot Curran, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor are out to retain their seats, with Sinn Fein aiming to ensure that Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden will secure seats on the local authority for the first time.However, Independent councillor Cadogan Enright firmly intends to retain his seat, with strong support from a number of leading community groups in Downpatrick and Lecale.Add Aontuacute , the Green Party , Alliance , the DUPand UUPinto the mix and the expected dog fight for the fth seat could well be decided by transfers.In Rowallane, Independent candidate Martyn Todd and Sinn Feinrsquos Marianne Cleary will try to upset the current status quo in an area where the five seats are shared between the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance.Sinn Fein has never held a seat in Rowallane before, but clinching one in a traditional unionist stronghold would represent a seismic sht.The SDLPrsquos Terry Andrews topped the Rowallane poll in , but was only  votes ahead of the UUPrsquos Robert Burgess, who is confident his running mate, Walter Lyons, who polled  first preference votes five years ago, can join him in the debating chamber.Lyons is the only Ballynahinch-based candidate contesting the poll, with DUP sources confident that Billy Walker and Harry Harvey will retain their seats. But with no TUV candidate, what will the  voters who backed Philip Hamilton in  do this time around Independent candidate Todd is expected to eat into sitting Alliance councillorrsquos Patrick Brownrsquos vote, with the Green Party intent on making an impression through Emma Cairns. Aontuacutersquos Liam Mulhern is contesting his first election and with  candidates chasing five seats the election count will be a particularly nervous affair.In Slieve Croob, the SDLP is keen to grab two of the five seats up for grabs with current encumbent Mark Murnin, the local councilrsquos current chairman, joined by party stalwart Hugh Gallagher.Sinn Fein has made its intention clear by fielding three candidates. Republicans currently hold two seats through Roacuteisiacuten Howell and John Rice and are aiming to ensure through the partyrsquos tried and trusted vote management system that Drumaness woman Cathy Mason will also secure a seat.Sitting DUP councillor Garth Craig is not seeking re-election with the party selecting Maynard Hanna to defend his seat, while Alan Lewis is flying the flag for the Ulster Unionists.Alliance currently hold a seat in Slieve Croob through Andy McMurray but he surprised many byopting to stand in the Mournes area, with his position being contested by university graduate Gregory Bain from Clough.The Mournes is another intriguing battleground where former South Down Ulster Unionist MLA Harold McKee is bidding to make ato local politics and the SDLP is aiming toits sitting councillors, Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn.However, Sinn Fein has an eye on one of the SDLP seats and is fielding three candidates, sitting councillors Willie Clarke and Sean Doran alongside Leanne McEvoy.Henry Reilly topped the poll in  while standing on a UKIP ticket. Now an Independent Unionist, he looks set to retain his seat alongside DUP stalwart Glyn Hanna, with all eyes on Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray following his switch from Slieve Croob..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Zak tops Wicklow qualifiers  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Zak Hanna has been selected to represent Ireland in the upcoming European Mountain Running Championships which take place in the scenic Swiss town of Zermatt, at the foot of the world famous Matterhorn Mountain.Living on the slopes of Slieve Croob outside Dromara, Zak travelled down to Wicklow on Saturday to compete in the trial race which would select the team to travel to Switzerland.With this yearrsquos race an uphill only race, compared to last yearrsquos championship being an lsquoup and downrsquo race, runners competing in the trial started at Crone Woods car park on the edge of the Wicklow Mountains and climb along the Wicklow Way trails before entering the open mountain and begin the long and steep ascent to the summit of Djouce Mountain at  mabove sea level-similar to running from Newcastle to the top of Slieve Commedagh.Zak summited Djouce in first place with a good gap over the second-placed runner to add another Irish cap to his list..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17583092.council-election-2019-fermanagh-erne-north/resources/images/9806483.jpg","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".
