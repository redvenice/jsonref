Volunteers can pledge to pick up litter inidually, or join or host their own group.          The Duke of Cambridge has backed the Daily Mail’s campaign to clean up Britain, saying litter is not just an eyesore but ‘a threat to the health of our environment’William, a father of three, also advised that getting out in the fresh air to take part in a clean-up can be great for family bonding and a wonderful way to teach children how important the environment is to everyone.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ‘The duke encourages everyone who can to take part in the Great British Spring Clean.‘Litter is more than just an eyesore – it is a threat to the health of our environment.‘Litter pick-ups are great things to do as a family and can help teach children about how they can care for the natural world.’An aide said the duke was supportive of any attempt to clear up the litter that blights our towns and countryside.                                                                                        To sign up to the campaign, visit gbspringclean                                                     ‘Not only is it an issue of cleaning up the place in which we live but one that has wider environmental impact,’ they said.‘Anything that families can do to educate children about picking up litter and the issue this plays in the wider environment is a good thing.’ As father to Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and one-year-old Prince Louis, William, 36, has as much invested in the success of the scheme as anyone.He recently wrote in Country Life magazine of how he wants to follow in his father’s footsteps by sharing Prince Charles’s love for green issues with his own offspring.‘His passion for the environment and the natural world is something I want to repeat in the way I raise George, Charlotte and Louis,’ William said.He and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, have credited their father with stoking their own passion for picking up litter at an early age.In a television interview in honour of Charles’s 70th birthday in November, the two princes spoke affectionately about their father, highlighting how he was ahead of his time in making speeches about the perils of plastic on the environment.          As father to Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and one-year-old Prince Louis, William, 36, has as much invested in the success of the scheme as anyoneWilliam said: ‘He took us litter picking when we were younger, on holiday.‘We were in Norfolk on school holidays and we went out litter picking with him. We thought this is perfectly normal, everyone must do it. We were there with our spikes stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags.’The passion for litter picking clearly runs in the family. Only last week the Duchess of Cornwall called for action to combat the ‘shaming’ levels of litter in the nation’s streets and countryside.Camilla, who has been on several litter picking drives herself, said on a visit to Tower Hamlets in East London that pressure needed to be put on companies such as McDonald’s to encourage their customers to dispose of their rubbish properly, possibly even through fines.Yesterday Prime Minister Theresa May lent her support to the Daily Mail and Keep Britain Tidy campaign and said she would get involved in the Great British Spring Clean.The campaign has been endorsed by a host of celebrities and campaigners including TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who Prince William interviewed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Im called Archie Playful Prince George reveals nickname stunned dogwalker","story":"    Prince George told a woman walking her dog in Berkshire that his nickname is \u0027Archie\u0027.

Cooperators who spent time with him during his heyday said he often spoke about wanting to see either a movie or book made about his life story.  The Post described Edda as diligently taking notes during the testimony of Guzman\u0027s former bodyguard Isaias Valdez Rios.Seeking to get a better look at \u0027El Chapo,\u0027 Edda at one point even borrowed a pair of binoculars from a reporter. He also kept an eye on the kingpin\u0027s wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 29, who showed up in court dressed in an all-black ensemble.During a break in the proceedings, Edda got to meet the former beauty queen.The two were seen exchanging a kiss on the cheek and greeting one another in Spanish in the hallway.          Edda is seen throwing a Molotov cocktail while playing a young El Chapo in Narcos: MexicoGuzman\u0027s defense team joined Coronel and Edda and discussed the prospect of making a movie about the defendant\u0027s life in the future.One of the drug lord\u0027s attorneys, Eduardo Balarezo, quipped that he would like Academy Award winner George Clooney to portray him on the big screen. In recent years, Guzman has courted publicity, seeking to make a movie about his life and giving an interview to actor Sean Penn for Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. Speaking later to a gaggle of reporters outside Brooklyn Federal Court, Edda appeared starstruck by his encounter with El Chapo, saying his hands were sweaty and his heart was \u0027pumping fast,\u0027 according to the New York Daily News. He said it was strange for him to come face to face with the real El Chapo and that he never experienced anything like this trial.  Last week, a former Guzman assistant testified that he witnessed the defendant viciously torture his enemies before they were killed. He was one of the government\u0027s final witnesses.Federal prosecutors rested their case today, after three months of testimony by more than 50 witnesses. Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman\u0027s lawyers, said in his opening argument in November that his client was framed by the cartel\u0027s true leader, Ismael \u0027El Mayo\u0027 Zambada, with the help of corrupt government officials.Lichtman said on Monday he planned to call two U.S. law enforcement agents, whom he did not name, as defense witnesses on Tuesday morning. Lichtman had said in a court filing on Saturday that he wanted to call the agents to rebut testimony by two of the prosecution\u0027s witnesses about their earlier statements to law enforcement.Judge Cogan said prosecutors should expect to begin their closing argument on Wednesday morning.  Edda got a chance to meet Coronel outside the courtroom and exchanged a kiss on the cheek with her           Edda told reporters his hands were sweaty and his heart was beating fast during his encounter with El Chapo Guzman announced his decision after prosecutors rested their case against him in federal court in Brooklyn. After excusing the jury, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan asked Guzman directly whether he understood it was his decision, not that of his lawyers, to testify or not.\u0027Yes, but they counseled me about it and I agree with them,\u0027 Guzman answered.Had Guzman, 61, testified, it would have provided a fitting climax to an already dramatic trial. However, Guzman\u0027s decision was widely expected, as testifying would have exposed him to cross-examination by prosecutors.Guzman, the alleged leader of Mexico\u0027s Sinaloa Cartel, was extradited to the United States in 2017. He has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking vast quantities of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs into the country. The main defense argument, as put forth by Guzman lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman in his opening statement, has been that the real leader of the Sinaloa Cartel is Ismael \u0027El Mayo\u0027 Zambada, and that Zambada bribed the Mexican and US governments to frame Guzman.Guzman\u0027s lawyers have discussed multiple potential witnesses with prosecutors in open court, and have filed a motion suggesting they might call an inmate in the US prison system, but they have not publicly revealed any names. The defense was expected to call two witnesses Tuesday.

Volunteers can pledge to pick up litter inidually, or join or host their own group.          The Duke of Cambridge has backed the Daily Mail’s campaign to clean up Britain, saying litter is not just an eyesore but ‘a threat to the health of our environment’William, a father of three, also advised that getting out in the fresh air to take part in a clean-up can be great for family bonding and a wonderful way to teach children how important the environment is to everyone.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ‘The duke encourages everyone who can to take part in the Great British Spring Clean.‘Litter is more than just an eyesore – it is a threat to the health of our environment.‘Litter pick-ups are great things to do as a family and can help teach children about how they can care for the natural world.’An aide said the duke was supportive of any attempt to clear up the litter that blights our towns and countryside.

As father to Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and one-year-old Prince Louis, William, 36, has as much invested in the success of the scheme as anyoneWilliam said: ‘He took us litter picking when we were younger, on holiday.‘We were in Norfolk on school holidays and we went out litter picking with him. We thought this is perfectly normal, everyone must do it. We were there with our spikes stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags.’The passion for litter picking clearly runs in the family. Only last week the Duchess of Cornwall called for action to combat the ‘shaming’ levels of litter in the nation’s streets and countryside.Camilla, who has been on several litter picking drives herself, said on a visit to Tower Hamlets in East London that pressure needed to be put on companies such as McDonald’s to encourage their customers to dispose of their rubbish properly, possibly even through fines.Yesterday Prime Minister Theresa May lent her support to the Daily Mail and Keep Britain Tidy campaign and said she would get involved in the Great British Spring Clean.The campaign has been endorsed by a host of celebrities and campaigners including TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who Prince William interviewed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Generation web addicts Children spend time YouTube friends","story":"    The major Ofcom study comes as analysis shows iPads can stunt children\u0027s development          Nearly 20 per cent of under-fives have a tablet , rising to half of older children (stock image)Campaigners described the report from media watchdog Ofcom as frightening.‘In the early years, children need interaction with other people, and play – it is key to their social skills,’ said Sue Palmer of the group Toxic Childhood. ‘If that doesn’t happen when they are small, I don’t know where it leads.

It’s no substitute for a statutory lock requiring the Government to seek an extension of Article 50.’ The prospects for the amendment now hang on whether Labour decides to whip its MPs to support it.Supporters of the move believe they have the private support of the shadow cabinet.But a Labour source said a final decision would only be taken today, adding: ‘We are looking seriously at mechanisms to prevent no-deal but no final decision has been taken on specific amendments.’ The Cooper amendment would upend centuries of convention by putting MPs, rather than the Government in charge of Parliamentary business.

Jacaranda founder Valerie Brandes described the list as “a fine mix of established, recognised names and brand new voices delivering brilliant fiction, non-fiction and poetry”.“The importance of this from a publishing perspective cannot be overstated,” said Brandes. “The commitment to publish 20 black British writers in one year, in terms of sheer visibility for black writing and writers, is unsurpassed in this industry.”Jacaranda’s campaign, #Twentyin2020, is being run in collaboration with writers’ development group Words of Colour. Joy Francis, executive director at Words of Colour, called the current moment “an exciting time for independent publishing and black British writers who, for too long, have been under-celebrated and under-promoted”.The move comes as the UK publishing industry faces the reality of its white monoculture: after the introduction of several ersity initiatives across the big publishing houses in the wake of a scathing report into the industry’s lack of racial ersity among both writers and employees, recent research found that little has changed, with publishers still failing to reflect the UK’s racial and regional ersity.Jacaranda editorial manager Magdalene Abraha said: “As a young, black millennial who is a Londoner, I know that mainstream publishing does not quite represent the society I live in. The industry has a long way to go before it is truly representative … The #Twentyin2020 initiative will spearhead this much needed push. If a small, independent publisher like Jacaranda can publish 20 black British writers in one year, then there is no reason why larger publishers cannot match that.”Jacaranda’s move comes soon after the independent publisher Knights Of’s successful crowdfunding campaign to open pop-up children’s bookshops around the UK that stock only erse books, with the publisher raising almost £50,000.“We are in a time where people are rallying behind erse initiatives … these donations show that people are eager and supportive of publishing to become more erse,” said Abraha. “We hope that this will encourage unity and partnerships within the industry in favour of erse writers and books.”FictionDeadly Sacrifice by Stella AhmaduOf Mice and Men (working title) by DD ArmstrongBad Love by Maame BlueHow to Make Sticky Finger Soup by Emmanuella DekonorIf I Don’t Have You by Sareeta DomingoThe Street Hawkers Apprentice by Kabir Kareem-BelloLove Again by Rasheda Ashanti MalcolmUnder Solomon Skies by Berni Sorga-MillwoodBlack Star by Stephen ThompsonLote by Shola von RheinholdNon-fictionThrough the Leopards Gaze by Njambi McGrathThe Space Between Black and White by Esuantsiwa Jane GoldsmithA Circle of Five by Harris JoshuaAre We Home Yet? by Kate MasseyBlack History Walks by Tony WarnerPoetryLocating Strong Woman by Tolu AgbelusiJamakspeare by Brenda GarrickThe First Collection by Sarah Lipton-SidibehUntitled by Hibaq OsmanOn Reflection by Adjoa Wiredu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fcbedbcffdd00f07d144c11f0605379a35e79c/0_105_750_450/master/750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d3e28315f1d070ea3095ebc46528f6","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Jonathan Rendall’s This Bloody Mary Is The Last Thing I Own: A Journey To The End Of Boxing is, according to EstelleMoon, “one of the all time book titles”. It is also:A fantastic account of the author’s life in the boxing world, primarily as a journalist and writer but also as a manager for Colin “Sweet C” Macmillan in the early 90s. It takes us from Rendall’s childhood, fervently watching boxing on the TV and buying Ring magazine, to working for that same magazine staying in grubby Las Vegas hotels tracking down long-lost fighters in Cuba seeking out young upcoming talent, dealing with violence both in and out of the ring ... and ends with his eventual disillusionment with the whole game, and some hard-won realisations about life. It’s a brilliant book, written with real verve, and shot through with sadness, nostalgia and faded glory.The Warden by Anthony Trollope has been “much enjoyed” by vermontlogger:Quite apart from the inherent satisfaction of a story about a good man acting in accordance with his conscience – against the advice of all rational men! – there is Trollope’s comical satirising of secondary figures, which I had quite forgotten. We have, among others, Dr Pessimist Anticant, the Scottish thinker whose charm lasts only so long as he chooses to remain “vague, mysterious, and cloudy”, and Mr Popular Sentiment, the novelist whose “good poor people are so very good” and “hard rich people so very hard”, and Sir Abraham Haphazard, Attorney-General, with his bill to institute the bodily searching of nuns for Jesuitical symbols.A “pleasant surprise” for tiojo, in the form of Anthony Quinn’s The Rescue Man:A novel conjured from the little that is known of the life of a nineteenth century Liverpool architect. Peter Ellis’s most outstanding work is Oriel Chambers on Water Street in Liverpool. Described by Pevsner as “one of the most remarkable buildings of its date in Europe”.The author fictionalises him as ‘Peter Eames’ and sets the story a century later during the Blitz with the main character an architectural historian. Novels that have a real geographical setting but into which are inserted imaginary places are fascinating. As the story unfolds and locations are described you can picture exactly where the characters are standing. Then they turn a corner and enter an unknown street and an unknown building. You pause for an instant, wonder where you are, put your faith in the author and sit back and enjoy the story. For anyone who knows Liverpool this book is a treat. For those who like a tale of a doomed love affair it’s an equal pleasure.Rotwatcher was given CJ Sansom’s Dominion and is “loving every minute”:It’s an alternative history novel - Britain surrenders after Dunkirk and Churchill goes into hiding as leader of the Resistance. The book is set mainly in smog-bound 1950’s London, and Sansom effortlessly conjures up the privation, fear and horror of living under a regime that is mostly controlled from Berlin. It has rather worrying echoes of where the world is currently headed, with demagogues like Trump, Bolsonaro and others rising like turds in a midden. The style and pace remind me of two of my favourite thriller writers - Roberts Goddard and Harris.Jill Lepore’s The Secret History of Wonder Woman has impressed Veufveuve:I am greatly enjoying this meticulously researched history of the creation of Wonder Woman and her creator, psychologist Dr William Moulton Marston: a man, who despite his oddities (for many years he lived in a ménage-à-trois with his wife and Margaret Sanger’s niece), was deeply immersed in the American suffrage and feminist movements of the early 20th-century and genuinely saw Wonder Woman as a vehicle for a feminist message. Full of fascinating and unexpected detail, it is, as I said, deeply researched and, though I sometimes find Lepore’s writing a little “choppy” and abrupt, a vivid read that pulls the reader along“Righto”, says Appears78, “Murakami. Kafka on the Shore”:First read it back in my late 20s. It was lent to me my an Aussie friend just after I’d moved to Istanbul. It was a good time in my life. I remember liking it. The novel and life.Didn’t like anything else I’ve read of his since very much, so wasn’t sure how going back to it would be. And it was enjoyable - a guilty pleasure for the most part. Granted, sometimes his style reads a little like Enid Blyton with sexy bits, but there were various parts of it that were fairly compelling. You know - pageturnery. It was all a touch redolent of faux-intellectualism with its scattergun intertextuality and self-conscious exploration of the boundaries and ambivalences between dream and reality, symbols and tangibles, and space and time, but again, I found myself not really caring all that much…There’s plenty more to say, but I’ll try and keep it brief.

The company suffered “business integration challenges” in Norway in particular, he said.The weaker international performance prompted Domino’s to guide that its full-year underlying profit before tax will be at the lower end of analysts’ expectations of between £93.9m and £98.2m. The company also said that investment in central functions would dent short-term profitability.Domino’s, originally an American brand, opened its first UK outlet in 1985, before the British and Irish franchise was bought out in 1993.The company sold almost 90m pizzas last year in the UK, but its addition of 59 stores during the year to the more than 1,200 it already ran was significantly below its plans at the start of the year. Domino’s on Tuesday reaffirmed its long-term target of 1,600 stores in the UK, but did not give guidance on how many it expects to add in the coming year.Competition is increasing rapidly in food delivery, with Domino’s facing pressure from companies such as Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats, all of which enable rival pizza restaurants to offer home delivery.

Ten pairs of eyes flit between our backpacks and our faces. Is it worth mugging us? Do our bags contain bananas or useless, inedible wallets and cameras? The monkeys of Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang district decide against it and head further down the road in the hunt for victims. The morning joggers here run with sticks.“Twenty years ago this was jungle,” says Viswa Hattan, an accountant jogging in the area. Gated high-rises loom ahead of us, the roads leading to them flanked by forest too dense to enter without machetes. Four macaques, babies clinging to their chests, loiter on a metal road barrier uphill from a construction site. “This was their area,” says Hattan as a nearby male macaque begins vigorously masturbating. “We’ve taken it from them.”By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.The Malaysian capital’s dramatic urban expansion over the past 30 years has shunted much wildlife, including elephants and tigers, from its boundaries. The long-tailed macaques, though, have stayed, with the city’s growing human population providing them with a tempting source of thrown-away food.In 1980 the (human) population of Kuala Lumpur was less than 1 million it is now estimated at 7.6 million, and United Nations projections suggest it will surpass 10 million by 2032. While some of that growth has been in the central city zone, in massive structures such as the 90s-built Petronas Towers, the most rampant expansion has been at the outskirts of the city and in the surrounding lush forest.At suburban campuses such as that of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), complaints of messy monkey bin raids are rife. “They chase lecturers to the toilets,” says Prof Siti Aminah Osman, a deputy dean, as she stifles a laugh. In 2015 students mixed shrimp paste, spicy chilli and peanuts to feed the monkeys, to repel them. Now staff are working on “anti-monkey bins” with heavy lids.In KL Forest Eco Park, a slab of city-centre rainforest protected as a reserve since 1906, the macaque population is celebrated via cartoons on information boards. At Batu Caves, a popular Hindu temple site in north Kuala Lumpur, monkeys probably attract more tourists than the site’s enormous gold-painted statues. The caves back on to jungle, and the macaques crowd the area’s garishly painted staircase, swiping bags and creating top content for vloggers.Sethu Pathy, Batu Caves’ secretary, says the monkeys here rely on tourists for food, seemingly abandoning jungle foraging for a diet of chewing gum, stolen flower necklaces and hurled fruit. He supports his claim by lobbing bananas on the ground, causing a monkey melee before a macaque tips over a full cup of coffee left on a table. On the stairs, a monkey scoops its hand into a splatter pool of brown human vomit, then licks it clean.“Now we can’t see elephants or tigers in this district,” says Pathy, as the banana supply ends and the monkeys move off to explore nearby wheelie bins. “Day by day, land is being cleared for housing and factories. Natural habitats have been disposed of, but monkeys are still around. We occupied their habitat.”It is not all happy monkey families in the caves. Pathy says locals complain about the macaques stealing from them, and that eight years ago the Malaysian government’s wildlife department relocated many monkeys from the site to the forest.Around that time the department, reacting to complaints from the public about macaques across the peninsula, got tough. More than 57,000 long-tailed macaques were culled in Malaysia in 2010 – double the number from the year before. The figure rose above 97,000 in 2012, prompting a backlash from animal rights groups who claimed monkeys were sometimes shot out of trees, or captured in cages before being shot.With an average of 3,800 complaints from the public about long-tailed macaques made nationwide every year, the wildlife department’s culls have continued, with up to 70,000 of the animals killed annually between 2013 and 2016. The department declined to speak to the  but Ahmad Ismail, a biology professor at Universiti Putra Malaysia and president of the Malaysian Nature Society, says culling has been reduced over the past couple of years.Animal rights groups such as Sahabat Alam Malaysia have called for monkeys to be sterilised rather than culled, but although the wildlife department has experimented with castrating macaques, mass sterilisation would be very expensive. Ismail believes that focusing efforts on educating humans about interacting with monkeys is the most realistic way of reducing conflict between the species.Organisations including the Malaysia Nature Society already organise talks in schools about behaving around monkeys. Prof Badrul Munir of the UKM’s School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences says that if enough people refrain from feeding macaques where they congregate, the snack association eventually fades and they harass humans less.Whether monkey handouts decline or not, with Kuala Lumpur’s population due to surpass 10 million within 15 years, its human and its monkey residents look likely to have to share more and more living space. Many people in Malaysia are hoping for a future in which slightly fewer monkeys chase lecturers into toilet blocks, harass joggers and steal confidential military documents from postmen.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813177c33e23aa9be4aa864e34180df4efeb4529/0_344_6688_4014/master/6688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef318e6ce885e7b1cb4fda4e6943c66a","title":"mosques quebec security openness houston canada","story":"The planned transformation of Quebec’s Grand Mosque is haunted by the deadly attack on the Islamic centre in 2017Until 29 January 2017, random motorists on the busy Chemin Sainte-Foy would sometimes pull over to the Quebec City Grand Mosque to withdraw some money.Converted from a Desjardins Bank, it still looks like one, with its rows of rectangular glass panes and a barricaded drive-through. Its only crescent and minaret are in graphic form on a small plastic sign, blocked from the road by trees.Its ordinariness must have surprised those who had only heard about the mosque on radio-poubelles, or “trash radio”, Quebec’s uniquely corrosive brand of conservative talk radio. Even after a rightwing radical, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonette, opened fire on men and children inside – killing six, injuring 19 and traumatizing many of its 500 weekly worshippers – radio hosts continued vilifying the mosque, falsely claiming women were forced to enter it from between dumpsters “like cattle”.For a place burdened with so much tragedy, the mosque remains remarkably nondescript. Its plainness is further exaggerated by a French colonial cathedral directly across the street. Itself a beleaguered place of worship, several fires since the 18th century have reduced the historic site to an ornate stone facade.But soon, the cathedral could have a twin. Pending city government approval, the Grand Mosque will undergo a dramatic transformation more befitting of its name. The renovation reimagines the rectangular red building into a contemporary edifice with classical Islamic features: arches, arabesque designs, and a minaret inspired by the cathedral’s partial bell tower. But not all Quebec City Muslims favour the design. One group feels that they should do something beautiful to present the mosque as part of Québécois culture, like the old church, as a sign that they don’t have anything to hide, said Zied Kallel, who leads the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec’s strategic committee.Another section of the community, including Kallel, worries the architecture – especially the minaret – could provoke further attacks and undermine recent security measures.A third group disagrees with those very safety measures, especially automatically locking doors, preferring the mosque be open 24 hours a day, in the spirit of those in much of the Muslim world.But unlike those mosques, the Grand Mosque is central to the immigrant Muslim community. The Quebec Islamic Cultural Center runs a Sunday school, Arabic class, nursery and family activities inside. “Running them has been hard because families are afraid of going there,” said Amira ‪Boulmerka, the director of the Islamic School of Quebec. Several families stopped coming to the mosque, while others have left Quebec entirely. “It should be accessible 24 hours,” said ‪Boulmerka, “but in light of the upheavals and major issues of the world, I don’t think mosques should be permanently open – and they can’t be without surveillance.”As one of the US’s largest and most iconic mosques, it is a frequent target of threats, harassment and anti-Muslim protests. After a pastor infamous for burning Qur’ans vowed to do the same at the Michigan mosque, in 2011, they started hiring on-site personnel. Depending on the day – or headlines of the day – it’s protected by as many as three patrolmen. “We can put a barbed-wire fence, put up metal detectors, x-ray machines, but the end result is that nobody would want to come,” said Allie.The Islamic Society of Greater Houston never locked doors at its 20 mosques until a recent rash of arsons and vandalism at Texas mosques. Now they’re locked up after Isha’a, the last of five daily prayers. They also hired a sheriff’s department and security firm to audit and help implement recommendations for each temple. Others around the country report installing emergency exits, elaborate camera systems, bulletproof glass and coded keypads.Costs run as high as $200,000. In Canada, the federal government covers half the expense. The program has formally existed since 2012, but most past recipients were Jewish groups. After the armed assault on the Grand Mosque, an unprecedented number of organizations applied for the funding. Now as many as two-thirds of recipients are Muslim groups.The Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec had long invested in security enhancements before Bissonnette’s killing spree. Indeed, multi-camera footage was key evidence during at his trial. “Access was programmed according to the times of the day – 10 minutes before prayer, and 10 minutes after,” explained Aymen Derbali, whose only memory of trying to stop Bissonnette was from the video. Isha’a prayer had already finished when the assailant entered the door and started shooting. Had Bissonnette come a few minutes later, Derbali might be able to walk today.The centre now requires worshippers to apply for inidual access cards and prohibits children from opening doors to outside. One survivor of the tragedy monitors the camera feeds live from his apartment a block away.More enhancements are expected with the reconstruction, but safety is only part of the goal. The main purpose was expansion. Though the renderings were only presented to worshippers last year, they were drawn up by a Muslim architect from the mosque and a local firm two years before the tragedy. They never expected to have the funds to execute the million-dollar project so soon, but an outpouring of charitable donations could make it possible this year.“It’s sad to say, but we are famous because of what happened,” said Kallel. “The problem isn’t with the money, it’s with the planning.”In the 1990s, fundraising for the mosque’s first iteration took three years to reach its $120,000 goal. The community was a few hundred Muslims then, most of them North African immigrants who had come to study. As they earned middle-class careers and the community outgrew the space, it took another three years to raise the down payment on the former bank in 2008. But the Grand Mosque has struggled to keep up with the city’s growing Muslim population, including many refugees, now estimated at 15,000.“It just gets so full, it’s so tiny, and I don’t like the fact that women are upstairs following the imam on a TV,” said Kallel’s wife, who asked to go by “Yasmin”, fearing harassment. “I wish we could have a real mosque inside, so when you go to pray you really feel like going to pray.” She has, however, some reservations about the impressive new plans. “I wouldn’t want to hide, but I wouldn’t want to attract attention either.”For supporters of the aesthetic redesign, the architecture has become even more important since the tragedy. “Maybe it will be more beautiful and attractive for people who want to learn about Islam,” said Derbali. “The first message we have to give to the population is we are not afraid.”Maybe so, but Quebec is a particularly hostile environment for Muslims. Anti-Muslim hate crimes in Quebec City doubled in the year since the attack. Two of the 42 reported cases involved excrement being thrown at the mosque and the past president’s car being set on fire. In October 2017, Quebec’s Liberal government passed a bill banning women in niqabs from receiving public services as basic as transit, while a newly elected rightwing party plans to expand those laws to prohibit civil servants from wearing any religious symbol at work.Given the environment, some worshippers would prefer the mosque to relocate entirely. But for Derbali, praying at the same mosque, albeit now from a wheelchair, has been therapeutic. When he finally returned for Friday prayers, seven months later, he struggled to retain his composure. “I had some tears in my eyes, because I got a flashback of what happened and remembered the murders of all the brothers, and the ones who were injured,” he said. “But in order to pass through this tragedy, I have to face it another time.”To mitigate post-traumatic triggers, the prayer hall was repainted on the recommendations of trauma scene specialists, who also recommended replacing the carpet. The board, however, opted to replace only the damaged sections.Now, when Kallel sees the rolled-up patches of green and pink rug sitting in the mosque’s basement, he feels a sense of unease. Not because they have been marked with bullet holes and the blood of his friends, but because he fears they will soon be discarded. He feels the country has already forgotten and moved on. So just as the hollowed cathedral is maintained as a reminder of its Jesuit roots and its role in the Seven Years’ War, Zied wants these tragic artefacts to stand as reminders of the worst mass murder in a Canadian place of worship.Bullet holes remain in a ceiling above a storage area, where worshippers took refuge, and through a bathroom door, where another narrowly escaped death. And despite their efforts, there are at least two holes left in the carpet. “We cannot just wipe off everything and turn the page,” said Kallel. “You have to have something symbolic. People should remember.”Omar Mouallem is an Alberta-based journalist and author of the forthcoming book, Praying to the West, a travel memoir about Muslims in the Americas.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec04309793067780f68d7bd5e088110130b3e579/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf976fdb0de9342225e759f40f66c5d","title":"tollywood confidential inside the worlds biggest film city","story":"The next 15 megacities #11: As Hyderabad heads towards megacity status, its film industry is going from strength to strength. Its secret? Cutting-edge VFX and filming in multiple languagesby  Tash Reith-Banks in HyderabadIt is rush hour on Monday morning in Hyderabad, but the city’s usual deafening soundtrack of revving engines and blaring horns is absent. The only noise comes from a woman gently sweeping the veranda of one of the large, pastel-coloured mansions nearby. The silence is even more disconcerting when you see the airport near the end of the street, and, just beyond that, a railway station. New York’s Statue of Liberty is a short walk away, as is the splendour of the ancient city of Mahishmati. In fact, Mahishmati is the first place here where I encounter any real noise – the blue special effects screens around the fibreglass throne area are rather flimsy, and a buzz from power tools carries from the adjoining parking lot, where workers are building a pirate ship.We are in Ramoji Film City, the largest film studio in the world and the beating heart of Tollywood, India’s Telugu-language film industry. And although Ramoji is technically part of Hyderabad, in reality – with its (real) hotels, workshops, soundstages, gardens, post office, banks and restaurants – it is a metropolis in and of itself.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.It is not Hyderabad’s only “city within a city”. To many outside India, the southern Indian metropolis is best known for Hitech City – the country’s own purpose-built Silicon Valley. Nearby is Genome Valley, which boasts manufacturing and R\u0026ampD arms of some of the biotech sector’s biggest names.Hyderabad owes much of its rapid growth to the jobs created for these companies, both directly and from the construction boom resulting from the need for offices, homes and infrastructure to accommodate the influx of labour. Its expansion has seen it swallow up its twin city of Secunderabad to become one sprawling metropolis.The latest UN projections forecast that Hyderabad will reach megacity status – having a population over 10 million – by 2020, with 14.1 million residents by 2035. But when you are caught in the inevitable snarl of the city’s legendarily bad traffic and surrounded on all sides by construction projects, it is hard not to agree with locals who say that, thanks to unofficial migrant workers, the 10 million population point has long since been passed.India has the largest film industry in the world, producing 1,903 films in 2016 compared with 200 made in Britain and 798 made in the US. The Hindi-language output of Bollywood, with its bright colours, catchy soundtracks and spectacular dance sequences, is the first – and sometimes only – thing that springs to the outsider’s mind when Indian film is mentioned, but Bollywood only accounts for a small proportion of the country’s films. Tollywood’s output is almost as large and the return for investors on each of its pictures tends to be better.Every film studio is a little like a small town, with multiple catering locations, shops, backlots, transport, workshops and security. Studios need space, which is why many UK studios are built on former manor estates or Ministry of Defence airfields, while some of Hollywood’s biggest studios were based around ranches or large colonial mansions. But Hyderabad’s Ramoji Film City dwarfs them all. As well as the standard studio facilities, Ramoji also offers permanent sets including a prison, an elaborate hilltop temple, and a village with a town square. In the west, permanent sets are rare nowadays, partly because of the rise in land prices and taxation in cities like Los Angeles, but also because of their poorly disguised overuse in Hollywood films until the 1970s. (Although Ramoji’s one-stop shop model emulates golden age-era Hollywood, Ramoji was only built in 1996, the same year as Hitech City.)This increasing technical competence is part of what has begun to set Tollywood apart in Indian film, exemplified by the two-part blockbuster Baahubali, filmed at Ramoji, where some of the sets remain as a tourist attraction. Baahubali: The Conclusion is the second highest-grossing Indian film in history, and both parts used visual effects (VFX) to an extent and with a complexity not previously seen in Indian film. Although a number of studios were involved, the main players were based in Hyderabad.Hyderabad, as a magnet for software developers and programmers, has a swiftly growing VFX industry, but on the whole its labs currently deal with less creative and more labour-intensive work outsourced by large western and Chinese companies. Khan says this will change: “We are inculcating VFX artists and VFX supervisors to be on a par with international levels and slowly we’ll see more of work being completely outsourced here. We’re in the transformation stage from being that BT outsource call centre to being the actual customer service.”And as Hyderabad’s IT dominance increases, so too does the number of Telugu, Malayalam and Tamil-speaking workers heading overseas to work for major companies – and their enthusiasm for cinema does not alter with distance. “Today, every filmmaker’s target is diaspora in the US, UK and Europe besides Africa and the Gulf,” explains Murthy. With modern digital distribution methods, this means that more cinemas worldwide are now showing Tollywood’s output, while platforms such as Netflix have massively increased the potential audience.The response to this growth in diaspora audience is increasingly to make films targeted at them. As Murthy points out, Tollywood films are “aimed at satisfying and impressing the diaspora about what they are missing in their native lands. Most of the Telugu films shoot their songs and some sequences in the US or UK or Europe background.” With wider distribution comes a demand for increasingly sophisticated offerings, acknowledges Khan: “Now when our content is going up on, say, Netflix or Amazon, if quality-wise we’re not at par with international content, an Indian viewer also will not watch what we are putting out. You know he has the option of watching Narcos if our crime series is not popular enough.”If Ramoji Film City’s studio-based vision seems old-fashioned to the Netflix generation, this does not appear to trouble owner Ramoji Rao. He is also looking to the digital future with a very real news media empire, centred on three working office blocks that sit amid the studio fakery. There, alongside his newspaper and news TV operations, is a news video app currently in the testing stages. Each Indian state is represented, with its own studio and team of editors and presenters based at Ramoji, while reporters throughout the country send back a stream of national and hyper-local news bulletins. The aim is for any app subscriber to have access to 24-hour news from their home state, in their own language – an ambitious undertaking in a country made up of 29 states with 22 different languages. If the project pays off, it could make Hyderabad not just the film capital of the south, but the media capital of India – and as it takes its place as a megacity, it seems certain to become a serious player on the global stage.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef3f936eff48df6dad54c1e708811918ee809bb/0_109_6557_3935/master/6557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8284c94ef1a8d2c6fb12c5d88b57cbd1","title":"britannia rules waves brexit floundering","story":"P\u0026ampO’s decision to ditch the British flag shows the decline of our rich seafaring traditionNever underestimate the Brexit romance, the tug for an island nation set in a silver sea unconquered for 10 centuries, proud of its insularity. The idea of the sea wrenches at British heartstrings: you can hear it when you listen to the language of the Brexit groundswell. Normandy landings, D-day pluck, empire, sailors – leave voters use this imagery, however far from the shore.Brexit leaders rub in that seafaring imagery but here’s the paradox: these buccaneers promoting free markets on the high seas are the same deregulators who have helped destroy British shipping.What irony that P\u0026ampO Ferries has announced that Brexit is forcing it to deregister from Britain, putting its entire fleet under the Cypriot flag. No red duster will now ply the channel from Dover to Calais, only foreign flags. Rule the waves? We won’t even have a British red ensign flying across the Channel. Once foreign-flagged, P\u0026ampO ferries can’t be requisitioned for any no-deal Brexit crisis.The 180-year-old “Peninsular and Orient” line is steeped in the kind of British history our Brexiteers celebrate. Founded in the wake of the Napoleonic wars, it shipped the empire: profiting from the opium war, it transported 632,000 tons of opium from Bengal to China. Under royal charter it delivered the Royal Mail to India and in the postwar years it carried more than a million “£10 Poms” – British emigrants to populate Australia. It lost 85 ships in the first world war, 179 in the second. Decline began with India’s independence in 2006 it was sold to Dubai.How perverse that Brexit – designed to bolster quintessential Britishness – has caused the final loss of P\u0026ampO Ferries to the British flag. “For operational and accounting reasons, we have concluded that the best course of action is to re-flag all ships to be under the Cyprus flag,” says P\u0026ampO. Registering in Cyprus will “result in fewer inspections and delays”, with “significantly more favourable tonnage tax arrangements as the ships will be flagged in an EU member state”.It will indeed be easier to operate from inside the EU. It promises no change in working conditions, for now. Yet Brexit will be a problem for British crews, who need certificates of competency. Once their certificates lapse, as with other professions and trades, it may take years before the EU recognises UK qualifications: we’ll join a long queue of countries applying and without recognised certificates, British citizens can’t work.Some two-thirds of ratings on ships registered with the UK Chamber of Shipping come from low-paying non-EEA countries. Unlike most immigration fears, this is a genuine case of foreign labour undercutting British employees, as there’s no lack of British young people yearning for a life at sea. Nautilus, the union for professional mariners, says 10 well-qualified young people apply for every apprenticeship. Though companies are obliged to do some training, they rarely take on apprentices once trained. Why should they, when they can pay at least a third less and still comply with global minimum standards?T here was a reason why P\u0026ampO chose Cyprus, out of plentiful other EU countries. Why not France, the obvious choice for plying the channel? Because France is unionised, with high standards. Cyprus is a flag of convenience, despite being in the EU. Over half the world’s ships are now registered under flags of convenience. In countries such as Panama, Liberia, Singapore and the Marshall Islands, it’s cheap to register, tax is low, and standards are the bare legal minimum. There are few inspections for safety, food, clean water, rest hours and conditions for crews.In the deregulating 1980s, British shipping joined a global free-for-all. This is exactly the behaviour the EU should prevent, with stricter rules about who uses its ports. The US has its 1920s Jones Act forbidding any but US-built, -owned and -crewed ships plying from one US port to another. Why hasn’t the EU done likewise? In the fiercely competitive global shipping market, only the EU can stop a downward plunge in pay, conditions and safety.Yet again, Britain is to blame, acting as drag-anchor on EU progress. A manning directive was proposed to keep crews of ships sailing between EU ports protected by EU pay and conditions, but Britain helped the ship-owners sabotage the plan. The UK also chooses to issue the most certificates of equivalent competency to foreign crews, less well-trained and paid, undercutting its own mariners but pleasing the shipping lobby. We even let foreign ships and crews sail to and from our ports to our own oil platforms and wind farms.Britain’s role in the EU has too often been to stop progressive employment laws: remember our shameful opting out of the social chapter, until the Labour government opted us back in. How surprising that EU citizens still say they want us to stay. Yet more surprising are the few trade unions who back Brexit. Researching the P\u0026ampO story, I was called by Mick Cash, head of the RMT, representing ratings. So I asked why he backs Brexit, when it would be easier to win strong shipping regulation from within the EU. The victorious Brexiteers will be ideologically opposed to creating better British working practices: they are the ultimate deregulators. But Cash says he still reckons Britain alone will, in some future halcyon day, be more free to set its own better rules independent of the rest of Europe. Most unions and the TUC disagree – as does Nautilus, deeply alarmed at the likely damage done by Brexit.P\u0026ampO is just one case of Brexit flight, as other big companies threaten disinvestment and departure. But P\u0026ampO taking the opportunity to fly a flag of convenience stands as a warning for how post-Brexit Britain will try to compete by deregulating and undercutting. Today’s Westminster “battle of the amendments” may seem remote to many, but the next few weeks will settle the future for us all for decades – for better or very much worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69ae4aaab50f67f7f3ade378f960bd50e64b6ffc/6_491_2080_1248/master/2080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71e206e4900b7d4b88f2a659d67c5f4","title":"james charles zoella youtube celebrity culture","story":"When a YouTuber brings Birmingham city centre to a standstill, it’s time to do more than pride yourself on ignoranceThere is a particular breed of middle-aged man that prides itself on not knowing who Kim Kardashian is. “What’s that?” they cry in comment sections throughout the land, “What’s a Kim Kardashian?”. This performative I’m-too-busy-with-books-to-even-turn-on-the-TV intelligence usually backfires immediately (you’re telling me you’ve read 10,000 books but can’t discern that “Kimberly” is a woman’s name?)Pretending not to know who celebrities are to seem clever is likely an age-old phenomenon (Spartacus? Never heard of him) but thankfully, you no longer have to pretend. After makeup artist and YouTuber James Charles brought Birmingham to a standstill on Sunday – with traffic gridlocked as thousands of teenage fans flocked to see the 19-year-old at a shopping centre – many people are realising that they actually, genuinely haven’t the foggiest who 2019’s celebrities are.It’s now easier than ever to be out of the loop. Charles has almost 14m subscribers on his beauty-based YouTube channel, making him firmly famous by any measure. Yet the reaction to his Birmingham appearance has been everything from confused to outwardly hostile.“What a sad society we’ve turned into,” wrote one person in (where else but) a Facebook comment section, “Yes, people used to flock to get a glimpse of the Beatles, but the Beatles were writing amazing songs.” Another writes: “The world has definitely gone mad.” Sticking to the tried-and-tested theme, yet another adds: “You can’t compare it with the Beatles, different class.”Let’s give it a go, shall we? In 2014, CBS reported that the Beatles have sold 1.6bn singles in the United States since the 60s – in just three years, James Charles has accumulated 1.1bn views on his YouTube channel. The Beatles’ hair (which was unusually long for the time) was mocked by adults in the press who considered it androgynous Charles has been disparaged by the aforementioned internet commenters as a “boy in makeup”. Both are arguably revolutionary.“Aha!” you twist and shout. “But the Beatles were talented!” Charles undeniably has talent (get back to me when you can do a rainbow cut crease) but it’s equally undeniable that there are now huge swathes of “talentless” YouTube celebrities who do nothing but talk to the camera about imagined internet drama. So the world has definitely gone mad, yeah? THIS IS THE END? Sure, if you ignore thousands of years of human history in which talentless idiots were celebrated with power, pounds, and prestige (for research purposes, start with nearly every royal ever).Rather than getting angry at this new celebrity culture, we should accept it (at least in order to have the appropriate infrastructure in place for YouTubers’ public appearances). Of course, there’s no denying that it’s increasingly hard to keep up with our modern, silo-ed celebrities. Charles has more than 13 million subscribers, and so do Eleonora Maronese, Roi Fabito, Rachel Levin, Guillermo Díaz Ibañez, Wengie Huang, and Nathaniel Peterson. Who? There are now more celebrities than ever before. When Andy Warhol said we’d all have our 15 minutes of fame, I doubt he meant simultaneously.And there are real repercussions for a celebrity culture that takes place almost in secret – not least, howcan parents hope to monitor who is influencing their kids if they’ve never even heard of the influencer in question? One of Britain’s most well-known YouTubers, Zoella, was first covered in a BBC article in 2013 which called her “one of the UK’s most successful young vloggers” – at the time she had 2.5m subscribers. There are now 3,208 YouTubers who have more than 2.5m subscribers.Things are changing so rapidly that it’s hard to keep up – but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t. A year after the mainstream press introduced people to Zoella, her debut novel broke records and became the fastest-selling book of 2014, before it emerged it was written by a ghostwriter. This scandal allowed parents to show children the truth about online stars who pretend to be their best friends – it was an important teachable moment. And yet, naturally, the  was disparaged by commenters at the time for writing “about a girl with a gloriously over-hyped book”.Snarky comments don’t help anyone, and we should recognise ignorance of celebrity culture as being just that – ignorance. I’m not saying you need to memorise all 3,208 YouTubers with over 2.5m subscribers – but when a person you’ve never heard of brings Britain’s second-largest city to a standstill, maybe Google them before scrolling to the comment section to type “WHO???”.• Amelia Tait is a journalist who writes about tech and internet phenomena"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed5be6183a442ed57653e379cd110501ce33953a/0_129_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37d9187e80565b7f5068b794b7ceb80e","title":"nick clegg facebook unpopular","story":"The former deputy PM is used to taking the rap for unpopular policies. But the Facebook gig could be a poisoned chaliceOnce upon a time there was a Tumblr account called Nick Clegg Looking Sad, which consisted almost entirely of pictures of the then deputy prime minister looking miserable.It doesn’t seem to have been updated since the 2015 general election, presumably because that represented peak misery, but I was reminded of it on Tuesday when Clegg made his first outing as spin doctor for Facebook. He had been given some happy news to impart, including the creation of a centre for electoral integrity to try to fight political disinformation campaigns aimed at skewing elections. But the pained expression crept in when confronted on TV with examples of the kind of graphic Instagram posts that 14-year-old Molly Russell’s bereaved parents believe had a bearing on their daughter’s suicide, and asked whether he would want his own children to see them. There is something horribly familiar about the sight of Clegg publicly squirming over the consequences of things he doesn’t quite have the power to stop, as if the coalition years were happening all over again in slow motion.Former party leaders have to do something with the rest of their lives, obviously. Like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before him, Clegg is far too young to retire, and it seems he has said all he wants to say about Brexit. A corporate gig does at least beat making expensive speeches to bankers or offering private advice to foreign governments with murky human rights records. But the sight of a former deputy prime minister spinning for Mark Zuckerberg feels nonetheless symbolic of everything that is wrong with the relationship between big tech and politics. Clegg used to help run the country, and now Facebook seems to be running him. Is that really the way it’s meant to work?There has been a revolving door between Whitehall and Silicon Valley for many years now, with a steady stream of former special advisers being snapped up by the Googles and the Ubers and the Facebooks. It makes sense on one level – both politics and tech are bewilderingly fast-moving, complex environments with significant impact on ordinary lives and people who have worked in one are perhaps unusually suited to working in the other – but it also illustrates the problem. The single biggest threat to the seemingly unstoppable rise of the tech oligarchs would be a government with teeth, prepared either to regulate platforms more strictly or to tax them more heavily. These companies, like any company, will naturally seek to anticipate and where possible frustrate any political threat to their business model. The obvious way of doing that is hiring people with understanding of, and preferably influence over, the political process.But the Facebook empire (which also includes Whatsapp and Instagram among other platforms) now has a broader reputational problem, too. Even if it could square off the politicians, its own users don’t like what they are hearing about everything from invasions of their personal privacy to the toxification of public debate and the role of social media in fuelling the rise of far-right movements. By hiring a politician rather than an anonymous former special adviser, Facebook seems to be trying to engage directly with the public.It’s a risk for both sides. Politicians are used to articulating their own views, not parroting other people’s, and it may take Clegg a while to get used to answering questions about the limits of regulation in Zuckerberg’s voice rather than his own. But the bigger reputational risk is perhaps to Clegg personally, and, by association, the Liberal Democrats in general, whose members care more than most about questions of privacy, freedom of speech and civil liberties.He has presumably gone in believing that Facebook really does want to be a force for good now that it’s better to be in the room when the decisions are taken than outside railing hopelessly against them, and that whatever concessions he can extract are worth the awkward compromises that will sometimes need to be made. And yes, all that may sound a bit familiar to Liberal Democrats who lived through the coalition years. Let’s hope that’s not an omen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a34efc0aba181ae5743667105db7af42a4f6aae/0_198_5555_3335/master/5555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7f2b169fbd4a2dc10f3c4b1600b6dc","title":"tory brexit malthouse compromise backstop ireland border","story":"There is considerable excitement in the Conservative party on Tuesday morning. It looks like a deal has been reached on Brexit. There’s just one problem, that, from what we can gather of the so-called “Malthouse compromise”, it stands no chance of being acceptable to the EU.There seem to be three fundamentals to the plan: the extension of the implementation period to 2021, technological solutions to ensure no border infrastructure requirements on the island of Ireland, and an interim free trade agreement to be tabled immediately. This has been termed a “triple-lock”.The first element is uncontroversial and indeed already part of the draft withdrawal agreement between the EU and UK. It means a standstill period during which trade carries on as before, and the UK continues to follow EU rules and trade policy, including a common external tariff.It is the second and third parts that are almost certain to be unacceptable to the EU. Technological solutions for the Irish border have been endlessly debated, but there is no border in the world outside of the EU where there are no physical checks, including the often cited Norway-Sweden and Switzerland-EU borders. Only where both countries are in a customs union and have more or less the same product regulations backed by a common court have checks been eliminated.For customs checks to decide whether tariffs are payable, a border is the only place where you always get the transport, declaration, supporting documents and goods together at the same time. Without this, the opportunities for smuggling are too great, and it should be remembered that checks are based on a risk-management approach, aimed at smugglers rather than regular traders.The backstop is a firm red line for the commission, and there are numerous reasons why it will not be changed. The EU will demonstrate that its word cannot be trusted if it reverses. It is a guarantee promised to a member state, and to prioritise the interests of a soon-to-be third country over a member state would be devastating to the EU’s credibility. It has consistently rejected the view that technology solutions could replace a border. Finally, the EU does not trust the UK not to backslide from a vague no-border commitment, based on the fact that so many in the UK have downplayed the issue.The interim free trade agreement, to be tabled immediately, would not help avoid border checks. Even without tariffs there is no full free trade outside of a customs union, for rules of origin must be checked to ensure the product is eligible for a zero tariff, for example to stop a Chinese product being rebadged and passed off as a UK product. The agreement also envisages UK regulations differing from those in the EU.And the chances of the EU accepting an interim free trade agreement, drawn up in a matter of days or weeks, are close to zero. The EU typically takes upwards of five years to reach such agreements, in large part to make sure it is a good deal that will benefit the whole economy and has widespread support among member states. The UK would be wise to take the time needed in order to achieve this, not least because sensitive questions, such as which food standards and other regulations we should follow, are bound to be controversial.There is a mistaken belief that the prime minister will be strengthened by a unified Conservative party position. However such a position has to be realistic, and one that directly attacks the most fundamental red line of the European commission is not. It is almost as if the commission suggested the UK abandoned its commitment to end freedom of movement. On the contrary, this compromise is likely to infuriate the EU and member states, who will see in it a continued failure of the UK to grapple with the choices brought by Brexit, and a rerun of ideas already rejected.• David Henig is director of the UK Trade Policy Project at the European Centre for International Political Economy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423e46473008ac5c7d15d8b95a28653baeffcb62/0_365_4061_2436/master/4061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421ced7651d94a0619a58f170b235c9d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sweet","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sweet’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sweet’.Share your photos of what sweet means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 30 January at 10am.

Here are six renting tips At Marina Stanimirovic’s seven-bed student house in Clapton, East London, shared living spaces had been turned into bedrooms, walls were damp and there were mushrooms growing from the corners of the floor. Stanimirovic was studying for a master’s at the Royal College of Art. She had moved from Paris and found the room on Gumtree for £600 per month, cash in hand. She says she was exploited. “Living in a small room is one thing, but living in a disgusting space is different. I was too naive to see how awful it was and very vulnerable as the landlady could kick us out anytime.”Manchester University graduate Mathilda Wilde, 21, had a similar experience last year. “There’s this myth that you’re meant to live in a bad house, that it’s a part of uni culture and you should just deal with it,” she says. “My friend got unwell from the mould in her room and all they did was give her a dehumidifier, they didn’t even try to get rid of it.”Experiences like this are not uncommon. New research from Mojo Mortgages says more than a third of students think they have been treated unfairly by a landlord and students are getting ripped off for rent in the majority of UK university cities. From damp, excessive cold, pests and faulty appliances to exploitative fees and safety concerns, students can encounter a range of issues. Whether it’s university halls or privately rented accommodation, here’s how to deal with them.At the very least, you should expect a safe and habitable place to live. To help define what precisely these standards are, the Shelter guidelines are a good place to start.If you think you’re living in poor housing conditions, find out if you have a direct relationship with the landlord or university, or whether there is a managing agent who authorises repairs. “Clarify what the process is for addressing any issues as they crop up,” says James Davis, CEO of online letting agency Upad. Inform the landlord or managing agent as soon as possible. “This will not only show you as a responsible tenant, but also avoid the stress of living with the issue.”Some landlords and agents know that students are often renting for the first time and try to get away with poor management practices. When problems arise, take photographs and make sure all communications are in writing.If there’s a hazard in the house – such as dangerous electrics, fire risks, mould or a faulty boiler – and the landlord won’t fix it, contact the council. You can dispute any money they might try to deduct at the end of the tenancy.“If a private renter complains to their local authority about disrepair, the council has a legal duty to inspect and take action to get the landlord to fix it,” says Hannah Slater from Generation Rent. Each council has a housing team and you can find their details on your local authorities website.Many student properties are houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), and as of the end of last year it is a national requirement for these to be licensed by the local authority. “It’s recognised that poor conditions and property standards are prevalent in HMOs, so local authorities should be proactively trying to drive up standards,” explains Slater.Students often sign contracts months in advance so it can be difficult to leave, make improvements or alter their terms. However contracts are agreements between two parties, so it is important that you realise your own rights as part of that. If you are looking for support your students’ union should provide this.Don’t let the landlord push the blame on to you. “Students are already struggling financially and going deep into their overdraft. The expectation that they should put up with things like dripping taps or mould appearing is ridiculous,” says Jessica Raspin, co-chair of Hull University Labour club.The government is banning letting agent fees for renters signing new contracts from 1 June this year – but if you are signing or renewing a tenancy agreement between now and that date, you will still be liable for any fees. However, it is worth challenging fees in contracts between now and then and shopping around for an agent like OpenRent, which already does not charge tenants any fees.Be prepared to dispute deductions from the deposit if you feel charges are unfair. The burden of proof is on the landlord, and if they are unable to prove the damage was caused during the current tenancy they won’t be able to claim against you. “Completing a detailed inventory is a good way to protect damage deposits from spurious claims,” says Cooper Healey, manager at Manchester Student Homes.At the end of the year, when others are looking around your home and you’re making your exit plans, let them know if the property isn’t up to scratch. As one fed up University of Liverpool student put it: “I can’t wait for people to come and view my uni house so I can tell them about the brown ceiling water, the mess, the mice, the slugs, the cold, the mould, the damp, the cold water, the sadness and the nine people living in one house.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf5daf2b5f80328c78daa9ac98f39d0cba4893f4/257_338_2970_1783/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46435013a9068f24a45db4ded96c488f","title":"above and below the great australian bight a photo essay","story":"The Rainbow Warrior III has spent the past two months sailing Australia’s southern waters, bolstering the fight to protect the bightby Alana Holmberg and Michaela SkovranovaThe ship sets sail and we brace our legs against the swell, sweeping and mopping around the cabins. Countering the tilt we work quickly and silently, trying not to wake any crew who had been on watch the previous night. Not even celebrities and photographers are spared the daily 8am chores, the ship’s third mate, Amrit Bakshi, tells us later, laughing.That was our first morning on board the Rainbow Warrior III, one of the world’s most recognisable sailing ships and a symbol of environmental activism. Visiting Australia for only the third time since it was custom-built for Greenpeace in 2011, the ship came to explore the wild and untouched waters of the Great Australian Bight, due south of the Nullarbor Plain.The bight is our wild, uncompromising underwater backyard. Kilometres of red earth and sand dunes drop off rugged cliffs into great expanses of deep, pristine ocean. A e in these waters reveals another world. It’s a place where leafy sea dragons live and thousands of cuttlefish aggregate to breed. It’s home to the puppies of the sea – the endangered Australian sea lion – and a highway for the largest creatures in this world, also endangered, the southern right whale.To protect these creatures and the isolated fishing communities dotted along this coastline, environmental groups have been fighting to keep big oil companies from drilling in the bight since the Australian government granted BP four offshore exploration permits in 2011. BP has since pulled out, as did Chevron, however Norwegian company Equinor (formerly Statoil) plans to be drilling by October this year. Earlier this month, only days after the Rainbow Warrior left Australian waters, NOPSEMA (the regulatory agency for offshore oil drilling) approved an application for seismic surveys off the coast of Kangaroo Island and Eyre peninsula from 1 September for three months.A turbulent ocean greeted us as we neared Greenly Island. We were 30 kilometres west-south-west of Point Whidbey on Eyre peninsula, South Australia, and an eerie grey cloud clung to the island’s granite peak. As Michaela and the other three ers descended to depths of 30 metres, they found themselves between underwater mountains dressed in kelp that danced with the current. A curious sea lion came to investigate their strange-looking flippers. As they explored the ledges sheltered from the swell surge, an array of sea life was revealed – fish nurseries, rarely seen sponges, corals and an explosion of colour, shape and life.Over the course of a week, e after e revealed an abundance of life and plethora of species. Some difficult to identify as these areas have not been well-documented compared with other marine parks in Australia. When the ers surfaced, the questions began. How was the e? What did you see? Any sharks?Similarly, when the underwater remote operated vehicle (ROV) trawled the ocean floor, a genuine interest in those seldom-explored deep underwater environments was palpable among those on board.Appreciation for this valuable ecosystem permeated the floating micro-community and it was infectious. We found it impossible to remain indifferent after what we witnessed above and below the surface of the Great Australian Bight.For photographers, unless you’re covering breaking news or sports, it’s rare to work alongside each other for extended periods of time. Looking back now, that first morning cleaning the floors and smelling of vinegar was the beginning of a unique shared experience in the untamed Australian marine environment, one we feel compelled to share."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809dfd7794a56d3bc1892297977fbf06fa3aecd6/0_328_5104_3063/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d28739f14606e9d11cd0752e852174bb","title":"the aw19 takeaway 10 of the best menswear trends from the shows a photo essay","story":"After one month, three cities and hundreds of shows, the trends for autumn are in. Here is a breakdown of what happened – and what it means for your autumn wardrobeby  Helen Seamons,  Morwenna Ferrier and  Matt FidlerThe autumnwinter 2019 menswear shows were full of comebacks and firsts. Milan hosted blockbuster shows from Prada, Versace and even Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, treading carefully after last year’s China racism row. Paris was packed and cold, but saw universally successful debuts from Hedi Slimane at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy. Craig Green returned to the London schedule alongside Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who had a plaid party in a warehouse, and A-Cold-Wall*, which put a doberman on the catwalk. Scarves were long, bags were big and for the first time in four seasons, tailoring triumphed over tracksuits. Here are the other trends we can expect to see next autumn.Rare is the season in which leopard print is absent from womenswear … but menswear? It’s hardly a perennial. Yet this season it was, appearing in all shades and motifs, brash and textured. At John Lawrence Sullivan, it appeared on coats and bomber jackets in clear 70s prints. At Marni, it ran the gamut – from creepers and fluffy coats, to hats and wide-legged trousers, lending the whole collection a cartoonish edge. Neil Barrett put it on collars and Sacai doubled it up, but few expected to see a mod-style leopard-print coat in a quiet shade of gold. Some labels can change their spots, it seems.This season, the death knell rang out for sportswear. Well, not quite, but the suit gave it a run for its money. Black versions that were edgy and funereal at the same time led the charge. In Paris, they were elegant, crisp and flowing at Dries van Noten, relaxed and casual at Valentino, and serious and winter-proof at Dunhill. At Dior, they came red-carpet ready with a detachable sash.Over in Milan, Prada and Fendi showed versions with a high-octane glamour and feminine undertone – think shine and a slim cut that was pleasing to watch on the catwalk. Stella McCartney went for a back-to-school version. At Berluti, Kris Van Assche closed the show with a his-and-hers version – because how many trends overlap genders quite so keenly?The autumn catwalks were a riot of colour this season, yet one shade ruled them all. Surprisingly, for a world that has been saturated by millennial pink and all the cultural and gender baggage that comes with it, here it was used with nuance, clashing with green or layered up at Ami and Acne Studios (the same Acne Studios that put it on a bag and launched a thousand copycats). At Loewe, Anderson turned it into a suit over comically oversized shirting, a fun combination which clashed magically with the mustard carpet.Craig Green and Marni went for head to toe, playing with textures and fabrics – high shine or knitted, this was a “choose your weapon” moment. At Raf Simons, in his first show since news of his departure from Calvin Klein, the takeaway moment was a voluminous pink trenchcoat – no belt – styled in a loose, carefree way. “I want to do something abstract and beautiful and elegant and proud and sophisticated, but without losing the edge of what the brand stands for: the young generation,” he told Vogue. Touche.As ever, leather was a recurring theme at the shows this year, though few things will top the Instagram picture of Frank Ocean in a pair of leather Loewe chaps backstage. That said, Isabel Marant’s flying jackets with billowing arms were wearable and a tour de force, while Givenchy’s ultra-tight leather trench (belted, this time) was a lesson in elegance. Jil Sander’s loose-fitting, grey leather shirt and leather trouser combination was aimed at the brave. Ditto Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, who went vintage with his jackets, and Berluti which opened the show at the Palais Garnier opera house with a tan brushed leather suit.This season, men’s fashion continues to work in tandem with the weather, with puffer jackets designed to withstand the polar vortex. A bona fide trend since Balenciaga put them on the 2017 catwalk, they came athleisure-friendly at Iceberg under James Long in London, patched like a Mondrian at Fendi in Milan or low-denier and commuter-friendly at British label, Cottweiler.If oversized, primary-coloured puffer jackets have dominated high and low fashion for the past two years, Rick Owens’ longline versions were a u-turn moment, coming fitted in metallic and monochrome shades. Marni’s Francesco Risso introduced the hybrid coatrobe as outerwear this season, but it was his layered puffers in iced lemon which stole the show. Unless you count Cardi B’s onoff boyfriend, Offset, modelling a duvet coat in lilac with a built-in bumbag worn cross-body on the Off White catwalk, accessorised by the scent of vaping.Bags’ shapes wax and wane in fashion. But in menswear this season, they were enormous. In Paris, Hermès showed a men’s version of its cult Birkin bag in deep red, but elsewhere they tended towards sportier shapes. At Louis Vuitton, designer Virgil Abloh created a giant rucksack in grey felt with a subtle monogram, while Loewe created a drawstring bag in pastel leather. Working with a “survivalist” theme, Korean designer Juun.J created silver foil totes which packed down small – this in stark contrast to Xander Zhou whose huge one shouldered bags resembled angel’s wings.Designers took their cue from Mr Tickle this season with scarves of all textures, shapes and colours trailing down the catwalks. At Acne Studios and Valentino they were floor-length and comically proportioned, either tasselled or fine ribbed and thrown over one shoulder.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

There’s hilarious voice-work artistry, ceaselessly inventive pop-culture riffs (“Ooooh – reference!” says someone), eyeball-popping graphics and a 107-minute nonstop gag-storm of a screenplay from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.My favourite moment of superfluous script brilliance comes when an intensely annoying teenage vampire announces in a sensitive voice: “I also DJ on the side and wear women’s jeans.” My only qualification is that the Lego figures are permitted a supernatural ability to operate in the live-action real world of the family’s house, which is arguably a bit of a cheat – but that’s done with great wit, like everything else.We left the first movie on a note of existential anxiety. The kid in the real-world basement is informed that from now on his younger sister will be playing and the creatures of the Lego universe were horrified by the appearance of Duplo: great big blocks with new pinky-cutesy colours. The masculine world of Lego is threatened.The Duplo figures are, in fact, resident in a distant spaceship and make irregular incursions that the indigenous Lego creatures consider to be hugely aggressive. After years of bitter warfare, their hometown has been grimly renamed Apocalypseburg (“a heckish place to live”), no longer is everything awesome, and the chipper singing of Emmet (tremendously voiced by Chris Pratt) is out of joint with the times. He is increasingly considered inappropriate to what Apocalypseburg needs: a tough warrior. This is especially true of Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), a badass who not so secretly despises Emmet’s inability to master stereotypically manly mannerisms.Then the creatures of Duplo arrive with an order: Apocalypseburg’s foremost citizens must travel to the distant outpost of Sustar to attend a wedding. Their enemies’ leader Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (voiced by Tiffany Haddish) has imperiously announced her desire to get hitched to Apocalypseburg’s most eligible unmarried man: Batman (growlingly voiced by Will Arnett) who furiously announces that he wishes to remain a “Bat-chelor”. Is this an overture of friendship or an insidious plan to undermine our heroes’ masculine toughness and self-reliance with the girly stratagem of a wedding?There is no doubt about it: some of the protagonists are beguiled by the avowedly feminised concept of a lavish wedding, but Emmet’s own crisis of masculinity appears solved by the appearance of tough, attractively stubbled adventurer Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), who keeps curtly telling everyone he doesn’t want to explain his backstory before doing just that.TLM2 is speckled with references to 2001: A Space Odyssey (the “stargate” has become the “stairgate”, which leads to the disturbing world beyond the basement), to the Toy Stories and to The Matrix. The characters are periodically besieged by worries about the reality of what they experience and by their own inevitable obsolescence. They are terrified of being banished to the exotic land of “storage”, pronounced like a French word. But the structure and themes of the film have to be perceived within a pointilliste spray of brilliant gags. Each inidual joke is the point the movie keeps delivering a dizzying rush of material. What a rush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2915783302a65457adf269852d0acaab517dcac/346_1491_4340_2603/master/4340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f496fa22ba3776a05b32461bf5eb8fa0","title":"nigel slater butternut soup with tahini and chestnuts recipe","story":"A warming, wholesome, nutty and seedy soup for cold winter nightsPeel and halve 1kg of butternut squash and cut into large chunks.

If the skin is thin, then it is fine not to peel it. If you are using a pumpkin, remove the skin. It is important to process the soup in batches rather than all at once, when it is likely to overflow. A stick blender works a treat.Use mushrooms instead of the chestnuts. I prefer small brown buttons, sliced in halves or quarters and cooked for a minute or two with the sesame oil and rosemary.

So to hold that back or not to use that just seems selfish in a way.”If that is the case, Megan Rapinoe is anything but selfish. A World Cup winner and Olympic champion with the US women’s national team, Rapinoe could easily be satisfied with her lot. But just enjoying the spoils of her success is not enough.Rapinoe has been a vocal advocate for LGBT rights groups since coming out before the 2012 Olympics. She set out to raise $100,000 for those affected by the Carr fire that ripped through her home county, Shasta, last summer, destroying 1,604 buildings as it became the sixth most destructive fire in California history. And, on 4 September, 2016, before kick-off against Chicago Red Stars, the Seattle Reign midfielder went down on one knee during the playing of the national anthem in solidarity with the protest of the San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick.“I think I want the same for myself,” says the 33-year-old, who 11 days later knelt again before USA played Thailand. “Being a white, female, gay athlete. Obviously not everybody is that but it doesn’t mean I don’t want the support for everyone in all of the things I’m fighting for.“We understand that athletes are idolised and glorified in our culture and it was about using that platform to just support and give support to what he was saying. It became a very racialised issue, a black versus white thing, but it’s not.“We all should be supporting what he’s saying. The statistics don’t lie – people of colour in prison, people of colour that are disproportionately arrested, monitored by police, police brutality against people of colour.“It’s not really an issue of whether police brutality exists or not, or whether racism is still an issue or not. It very much is and I think it’s foolish to say it’s not.“The more we reckon with that quickly, recognise that these things are happening and believe the people that are standing up and telling their stories, then the quicker we can find solutions and start to make progress in breaking down those barriers that are so harmful to so many people.”Did she ever fear for her career? Kaepernick has not thrown a football professionally since his release by the 49ers and has a case pending alleging NFL bosses have colluded to keep him out of the game for his stance. “Yeah, I mean as soon as I kneeled they made a rule that you had to stand,” says the creative midfielder nicknamed Rapinho or Rapinodinho.“I don’t know what would have happened if I had continued to kneel, maybe the same thing that happened to Colin. I kind of feel like that’s sort of what they were after. They made it very clear that they were not going to respect my free speech or my decision to peacefully protest in that way and made it very clear that it was unacceptable and that I should be privileged or feel privileged to play for the country. I personally thought it was a very patriotic thing that Colin started.”Despite growing up in the small conservative northern Californian town of Redding, Rapinoe’s social conscience was a natural progression of values ingrained from an early age. “It wasn’t like I grew up in a super liberal household or anything,” she says. “But you never know where people come from, or what their situation is. So you shouldn’t judge people. Give them the benefit of the doubt and be willing to extend yourself and stand up for people who maybe can’t stand up for themselves and just stand up for the right thing. It was never explicitly spoken about in our household but that was just how we were raised.””Obviously we’re at the highest level of this game and it’s given us so much, so to be able to harness that and give back to all these organisations that are already doing the work, already have boots on the ground, is just really cool to be a part of.”The number of female players signing up, despite earning significantly less than their male counterparts, she believes, has its roots in the constant battle for equality at every level of the women’s game. “Women are always at the forefront of all this kind of stuff, racial inequality or pay inequality, maybe because we’re always having to fight for something and we truly understand what gender discrimination looks like and pay inequity looks like. It’s very close to home for us.“We very much understand that it takes bold voices and bold steps to make things change. Our game is changing so much but it also has so much room to grow and we want to be a part of that and we really feel a responsibility to ensure we leave the game in a better place than where we found it. So, I don’t know what it is but maybe women are just better than men in that way.“It’s like men have run the world for all these years, maybe they should just take a few hundred years off,” she laughs. “And we can just take it for a few hundred years and we’ll see where we are.”Has having football in perspective made her a better player? “Yeah, it definitely has.”• A number of deals were announced after the transfer window closed last Thursday. Birmingham have recruited goalkeeper Alex Brooks from Sheffield United Brighton have signed 21-year-old midfielder Megan Connolly following her return to Europe from Florida State University and Reading took Iceland’s Rakel Honnudottir from Swedish side IF Limhamn Bunkeflo 07. • Vivienne Miedema’s second-minute strike against Reading saw her overtake Ellen White’s 15-goal record for a single WSL season with seven games to play. • A Jennifer Hermoso hat-trick helped Atlético Madrid to a 4-1 win over Malaga to maintain their three-point lead over Barcelona, who beat Athletic Club 2-1.

Why are they turning to groups that have traditionally opposed feminism?by  Angelique Chrisafis in Paris,  Kate Connolly in Berlin,  Angela Giuffrida in RomeIt was a chastening lesson for any woman tempted to join the cut and thrust of rightwing populism. After Corinna Miazga was elected to the German parliament in 2017 for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, a male colleague suggested she would be better suited to being a pole dancer than an MP.Miazga did not let it rest, getting her own back by telling a party conference of the lewd intervention by fellow MP Petr Bystron. “An ‘Argh’ went up in the audience,” she recalls. “No one could quite believe I’d dared to reveal this. Many people in the AfD were subsequently angry at me. They said: ‘We know you’re cross, but by bringing this into the public arena, you’ll encourage people to say we have a male-female problem in the party.’”A surge in rightwing populism across Europe over the past 20 years has been largely male-dominated – sometimes characterised as angry white men voting for angry white men. But this is changing. Angry white women are emerging as an important constituency, too. At least half a dozen women lead rightwing, populist European parties, such as Alice Weidel, of the AfD, and Giorgia Meloni, of the Brothers of Italy. They follow the leads set by Marine Le Pen of the National Rally (formerly Front National) and, before her, Pia Kjærsgaard, co-founder of the rampantly anti-immigration Danish People’s party, and Norway’s finance minister, Siv Jensen, leader of the country’s similarly anti-immigration Progress party.A new generation of women aged 20 to 50 are in parliament or local government in countries including Germany, France and Italy, following electoral breakthroughs by rightwing populists.Women are taking to the streets, too. Far-right protests in the UK still tend to be overwhelmingly male, but in continental Europe this is changing. At protest marches in the eastern German city of Chemnitz last year (following gatherings prompted by the stabbing of a local man, allegedly by two immigrants), the neo-Nazi Pegida group had plenty of women in the rank and file. It was similar at a rally last year of Meloni’s Brothers of Italy.In France, large numbers of women have taken to the streets as part of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) anti-government movement, which has attracted people from across the political spectrum from left to far-right, some of whom vote Le Pen, and whose slogans often echo the disillusioned anti-elitism of populism.“There is evidence the gender gap is shrinking in some countries, although it clearly hasn’t disappeared everywhere,” says Eelco Harteveld of the University of Amsterdam.This raises the question: what do women see in nationalist populism that was once so dominated by patriarchal ideology? What motivates women to elect, support and even stand for parties and movements that shrink away from modern-day feminism?Conversations with dozens of European women – voters, MPs and academics – suggest several elements at play.Many working-class women feel just as “left behind” as their male counterparts. The key predictor of a radical-right vote is the level of a person’s education. Harteveld says that although the precarious manual jobs often associated with far-right voters are still largely male preserves, there is also precarious work in the service sector – where women are more numerous. Political scientists in France have pointed to the disillusionment of retail staff and supermarket cashiers as a case in point.“The elite in power hasn’t got a clue what life is like for real people, they’re totally cut off,” says Catherine, a cashier at a budget supermarket north-east of Paris, who has demonstrated with the gilets jaunes. Now in her mid-30s, she has been working on supermarket tills since she left school, and votes for Le Pen.“We can’t make ends meet on low salaries. I’m overdrawn before the end of each month, living on credit, barely able to afford the petrol to get to work or drive my three children where they need to go. We’ve never tried Le Pen in power, so why not give her a chance?” she says.In Italy, the far right has been particularly adept at winning over women who used to vote for the left. “The left represented by the Democratic party in recent years betrayed leftwing voters and leftwing ideals,” says Gianna Gambaccini, a neurologist who became a council member for Matteo Salvini’s far-right Northern League in Pisa last June.But not every female populist sympathiser is from marginalised corners of society. Probably the most important factor in rightwing populism among women is the same as it is for men: attitudes to immigration and Islam. “Top of the list is always a person’s view of immigration,” Harteveld says.Rightwing populist parties are specifically targeting women with a controversial and contested message that immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, brings with it misogynistic cultures that threaten women’s freedom in Europe – from catcalling women in short skirts to sexual assault. As Le Pen put it: “I am scared that the migrant crisis signals the beginning of the end of women’s rights.”A spate of sexual assaults blamed on groups of immigrant men in Cologne and Hamburg on New Year’s Eve at the end of 2015 provided ammunition for the far right to argue that immigrants were a physical threat, even though government studies have found that the vast majority of attacks on German women – including domestic violence – are perpetrated by German men. “I believe we are the only party in Germany who is really fighting for women’s rights, because we point out we’re in danger of losing the freedoms and rights of women for which we’ve fought for centuries,” says the AfD MP Nicole Höchst.Höchst says she is equally concerned for Muslim women living in Germany, many of whom strive to be educated and find a place in German society, “only to find that in the summer holidays they’re going to be married off to a husband they’ve never met in the country their families originated from”.Leaders such as Le Pen are playing a double game. They reject the term “feminism” because they see it as an instrument of the left, and recoil from equality issues such as gender quotas in politics. Yet they co-opt the notion of “women’s rights”when it suits, chiefly as a pretext to attack what they claim is mass immigration by socially conservative men. Every woman must be protected in their right “to wear shorts or a miniskirt”, Le Pen has argued.“These are strong women leaders, but they step back from feminism,” says Susi Meret of Denmark’s Aalborg University. One young Italian mayor, Susanna Ceccardi of the male-dominated Northern League, even insists on being called “sindaco”, the masculine word for “mayor”, as opposed to “sindaca”.These parties believe that “leftwing feminism turns a blind eye to the consequences of immigration,” says Ann-Cathrine Jungar, from Sweden’s Södertörn University.Yet radical-right politicians in Europe know that the stigma and toxic image of a party affects whether female voters choose it. Some have sought to modernise or soften their image in response. Le Pen, who promotes herself as a twice-orced single mother, has sought to tone down her party’s anti-abortion stance, move away from the traditional view of women as childbearers and homemakers, and appeal to gay voters. Jensen, who has warned about the “sneaking Islamisation” of Norwegian society, last year controversially won a “gay best friend” award given out by LGBT activists.The AfD likes to popularise an idealised vision of the nuclear family, with father at work and mother raising children. Miazga speaks of a nostalgia for the deutschmark, for economic stability, social order and the “traditional family”. “I value the traditional family, a sensible time when children were cared for,” she says. “I wish – and maybe this is a funny, romantic feeling – that we could get back to the Germany of the 1990s.”Yet the party’s promotion of the nuclear family is often at odds with the reality of leading women in the AfD. Weidel, for example, is a gay woman bringing up two children with her partner.With just four months to go until European elections that will pick a parliament to sit until 2024, the female vote will be crucial to the success of rightwing populists seeking to build on the 50-odd MEPs they have in the 751-seat chamber.Le Pen’s party, currently polling level with Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche, hopes to harness the fury unleashed by the gilets jaunes movement – and court the high number of working-class women who have taken to the streets. These include single mothers and working mothers on low incomes. In Italy, Meloni, has already been savvier at appealing to other women. “She attracts more women as she seems to be the only one making the battle for women,” says Letizia Giorgianni, who voted for the party last year.Esther Lehnert, a rightwing-populism expert from Berlin’s Alice Salomon University, says the party remains “steeped in chauvinism and sexism. It revels in this sort of leery sexist blokeism.” She recalls some of the AfD’s more controversial election posters, including one showing five naked female behinds, accompanied by the slogan: “For ersity”.Hochst Höchst is trying to change things. “People are repeatedly asking me why the AfD wants women to go back to the hearth,” says the single mother of four. “It’s simply not true. What we do advocate is that women should have the choice to stay at home if they want to, or to work.”The newly founded group FridA, or Frauen in der AfD (Women in the AfD), formed in early November, is Höchst’s answer to the charge that the party has not so far done enough to make itself welcoming to female newcomers. “Before I joined the party, there were countless times I was shopping at the market in my hometown and I didn’t approach the AfD information point, because there were only men there. As soon as there were women, I approached them instinctively,” she says.Lehnert says the future of the party may depend on whether it increases female support. “On a certain level, many people in the AfD recognise that they have to change and attract more women if they’re to have a chance to become an established ‘people’s party’. At the same time, I believe that these chauvinistic habits are so deep-set that I can’t see them arranging themselves differently. Typically, when women start to take up too much space in rightwing populist parties, they will at some point be put back in their place.”Both Miazga and Höchst see themselves as tough-skinned lone warriors, who regularly work 18 hour days. Both have received threats, with Höchst saying that her house is often smeared with offensive graffiti. Both were once top sportswomen and argue this has helped them to succeed in the AfD. “I could kill every man in the party,” said Höchst, who practices karate. But, she adds quickly: “Of course, I don’t want to.”Miazga’s favourite phrase when talking about the male-female ide in the party is to joke: “It takes just 10 of us to keep the 82 men in check”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592ce3410ad68722f991e24824b4d2ececc61675/0_172_2878_1726/master/2878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47632575e6b629b4da59e3934fafffa3","title":"sedivackuv long sled dog race 2019 in pictures","story":"Only half of the 100 ‘mushers’ who braved one of Europe’s toughest sled dog races, the Czech long trail, finished the competition, which was hit by severe weather"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66a26e86630eb06b32c72306782b415462bb0d8/0_247_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52ebe18a58077286f82b4c8a1d91aa53","title":"rawlins trustpilot review refund","story":"I have been offered a “bribe” by Rawlins Paints to change my recent poor, one-star Trustpilot review.

Meanwhile, the Conservative Graham Brady is testing support for the prime minister’s deal if she were to get concessions on the Irish backstop.  At the centre of it all sits the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. He alone chooses which amendments will be selected for debate and who gets to speak. And in recent weeks he has used his powers to break with precedent, infuriating pro-Brexit MPs.  Joining Anushka Asthana to discuss it all is the ’s Patrick Wintour, who has been covering politics and parliament for more than 30 years.  Also today, in opinion, the columnist Jonathan Freedland on the Brexit-backing elite and how they are protecting themselves from the worst consequences of leaving the EU.

That will mean reopening the withdrawal agreement.”He said she had told ministers the amendment “sets out in no uncertain terms our continued commitment to arrangements which avoid a hard border”, and “gives us scope for a new discussion with the EU about how best we achieve that”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the backbench European Research Group, and the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, had both demanded a clear statement from May that she was willing to reopen the fraught issue of the backstop.“We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country,” Johnson said.The prime minister is expected to hold calls with EU leaders later on Tuesday, to clear the way for another round of negotiations.She will tell MPs the government hopes to bring back a deal to parliament, to secure the support of MPs in another “meaningful vote”, as soon as possible.But if no deal has been reached by 13 February, the spokesman said May would table a statement setting out what the government plans to do next – which MPs will be able to amend, giving them another opportunity to reject a no-deal Brexit.“There are two weeks ahead of us, and if after that the government doesn’t have a deal to bring before the house, there will be another vote,” the spokesman said.Senior Conservatives anxious that the government is drifting towards a no-deal Brexit, including the business minister Richard Harrington, had demanded that May set a two-week deadline for securing a settlement.The spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister supported the so-called “Malthouse compromise” – a proposal thrashed out by the housing minister Kit Malthouse together with both Brexit and remain-backing MPs.But he said the cabinet had welcomed the fact that Brexiters and remainers were working together. “We welcome the fact that MPs are working together to come up with solutions, and we will continue to engage with that process”.Downing Street also reiterated the government’s objections to a separate amendment, tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and former Conservative minister Nick Boles, paving the way for an extension of Article 50.“The practical consequences of the amendment would not be to rule out no deal but to delay Brexit,” the spokesman said, adding that it offered “absolutely no positive suggestions” about how to resolve the impasse in parliament.Labour announced on Tuesday that it would whip its MPs to support the Cooper-Boles amendment, despite fears among some frontbenchers that voters would regard it as a bid to thwart Brexit.A Labour source said, “we’re backing the Cooper amendment to reduce the threat of the chaos of a no deal exit. The Cooper Bill could give MPs a temporary window to agree a deal that can bring the country together,” adding, “we will aim to amend the Cooper Bill to shorten the possible Article 50 extension”.Labour believes the nine-month period suggested by Cooper and colleagues is too long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/753e23d11fcae3048dd2c4294d1244a332236577/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ace62a17e635e56d89b1dab3c2aaae57","title":"brexit tories unite to back compromise giving theresa may extra time transition period","story":"Brussels sceptical about Irish border proposal backed by Brexiters and remainersA plan from rival Conservative factions aimed at securing a breakthrough in the Brexit impasse has been greeted with immediate scepticism from EU officials, who said the proposals were not workable.Senior Tory Brexit supporters including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker hatched the plan with leading remainers including Nicky Morgan and Stephen Hammond.The proposal involves paying the £39bn EU orce bill, redrafting the backstop arrangements over the Irish border and extending the implementation period until December 2021.The extra time would be used to try to agree a free-trade deal, while citizens’ rights would be guaranteed. In that period, there would be no customs checks on the Irish border. The initiative has been called the “Malthouse compromise” after the housing minister Kit Malthouse, who entreated the two warring factions to attempt talks.EU officials dismissed the suggested compromise, which they said failed to offer Ireland any reassurance on the avoidance of a hard border.Brussels sources pointed out the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, had said technology to avoid a hard border does not exist. “What a cunning plan,” laughed one official. “This is just nonsense,” echoed an EU diplomat.Brexit-backing MPs, including Rees-Mogg, were still seeking fresh reassurances from the prime minister before they vote for a government-backed amendment on the backstop on Tuesday evening, which could pave the way for the new plan to be put to Brussels.Rees-Mogg told journalists on Tuesday morning he would wait and see whether the government interpreted the amendment, tabled by the senior MP Graham Brady, as an instruction to try to reopen the 585-page withdrawal agreement.“Let’s see what the prime minister says at the dispatch box today and what the Brady amendment really means,” he said.Theresa May is expected to open the debate for the government, allowing her to set out her next steps for MPs. She faces conflicting pressures from rival wings of her party.As well as Rees-Mogg’s demands for a pledge to rework the backstop, pro-soft Brexit ministers are demanding a clear commitment that she will hold another vote to allow MPs to reject no deal, if attempts at renegotiation fail.The business minister Richard Harrington told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday he and colleagues were demanding a promise from the prime minister that she would secure her plan B within a fortnight – or give them another chance to reject no deal.“If she is prepared to give that irrevocable undertaking – which means at the dispatch box or a similar instrument – many of us feel, ‘Well, OK for the sake of everything, we will give her two weeks.’ But that is it.”Iain Duncan Smith, the Eurosceptic former Conservative leader, told Today the plan represented “the best hope that we’ve got” and urged the government to get behind it.The DUP said later it would also back the Malthouse plan. In a statement, the party leader, Arlene Foster, said the proposal “can unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of remainers and leavers”.She said: “If the prime minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on.”Should the hunt for a solution involving technology fail, the so-called safety net proposed by the Tory MPs would involve the EU agreeing to a three-year transition period without there being any agreement on a backstop. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has repeatedly said it is “certain” that without the legally operable backstop, there will be no transition period for the British economy after 29 March.A spokesman for the European commission declined to comment on the proposals emanating from Westminster.He said: “This is not a Brussels day, this is a London day. Let’s have the vote and we will see.”Morgan confirmed the proposal had been reached after days of discussion coordinated by Malthouse.“The prime minister has been aware of the discussions. At some point, there has to be compromise on all sides in order to get a deal over the line,” she said.Setting out the detail of the “Malthouse compromise”, Morgan said: “The first part of it is to recast the backstop as a sort of free-trade-agreement-lite. That would involve a commitment by all sides to have no hard border on the island of Ireland, but allow trade to continue, while there is a slightly longer implementation period till December 2021.”In return, Brexit supporters have agreed to drop their demand that the £39bn orce settlement be withheld, she said.The remain-supporting MP characterised the proposals as “the withdrawal agreement we have got at the moment with changes to the backstop”.“People like me want to avoid a no-deal outcome and we have to look for ways to do that, and we are all prepared to compromise on that,” she said.Steve Baker, one of the leaders of the hard-Brexit European Research Group, tweeted his backing for the proposals.The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, gave only muted backing to the idea. “There are all sort of ideas being put out, but parliament can’t take a decision unless that is on the order paper, and it is not on the order paper today,” he told Today.“The government is open to listening to all ideas. It is time that we actually made progress. Voters want parliament to make a decision.”It is still unclear whether the prime minister is prepared to pursue the offer of compromise.Some Conservative MPs rejected the plan, with “people’s vote” supporter Anna Soubry saying it was “a recipe for no-deal Brexit”.“The prospect of the EU ripping up the withdrawal agreement or allowing a transition period without the backstop is very remote – and for good reason given the risks to the Irish peace process. Instead, this scheme backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg is a recipe for the no-deal Brexit that the hard Brexiters have always craved.“We cannot allow our economy, vital public services and life chances of young people to be sacrificed for a last-minute gesture towards Conservative party unity,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8117bd07cd9e044e4c720caf0891a7744ad61a1/184_293_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755d07b4d67918764248b2e755a840ee","title":"the malthouse compromise everything you need to know brexit vote","story":"Full details of the overnight plan that has won the backing of key Brexiters and remainersA compromise Brexit plan has emerged overnight in Westminster with the backing of heavyweight Tory Brexiters and remainers, including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nicky Morgan.Two factions have thrown their weight behind the unexpected new compromise plan, backed by several ministers, which would involve a redrafting of the backstop and an extension of the transition period until 2021.However, it is still unclear whether the prime minister is prepared to pursue the offer of compromise, while elements of the plan have been met with deep scepticism from some MPs and the EU.Here is a look at the details of the proposal:The plan is based on a protocol drafted by the former Brexit minister Steve Baker but the initiative has been called the “Malthouse compromise”, after the housing minister Kit Malthouse, who entreated the two warring factions to attempt talks.MPs have been meeting in secret over the past few days to try to agree a plan both sides could support. Other ministers involved in discussing the plan include the health secretary, Stephen Hammond, and the solicitor general, Robert Buckland.In a WhatsApp message to Conservative MPs, Morgan said the plan “provides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship. It ensures there is no need for a hard border with Ireland.”In basic terms, the prime minister would renegotiate the backstop element of her Brexit deal to replace it with a free trade agreement with as-yet-unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.It would also involve extending the transition period for an extra year until December 2021 to allow more time to agree a new trading relationship.The “new backstop” is based on a plan drafted by the former Brexit minister Steve Baker before Christmas, which he has named “A Better Deal”.It has its roots in the Brexiters’ preferred solution to the Irish border that was discussed by the cabinet last spring – the maximum facilitation model, nicknamed “max fac”. New technology and streamlined customs such as trusted trader schemes and numberplate recognition would replace checks that would be needed on the Northern Irish border.Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, said an agreement like that would be possible under the current terms of the backstop.“The EU has said they will consider technical fixes as part of the means of replacing the backstop. But the issue is that lots of this is untried and untested,” he said. “We don’t know if it would alleviate the need for physical infrastructure so it cannot, in itself, work as an alternative backstop. The whole point of the backstop is that it would work under any circumstances.”If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise offers a plan B – essentially a managed no-deal. Many soft Brexit and pro-remain MPs are firmly against this as an alternative – leading to some private confusion as to why this has been accepted by MPs such as Morgan and Hammond.Under this plan, the PM would ask the EU to honour the agreed Brexit transition period, extended for one year, in return for the UK honouring its agreed financial contributions and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for a departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 — or to negotiate a different deal.Theresa May has been made aware of the discussions over the past few days and cabinet ministers will discuss it on Tuesday morning. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, reacted coolly to the prospect of a compromise agreement on Tuesday morning.“There are all sorts of ideas being put out, but parliament cannot take a decision unless it is on the order paper, and it is not on the order paper,” he told the Today programme. “We have had a long time to get to today. It is time that we actually made progress. It is getting close to 29 March. Voters want parliament to make a decision.”There was an enthusiastic reception to the plan on the Tory MP WhatsApp group on Monday night after the plan leaked. Boris Johnson called it a “breakthrough”, and the health minister Steve Brine messaged the group saying: “Promising. Let’s just do this and move on.” Minister Thérèse Coffey also sent some enthusiastic emojis.Pro-remain Tory MPs have expressed deep scepticism, however. Anna Soubry, who backs the “people’s vote” campaign for a second referendum, said: “We understand why MPs desperately concerned about crashing out of the EU are considering desperate measures but this latest proposal only heightens the risk of a no-deal outcome. This scheme backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg is a recipe for the no-deal Brexit that the hard Brexiters have always craved.”On Tuesday, Brussels sources pointed out the EU’s deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, had said technology to avoid a hard border does not exist.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has already been emphatic that there can be no such thing as a managed no deal. “Without an operational backstop, there will not be an accord and there will not be a transition period,” he said.Ireland’s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, called for “realism” from the UK, saying the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated. She said: “There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64551ea31b59ce89b9f531e1d0b4d1af6bf37a4/0_140_5140_3085/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=847e14f012874f2637b7abd447a9b540","title":"brexit vote commons latest news developments liam fox says may now saying withdrawal deal text must be rewritten politics live","story":"Theresa May says she will reopen Brexit withdrawal agreement with EU ahead of probable votes on anti-backstop and Article 50 amendmentsFiona Onasanya MP has been given a three-month jail sentence for lying to avoid a speeding ticket, automatically triggering a recall petition in her Cambridgeshire seat, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. Onasanya was a Labour MP until she was expelled from the party following her conviction.That is probably one less vote for Yvette Cooper tonight. Onasanya had been voting in the Commons following her expulsion from Labour, and in the vote on the government’s Brexit plan earlier this month, she voted with the opposition against.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has told journalists that backing the Cooper amendment is a “fallback” position for Labour.The issue is how long an extension could be and the general view is as short as possible. But it is literally just a fallback in case there is no deal agreed.He suggested that Labour favoured a three-month extension to article 50 if there is no Brexit deal by 26 February, not the nine-month extension proposed in the Cooper bill. He said:I think the general view is nine months would be too long. If there is to be time to negotiate a deal it would be much shorter than that.The Cooper amendment (here, amendment b, on page 11) is not the same as the Cooper bill (pdf). The amendment just allows time for the bill to be debated on in the Commons on Tuesday 5 February (ie, a week today).Here is Theresa May leaving Number 10 a few minute ago on her way to the Commons to open the Brexit debate.The People’s Vote campaign has released a thorough briefing explaining why it thinks the “Malthouse compromise” won’t work. The full briefing is here, and here are the key points.These proposals are not new – they have been roundly and repeatedly rejected by the EU. It is a recipe for the no deal Brexit that the extremists have always craved.‘Plan A’ involves an alternative backstop proposal that was tried by the government and rejected. And ‘Plan B’ assumes the EU would agree to a transition period without a withdrawal agreement – something it has also firmly rejected.Even if the proposals were remotely workable, they would be disastrous for our country. It would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland, threaten jobs and key industries, alienate our allies, and serve only as a basis for the dangerous economic plans favoured by hardline Brexiters.We cannot allow our economy, vital public services and life chances of young people to be sacrificed for a last-minute gesture towards Conservative party unity.And this is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.These are from ITV’s Robert Peston.Theresa May told cabinet that she is ready to reopen the withdrawal agreement to seek legally-binding changes to the backstop, in the hope of winning the support of Parliament for her Brexit deal, her spokesman told journalists at the lunchtime lobby briefing. This confirms what Number 10 was saying yesterday, and Liam Fox was saying this morning.The PA account of the briefing goes on:May told the weekly meeting of senior ministers in Downing Street that she will open this afternoon’s Brexit debate in the Commons with a statement explaining why she is backing Sir Graham Brady’s amendment as a means to achieving this goal.Her official spokesman said she aims to return to the Commons “as soon as possible” with a revised deal which will be subject to a “meaningful vote” by MPs. If this is rejected by MPs, she will table a further amendable motion for debate the next day. If no new deal has been reached with the EU by February 13, May will make a statement to the House that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.This final point, about MPs having the chance to have another Brexit debate and vote on Thursday 14 February, should be enough to stop Richard Harrington resigning this afternoon as business minister. (See 9.31am.)In an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents the most hardline Tory Brexiters, provided this explanation of how the “Malthouse compromise” would work. It is easier to follow than the chart distributed to Tory MPs last night. (See 10.07am.)What we need to do is have a plan A and a plan B. So the plan A is to rescue the withdrawal agreement. The key feature of the withdrawal agreement that we cannot deal with is this idea of being permanently trapped as a satellite of the European Union within the backstop ....So we rescue the withdrawal agreement by taking out the backstop, and replacing it with a better backstop which we can live with indefinitely. So it’s based on a free trade area in agrifood and goods, and it means there would be unlimited trade with no tariffs between the UK and Europe including Ireland. Lots of trade facilitiations to make sure there are no checks on the border. And we believe that that is a practical pragmatic way forward with current rules ....Plan B is about putting a triple safety net around exiting without an agreement. So the first safety net is that we continue to offer Plan A. The second safety net is that we offer to purchase the implementation period that’s been offered, so that we would have a standstill until no later than December 2021. That’s later than some would like, but it’s earlier than potentially it could run to today. So this is the nature of compromise. We would reduce our financial offer to the minimum compatible with international law obligations.A simpler way of explaining it would be an attempt to have the transition period without the backstop, with an extra one year bolted on to the transition as a concession to the EU and to remainers ....This is from Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury.British nationals who have retired to EU countries including Spain and France will no longer have their health care covered by the NHS in the event of no deal, the government has confirmed. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has the full story here.Labour has confirmed that it will back the Yvette Cooper amendment, which would create time to allow MPs to pass a bill that would oblige Theresa May to ask for an extension of article 50 if no Brexit deal has been agreed by 26 February, the party has announced. A party source said:We’re backing the Cooper amendment to reduce the threat of the chaos of a no deal exit. The Cooper bill could give MPs a temporary window to agree a deal that can bring the country together. We will aim to amend the Cooper bill to shorten the possible article 50 extension.That is because the Cooper bill would oblige the PM to seek an extension of article 50 until the end of 2019. Many in the Labour leadership would prefer a three-month extension rather than a nine-month one.With Labour now officially backing the Cooper amendment, it will have a very good chance of passing.Here is more on the “Malthouse compromise”.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, told the  it was met with “cautious interest” at cabinet, the ’s Anna Mikhailova reports.The FT’s Laura Hughes says at least one minister thinks Number 10 will back it.The Sunday Times’ Tim Shipman says, if May were to back it, Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group would back the Brady amendment.But the Economist’s John Peet thinks it won’t work.But the DUP (never ones to be put off by warnings about Brexit proposals being unrealistic) have endorsed the “Malthouse compromise”. (See 10.07am and 11.58am.) This is from the DUP leader Arlene Foster.The DUP parliamentary group met this morning and discussed the ‘Malthouse’ alternative proposals for the draft withdrawal agreement. The DUP has given its endorsement to the plan. We believe it can unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of remainers and leavers. It also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union which would split the United Kingdom or keep the entire United Kingdom in the customs union and single market. Importantly, this proposal would also offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. If the prime minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on. There is no better time to advance this alternative given the confusion and disarray which is now manifesting itself in Brussels. This has been displayed both by the contradictory EU statements and the panic stricken behaviour of the Irish government.David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, has written an article for the  explaining why he thinks the new Tory Brexit plan, or the Malthouse compromise as some are calling it, is a non-starter.There is a mistaken belief that the PM will be strengthened by a unified Conservative party position. However such a position has to be realistic, and one that directly attacks the most fundamental red line of the European commission is not. It is almost as if the commission suggested the UK abandoned its commitment to end freedom of movement. On the contrary, this compromise is likely to infuriate the EU and member states, who will see in it a continued failure of the UK to grapple with the choices brought by Brexit, and a rerun of ideas already rejected.And here is the article.These are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on cabinet.Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary, has said what assurances he would like to hear from the PM later. His position is much the same as the DUP’s. (See 10.20am.)Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has already said May will be demanding actual changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement from the EU. (See 9.31am.) But presumably Johnson wants to hear this from May herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bbf3a7d80afcc5feb78833ae7fb5dc9a8952bbe/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f3ef3a2a4cec3af9895179b1bb6406","title":"forget the gym five ways to get fit for free","story":"Exercise doesn’t have to be expensive.

Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas.

The other will be played in one of the sport’s heartlands, Leeds, at Elland Road.Anfield will host both the stand-out quarter-final and the opening ceremony for the women’s tournament, while Newcastle’s St James’ Park will stage the opening ceremony for the men’s edition, as well as England’s opening group game. Other venues outside the heartlands, including Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium and Coventry’s Ricoh Arena, will also host games in the men’s tournament.“I would like to congratulate all of our chosen hosts who have worked so hard in submitting such compelling bids,” the chief executive of the 2021 World Cup, Jon Dutton, said. “Each and every host now has the opportunity to galvanise and inspire their respective communities ahead of the competing nations arriving in England.“This was an incredibly tough process, given the large number of interested parties and the impressive nature of their bids. With so many competitive bids we’re confident that our chosen hosts will help play a role in delivering the greatest, and most inclusive, Rugby League World Cup of all time.”“The UK is renowned for putting on some of the biggest and best sporting events in the world and the Rugby League World Cup 2021 will be no exception,” said Mims Davies, the Minister for Sport and Civil Society. “This tournament will provide a stage for the world’s best players in the men’s, women’s and wheelchair game to shine in cities and towns across the country.

The play, Bitter Wheat, will have its world premiere in London this summer.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, Malkovich described the play as “a black farce about a very badly behaved movie mogul”. The actor said “a lot of people may not like” the play but that he felt it was “a terrific piece of writing”. Asked how comedy could be used to respond to the serious nature of the scandal – which includes allegations of rape, harassment and sexual assault, all of which Weinstein has denied – Malkovich said: “A lot of great plays elicit the question: do I laugh or do I cry? I think a lot of great comedy exists at the crossroads between pain and farce.”In promotional material, Malkovich’s character, Barney Fein, is described as “a bloated monster – a studio head who, like his predecessor, the minotaur, devours the young he has lured into his cave”. Bitter Wheat is “written and directed by David Mamet in a good mood” and “rips the pashmina off the suppurating wound which is show business, and leaves us better human beings, and fitter to once more confront the horror of life”.Asked if Barney Fein is supposed to directly represent Weinstein, Malkovich said: “No, it’s not particularly Harvey Weinstein. It’s a great deal about that business and a great deal about about how people in that business in positions, say, as studio heads have behaved really for more or less a century now. If the idea maybe started as a reaction to all the news that came out in particular about Harvey Weinstein, I think David took the idea from there and went with it.”Bitter Wheat is Mamet’s first new play since China Doll, which opened on Broadway in 2015 and starred Al Pacino. Malkovich will be joined on stage by Doon Mackichan, who will play Fein’s assistant, Sondra, and by Ioanna Kimbook in her debut theatre performance. The rest of the cast for the production, which Mamet will direct himself, has not yet been announced. The play will be at the Garrick theatre, London, from 7 June to 14 September.Next month, Steven Berkoff will direct himself in Harvey, a one-man show he has written about Weinstein, at the Playground theatre, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb 700w","title":"power mentors the community activists inspiring young londoners","story":"Anyone’s surroundings can inspire them to change their life – you just have to be willing to see the world with fresh eyes. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we meet a new breed of activists, such as ex-gang member Karl Lokko, who demonstrate just how important this is. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3When Karl Lokko was 12 years old, his life took its first swerve towards danger. He saw someone shot for the first time, on Brixton’s Myatts Field estate, the south London housing block he called home. For years, the estate had earned a reputation as a place where families and children lived in the crossfire of local conflicts. And for a time, it seemed as though Lokko would commit his life to the gang culture that seemed to thrive in his area. Now, though, he considers that estate one of the most meaningful places in his life.“It had a terrible reputation – branded at one point by the press as the ‘Devil’s Den’,” he says. Even then, it was still the backdrop for the childhood games he remembers playing with friends: “Knock down ginger, 4040 home, run outs and park-swing Olympics.” It’s also where Lokko met Pastor Mimi Asher as a young adult – the woman who would eventually turn his life around.And that’s where Lokko’s story leaps from the everyday into the extraordinary. He didn’t follow a route carved out for him, leading away from school and into life on the streets. Instead, the 28-year-old found himself – and a new focus – as close to home as the gangland distractions. He’s grown into one of several inspiring Londoners who’ve used their combination of experience and personal knowledge to turn well-known spaces and activities into life-changing sites of positive change.In Lokko’s case, that came down to how Asher refocused his energy, leading him to a very different life. As in giving TEDx Talks, striking up a friendship with Prince Harry and working as a charity ambassador. By grabbing his life by the lapels and steering it in a new direction, the poet, activist and influencer has matured into someone who’s able to see the mundane in a new light. Lokko credits Pastor Asher for nudging him away from criminality. She would open her flat on the estate to him and other vulnerable young men. And inside, she ran a Christian faith group, which she described to the  as being less about God and scripture and more “about helping to give young men identity, value and something to believe in”.Other innovators similarly use their surroundings as a springboard for community work and making a positive impact. Fellow poet Momtaza Mehri takes inspiration from her London upbringing and Somali heritage to write forceful works that vibrate with the capital’s energy. As this year’s young people’s laureate for London, she tackles everything from gentrification to race, street violence and the living, breathing history of her city. Mehri says her writing is invested in “questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces”.Elsewhere in the city, Tanya Compas and Charlie Dark work in separate disciplines but both help their communities see themselves in newly affirming ways. Compas is a youth worker, who – through workshops, events and education – empowers young women of colour to see their worth. She’s won several awards, and is one of the Evening Standard’s 1,000 most influential Londoners. Dark founded Run Dem Crew, a running group that began to help inspire young men of colour that has now turned into a city-wide phenomenon in London.Finally, groups such as Muslim Girls Fence – using the sport of fencing to break down stereotypes about Muslim women – and the Big House, bringing isolated care leavers into theatre production, show what can happen when collectives help amplify marginalised voices. As Sarah Saaed, a teenage Muslim Girls Fence mentor put it, the programme “gives me power. It makes me feel like I have strength and I am powerful, and I’m strong and resilient.” Both programmes excel at allowing their participants to see themselves anew.As for Lokko, he’s developed his poetry and songwriting around the city since Asher demonstrated how Myatts Field estate and the wider community could provide inspiration rather than stir up fear. Take the underground, for example: specifically, the Victoria line’s southernmost stop. “As a Brixton boy, any commute across the city started from this point. But what became apparent to me after a while is that poetry was always a by-product on these trips,” says Lokko.And so he wrote the majority of his first poetry collection, The Butterfly Effect, zooming along in tube carriages, he says. “The underground was where people made contact but rarely connected. The British reserve gave way for silence on crowded carriages that would usher, for me, creativity.” Anyone’s surroundings can turn into sites for new potential – you just have to be willing to see your world with fresh eyes.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835c3800cf2e75604ffc5bc284a8eaa9d7976714/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10948cdc97342cb1ae66b05e2fb4c782","title":"from buffy to boardwalk empire your favourite boxsets ever","story":"Vampire slayers, bootleggers, polygamists and the most evil villain since Satan ... readers respond to our critics’ list with more brilliant binge-worthy TV we missedI’m surprised by the omission of this. At a superficial level it is stunning, violent entertainment, but its study of how the development of apparently intelligent robots could dehumanise their creators makes it a philosophical speculative fiction of the highest order. LostsockUnjustly ended up playing second-fiddle in HBO’s schedule to Game of Thrones, but for me, Boardwalk Empire iswas one of the greatest shows of all time and well worth a binge-watch, truncated fifth season and all. I’d go as far as to say that this and the respective first series of anthology shows Fargo and True Detective have been the last “prestige” television that can hold a candle to programmes like the Sopranos or the Wire. SDSHEPPSeriously, some love for Fargo is needed. Who else cuts from blood, snow and forest to angelic intervention in a bowling alley? Who else provides such sublime soundtracks, subtle characterisation and exquisite photography? Who else details the shift in crime from gangsters to corporate, who discusses the nature of truth and reality, who gives us Obadiah, Camus and Peter and the Wolf? The only TV I have seen that helps find meaning in a disorienting world. CookyhunterThe article left out my vote for one of the best ever: Deadwood. Ian McShane as Al Swearingen gives us the most evil villain since Satan. The rest of the cast is peppered with expertly played misfits, perverts, eccentrics and even decent people. The language is over the top, but you get used to it. Marty WolfA fantastic multilayered French police and justice system drama. Combining soap-like story arcs with political intrigue, comedy, psychodrama and cliffhangers, it cast a forensic eye over the French system of law and politics and class and race and sex and morality. Brilliant. scausmausFor science fiction fans, add the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. It holds up pretty well on rewatching, although you can see the strain between Ron Moore and Sci-Fi Channel, as it was then, all the more with the passage of time, from the weak “standalone” episodes in season three (Sci-Fi wanted more of those) to the rushed last season (it was supposed to run five seasons, but Sci-Fi would only commit to one more after series three, so Moore cut parts out.) Craig DeBlockMy absolute favourite. Yes, a few poor episodes and sub-plots, but all in all it was brilliant. Coming from a North American evangelical childhood (I’m now humanist) made it all the more enthralling. Bill Paxton, Chloë Sevigny, Jeanne Tripplehorn and so many more great performances. ID0286463Buffy should be in there, especially as unlike many listed here it gets better as it goes on. Tough it through series one, and series two onwards will delight you. manetrancedMy favourite ever TV series is Heimat, set mainly in a German village close to the French border. The first two series take in from the end of the first world war to the late 60s. The third series covered reunification and is not quite so good although still wonderful. It is on Netflix. EclecticalBrilliant throughout and can thoroughly recommend. Great character development, insanely funny at times and a loving and well researched look at historical themes, memes and fashions from 60s and 70s America. Very entertaining stuff. EllieArrowayWhere on earth is the Shield on this list? Characters, plots, subplots and twists on a Shakespearean level, with the quality of the likes of Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker coming in to add further lustre to a cast that was on point the whole way through. Glorious. gmancThe American version of The Office is just so much better than the original: I can’t believe it didn’t get a mention. Yes, Ricky Gervais came up with the original concept, but Steve Carrell knocked the socks off him with depth of character and humour. After a couple of episodes of the original you just want to punch David Brent quite hard and turn it off. Addie21I came across this late last year and watched it to the end of season three in only a few days, despite an effort to slow down and extend the pleasure. Then my husband and I watched it together, again a “box-set” binge-experience. He enjoyed it so much that we watched the first eight episodes in one day.

These pampered new islanders don’t know they’re born Reality TV tends to inspire outrage consider the Ofcom complaints generated by Dani Dyer’s “emotional abuse” at the hands of Love Island producers, or the bile directed at Strictly’s Alexandra Burke for being more talented than Middle England felt she had any business being.Shipwrecked, the Channel 4 show in which two islands compete for a cash prize, belongs to a gentler time – one before the watershed moment when Geordie Shore’s Charlotte Crosby was shown simultaneously having sex, farting and wetting the bed. So why did I feel rising indignation while watching the show’s latest reboot? It wasn’t the candid discussion of “doing bits” which began to boil my blood, but the appearance of a pre-assembled, watertight hut. I just about held it together as the new islanders were shown discovering a covered toilet and spacious kitchen, before losing it entirely as they flaunted their … hang on, was that – A SHOWER?I should explain. As a teenager, I was a contestant on the original Shipwrecked. Back then, it was a kind of prototype Love Island as imagined by Bear Grylls, in which young cast went to war with the elements while getting off with each other. For five harrowing months, we subsisted on a diet of rice and tongues (lambs’, cows’ and each others’ – thanks to many mandatory games of spin the bottle).Rations were scarce, in the hope that we might learn to fend for ourselves. But after a few unsuccessful attempts at spearing fish with sticks, most of us settled for getting very, very thin. Occasionally we would distract producers by staging elaborate arguments so that one of us could raid the abandoned crew camp for Crunchies, but despite these heroic efforts, one islander lost five stone. Others attempted to stave off rickets by prising sea snails off rocks and eating them raw.Our attempts at building were similarly pitiful, but, in fairness, have you ever tried to build a weatherproof roof out of leaves? I would not recommend it. Eventually I defected from our flooded, dirt-floored shack to sleep on the other side of the island, where at least the wind allowed you to dry your sleeping bag off between rainstorms. I stopped sleeping alone when we discovered human bones and were told that our island was a former leper colony. In a crowded field, residual leprosy wasn’t even the least glamorous element. That would have been our longdrop – an open-air, urine-soaked wooden box – the contents of which piled ever higher until, sitting on it, you could feel the heat generated by a heaving mound of maggots below.The fact that most of the hairy elements were never shown – “it doesn’t rain on TV” was a common refrain from producers – made our suffering feel arbitrary. If our misery wasn’t even providing entertainment, what was the point? Perhaps it was this that led the new series to eschew any survival element in favour of focusing on fighting and flirting. After all, I learned the hard way that you never feel sexy while suffering from “crotch rot” (an affliction several of us developed from dressing exclusively in wet swimming costumes for months on end). The current format has also reduced the time that contestants are shipwrecked from five months to seven weeks, and has allowed luxuries like moisturiser and mosquito nets, whereas we made sport of counting our infected bites and were instructed to wash with – I wish I was joking – sand.I’m partly jealous that the new recruits will live in paradise without the added complications of sleep exhaustion and skin disease, but then again, our version of the show was very character-forming. I, for one, developed several cute personality quirks – such as my inability to see a tin of lamb tongues without sobbing uncontrollably, or hear a friend’s suggestion of “camping” without lashing out indiscriminately. Sure, the new recruits may luxuriate in conditions we could only have dreamed of, but maybe they have been robbed of our more authentic experience. Perhaps Shipwrecked was never really about the winning, or even the taking part, but the nervous tics we developed along the way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/652a2438eed5febe52c027d50f2cab0ed39d9606/0_149_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2720ffe9053f0cb57429bd1cb55d9c12","title":"california hotel workers strike sheraton hilton anaheim","story":"Nearly 1,000 workers at Anaheim’s Sheraton Park and Hilton poised to walk off the job following protests across the US in 2018After 18 years working a housekeeper at the Sheraton Park resort in Anaheim, California, Celia Hernandez still struggles to make ends meet.“I live three blocks from Disneyland. I live in a two-bedroom apartment. I pay $1,875 a month in rent. My 23-year-old son is forced to live in the living room on the couch because we can’t afford a bigger place because the cost of living is so high,” Hernandez said. “It’s a struggle for someone like me to put food on the table for my family.”But Hernandez is now taking action. She is one of nearly 1,000 hotel workers at the Sheraton Park resort and Hilton hotel in Anaheim who are on the verge of walking off the job, continuing a wave of hotel strikes that occurred at the end of 2018 across the US.In September 2018, 6,000 union members went on strike against 26 hotels in Chicago. Nearly 8,000 Marriott hotel workers went on strike in eight US cities for nine weeks in October 2018, the largest hotel strike in US history. Hotel workers in the Los Angeles area were poised to join the wave of hotel strikes after union members at 24 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange county voted to authorize a strike in December 2018.Though several Los Angeles hotels later reached contract deals to avoid a strike, the Sheraton Park resort and Hilton are holding out in negotiations, demanding concessions. Unite Here Local 11, which represents about 1,000 workers at both hotels, said workers are “now on the brink of walking off the job”.Among concerns from hotel workers are the small wage increases being offered by the hotels in contract negotiations, as well as risks due to reduce health coverage.“If they raise the price of the medical insurance, people won’t be able to afford it any more,” Hernandez said. “A week ago I had a biopsy on one of my breasts. If I didn’t have affordable health insurance, I can’t imagine how much money I would have paid out of pocket for that.”Lorena Osegueda has worked at the Sheraton Park resort as a hostess for 12 years and struggles on her current wages and with the cost of health insurance. “A mother of three with the income I’m getting, I’m living paycheck to paycheck, and it’s very hard for me to pay for the insurance as it is,” said Osegueda. “We’re living in a two-bedroom apartment for $1,600 plus bills on top, let alone other things that come up – food, and other things.”The hotels have stood firm to demand concessions from the union. Unite Here Local 11’s organizing director in Orange county, Austin Lynch, noted cooks and stewards are being asked to work four-hour shifts, after they have historically relied on eight-hour shifts. They plan on opening a non-union restaurant in the hotel lobby to compete with the unionized restaurant operated by the hotel, and remain one of the few unionized hotels to refuse to offer their employees a pension. The Hilton is also pushing to enact a program to incentivize guests to reject room cleaning, which would result in layoffs or a reduction in hours for current housekeepers, as well as an increase their workload.“Both hotels are offering very little money, not enough for the workers to take a significant step forward in their wages or pension. Right now the cost of living is surging and the hotels have been doing fabulously, they don’t deny that,” said Lynch. “Workers can’t get small wage increases or no improvement in their pension at a time when hotels are surging and the cost of living is surging.”The union has also accused both hotels of utilizing anti-union tactics, including managers intimidating and interrogating workers and distributing false information about the union negotiations.In a letter sent from the Sheraton Park resort to Unite Here Local 11, the hotel’s general manager wrote: “Union representatives continue to unnecessarily agitate the associates, causing some associates to leave work in tears, and negatively impact the guests who financially support the Hotel and provide our associates with work opportunities.” Marriott referred comment to the hospitality management company that operates the Sheraton Park hotel, Interstate Hotels \u0026amp Resorts.A spokesperson for the hotel told the  in an email: “We are currently in the midst of negotiations with the labor union that represents some of our employees. However, our collective bargaining agreement expired on 30 November 2018. While we continue to negotiate in good faith with the union to achieve a new agreement, we support our associates’ right to decide whether to participate in activities protected by federal labor laws.”A spokesperson for Hilton hotels said in an email: “If the union decides to call a strike, we have contingency plans in place to ensure operations run as smoothly as possible and that we continue to offer the same service and amenities that we are proud to provide our guest and clients every day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0f795f4c4b078363391330b4293fe1c619357da/367_759_3099_1860/master/3099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61072cf8da9cc4b1aac7982300bde506","title":"manilas jeepneys in pictures","story":"Part of the Philippine urban landscape for decades, jeepneys, small buses originally made from military vehicles left by the Americans after the second world war, are being phased out.

Photograph: EPANEIL HALLLeading Conservative Brexiteers and Remainers have produced a joint proposal to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with tariff-free trade and technological measures to keep the Border open.The proposal emerged from secret negotiations between Remainers including former education secretary Nicky Morgan and Brexiteers including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker.It would oblige Theresa May to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement to include an alternative to the backstop based on Brexiteer proposals for “maximum facilitation” of customs and tariff-free trading arrangements. The United Kingdom and the European Union would not be treated as a single customs territory, as they would under the current backstop proposal.Both sides would instead make agree to “specific facilitations and measures to ensure that no physical infrastructure is required in respect of movement of goods across the Irish border”. Customs formalities and inspections would “to the extent possible” be dealt with away from border crossing points.Sources in Dublin were dismissive of the plan, and said it contained no credible alternatives to the backstop.It was also claimed that the plan was merely a repackaging of a plan called “maximum facilitation”, which largely relied on technology to keep the Irish Border open and which was dismissed very early in the Brexit process.Under the proposal, dubbed the Malthouse compromise after Conservative MP Kit Malthouse who hosted the talks, would see Britain pay the £39 billion (€44 billion) orce bill in full and extend the transition period to three years.The second part of the proposal outlines the terms of a “managed no-deal” if Britain and the EU fail to agree a comprehensive trade deal within three years.“The first part of it is to recast the backstop as a sort of free-trade-agreement-lite. That would involve a commitment by all sides to have no hard border on the island of Ireland but allow trade to continue, while there is a slightly longer implementation period till December 2021,” Ms Morgan said.DUP leader Arlene Foster gave her party’s support to the Malthouse compromise. “We believe it can unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of Remainers and Leavers,” she said.“It also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union which would split the United Kingdom or keep the entire United Kingdom in the customs union and single market. Importantly, this proposal would also offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.”The DUP leader said: “There is no better time to advance this alternative given the confusion and disarray which is now manifesting itself in Brussels. This has been displayed both by the contradictory EU statements and the panic-stricken behaviour of the Irish Government.”However, senior EU diplomatic sources dismissed the proposal as “fanciful” and “desperate”, predicting EU leaders would reject it immediately if Mrs May were to present it for negotiation in Brussels.Mrs May has told Conservative MPs that she will seek to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border.The British prime minister urged them to vote on Tuesday for an amendment calling for her Brexit deal to be approved on condition that the backstop is replaced.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has urged Conservative MPs to give Mrs May a “strong mandate” to return to Brussels to negotiate changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop.Ahead of the Commons votes that could help shape the next phase of talks with the EU, Mr Fox said the Mrs May was ready to reopen the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to secure a legally binding text.At a meeting of Tory MPs in Westminster on Monday, Mrs May called on them to get behind an amendment tabled by influential chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady calling for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.Conservative MPs were informed they would be whipped to vote for the amendment — assuming it is selected by Commons speaker John Bercow.Her hopes of gaining a Commons majority for the plan received an initial setback after Mr Rees-Mogg, the leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), said they were not prepared to support it and it did not change anything.However, Mr Rees-Mogg suggested he could be prepared to support it if the amendment had official government backing.Both the EU and the Irish government have been adamant that there can be no question of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee, said: “There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over 18 months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.”In Dublin, the Cabinet was scheduled to discuss further preparations for a no-deal Brexit this morning when Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe was expected to present a memo on its implications.Mr Donohoe and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have ruled out an emergency budget in the event of a no-deal outcome, insisting that the October budget was drawn up with Brexit in mind.But the Central Bank warned last week that a no-deal Brexit would deliver a serious blow to the Irish economy, slashing projected economic growth this year.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The performance was believed lost to history when the tapes were accidentally wiped.Almost half a century on, a recording of that first appearance has been unearthed. A member of the public came forward to say they had captured the show on computer tape, a forerunner of VHS.It is now being restored with the aim of showing it in a forthcoming BBC documentary, David Bowie: Finding Fame.“For fans, it is something of a Holy Grail,” said Francis Whately, the film-maker, in an interview with Radio Times. “It would fall apart if we played it, so it’s had to be very carefully restored. It will be a real coup if it comes off.”The tape has degraded and is being slowly “baked” - incubated at 130 degrees to extract moisture that has built up over the decades and rendered the footage unplayable.Still photographs of the Lift Off appearance do exist, showing Bowie wearing the same Ziggy jumpsuit as he would later wear on Top of the Pops.Bowie performs live at Earls Court Arena on May 12 1973 during the Ziggy Stardust tour He appeared alongside The Spiders from Mars in an episode broadcast on June 15 1972 that also featured Tony Christie, and was preceded by a segment starring an owl puppet called Ollie Beak.The pop show ran from 1969-74 and was hosted by Ayshea Brough. It is said that Granada Television had sent 144 tapes to be transferred to digital, a handful of which were marked with an ‘x’ meaning they could be safely deleted because they featured duplicate content.Instead, a technician misunderstood the instructions and thought only the marked tapes were to be transferred, deleting the rest. While the Top of the Pops performance of Starman lives on in the archive, garnering millions of views online and regularly featuring on television, the song’s television debut has been all but forgotten.In an interview with Record Collector magazine, Brough said: “He wiped years of my life and performances, and everybody else’s performances. It’s a terrible thing.” Brought later moved to the US, where she set up an interior design business.The \u0026#39Starman\u0026#39 costume on display at the V\u0026ampA\u0026#39s David Bowie exhibition in 2013Some musicians do remember the impact of the Lift Off performance. Nick Rhodes, the Duran Duran keyboardist, said in a recent Bowie biography, Dylan Jones’s David Bowie: A Life: “He was a phenomenon, in the same way the Sex Pistols were a few years later. At school the next day, nobody talked about anything else.”“I was absolutely gobsmacked. My gran was shouting insults at the TV, which she usually saved for Labour Party political broadcasts. And I just sat there agog. I was experiencing a life-changing moment. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it really did knock me for six.”The BBC documentary, which will be broadcast next month, is the final part of Whately’s trilogy of films about Bowie. It explores the star’s early years and includes contributions from one of his first girlfriends, actress and model Hermione Farthingale, and a cousin, Kristina Amadeus, who has never spoken publicly about him before.Please review our commenting policyComment: Labour MPs are trying to destroy Brexit – and they don\u0026#39t intend to give up any time soonBrexit vote latest news: Theresa May vows to reopen Withdrawal agreement to change backstopGlobal campaign urges release of Bahraini footballer from Thai jailFiona Onasanya becomes first sitting MP to be jailed in almost 30 years Comment: The Left can\u0026#39t beat the far –Right, only true liberalism canBrexit deal: What time does Parliament vote on Theresa May\u0026#39s Plan B today?What is Article 50?

The pound is 12 per cent lower against the euro at €1.158.“Political uncertainty plays a huge role in the stability of currency and exchange rates, and the last thirty-one months since the referendum has been a prime example of that,” said Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of FairFX.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The head of the parliament, Juan Guaido, declared himself acting president\u0026nbsplast week and he has been recognised as the legitimate interim leader by a number of countries, including the United States. Britain has said it will recognise Guaido as the interim president if fresh elections are not announced shortly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pound is 12 per cent lower against the euro at €1.158.“Political uncertainty plays a huge role in the stability of currency and exchange rates, and the last thirty-one months since the referendum has been a prime example of that,” said Ian Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of FairFX.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She subsequently argued that teachers should not be expected to answer emails or spend hours marking schoolwork after 5pm each day.Morgan also announced plans to launch a new website to make it easier for women to identify potential job-sharing partners.Three years on and not much appears to have changed. Just last week, Hinds said teachers should not be spending their evenings and weekends responding to emails. The minister also revealed proposals to give more support to teachers who want to work part-time and share jobs.If the rhetoric has remained the same since 2014, despite three different education secretaries, at least\u0026nbspnow the government has announced plans to provide more funding to improve retention.Teachers at the start of their career – who are often those who need the most support –\u0026nbspwill be given a training package and a reduced timetable, backed by at least £130m a year, under the proposals. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

Sara wants to be able to contribute to a society by becoming a doctor to help othersAnd some new teachers in England could be given an additional £5,000 in their third and fifth years in the classroom in a bid to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis within the profession.The move has been broadly welcomed across the sector. But for the strategy to be effective, headteachers must be on board. They are in charge of school workload polices.And let’s not forget that more than 50 per cent of children in state schools in England are now taught in an academy. And these schools have many more freedoms to decide how they will manage their staff.It will take a lot more to change the culture in schools. Marking and planning lessons late into the evening and at the weekends is normal for many teachers. And headteachers who fear bad exam results, or a poor Ofsted inspection result, may be reluctant to take a more relaxed approach.Meanwhile, funding pressures will inevitably increase the pressures on staff as they struggle to keep the same provision in place with fewer teachers and resources.The extra cash and resources to reduce workload and normalise part-time work is welcome. But I would not be surprised if we hear similar ministerial rhetoric and pledges in years to come. There appears to be no magic bullet to poor work-life balance and shortages within the profession.Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever.

Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, last week’s Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as last week’s Question Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As one of the toys that Andy didn’t gift to Bonnie before he left for college, Bo has spent years on her own, and it appears the experience has changed her.\u0026nbspDirector Josh Cooley told E! News: “Bo’s taken control of her own destiny. While Woody was watching Andy grow up, Bo gathered dust until she took it upon herself to head out into the world. And when Woody shows up, they can’t believe that they’ve found each other again.”The official synopsis for the film reads: “Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that’s Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called ‘Forky’ to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy.”Hanks teased the climax of the film as a “moment in history“, adding: “The way you record Toy Story, you’re in a room with the team that has created it. When I went in for my last day of recording, I wanted to have my back to them, because usually, you’re facing him so he can look right up and you can talk about it. But I didn’t want to see them and pretend they couldn’t see me.”No official trailer has been released, but Disney has slowly teased new and returning characters through a series of short clips, introducing Forky, Ducky, and Bunny\u0026nbsp– alongside the return of Bo Peep.\u0026nbspToy Story 4\u0026nbspwill be released in cinemas on 21 June 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ashley Cowburn looks at some of the crucial amendments the Commons are set to vote on and considers what might happen nextClick to followThe IndependentIs the cliff edge in sight?Following Theresa May’s historic Brexit defeat a fortnight ago, MPs now have the opportunity to put their own plans to the Commons and shape the next step in\u0026nbspBritain’s exit from the European Union.More than\u0026nbspa dozen amendments from various factions of MPs are currently on the order paper for tomorrow, but it is not yet known which will be selected for a vote by the speaker of the Commons, John Bercow.He is expected to reveal his decision around midday, with votes subsequently taking place from 7pm once debates have concluded.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe majority of the amendments, if they win the backing of MPs, will not have the immediate force of law, but instead act as a signal to the prime minister of the kind of Brexit MPs are likely to accept.There are a few crucial amendments that have focused minds in the past week.No-deal Brexit puts UK food security at risk, warn Sainsbury’s, AsdaMay ready to demand removal of Irish backstop after Tory pressureBrexit fears drag UK consumer confidence to 18-month lowMay’s Brexit hopes dealt blow as Ireland says backstop won’t changeThe first is from\u0026nbspLabour MP Yvette Cooper, whose cross-party motion seeks to prevent a no-deal scenario by giving MPs the power to request an extension of the Article 50 process if the prime minister fails to secure backing for her plans by the end of February.As things stand, this amendment appears to have the best chance of passing, as\u0026nbspLabour frontbenchers have strongly hinted it will receive official backing from the party. Its passage would be significant, as it would give MPs –\u0026nbspnot the executive –\u0026nbspthe ability to control the UK’s exit date from the EU.A second group of amendments are concerned with\u0026nbspthe backstop proposal –\u0026nbspthe EU’s insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement against a hard border in Ireland, which is despised by Brexiteer MPs.One has been tabled by the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the influential 1922 Committee of the party’s backbenchers in Westminster. His plan requires the backstop to be replaced with “alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.It is hoped that if the government backs this move and it eventually passes the Commons on Tuesday, it would give the prime minister a mandate to return to Brussels and request changes.Created with Sketch.

Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.

The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.By the time they start school, a quarter of children show some degree of deficient or delayed development in language, communication, motor skills and “socio-emotional health”, according to the team, led by Dr Sheri Madigan from the University of Calgary.To investigate the possible link between screen time and developmental delays, the scientists used a standard milestone screening measure which involved questioning parents about their children’s abilities.Higher levels of screen time at the ages of two and three years turned out to be “significantly associated” with poorer test results at three and five years.Researchers said the findings suggested too much screen time can hold back children.They pointed out that child development “unfolds rapidly in the first five years of life”.“When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practice and master interpersonal, motor and communication skills, the researchers said.The study found that overall, children watched screens for an average of 17.09 hours per week at age two, 24.99 at age three, and 10.85 at age five.The authors urged health professionals to work with families to develop “personalised media plans” designed to place boundaries on children’s screen time.Facebook \u0027tricked children\u0027 into spending money on in-app gamesChildren offered depression therapy via smartphone to cut NHS waitsKate Hudson discusses taking a ‘genderless’ approach with parentingThe plans, customised for each family’s needs, would provide advice on setting and enforcing rules and imposing “screen-free zones” and “device curfews” in the home.British experts said more research was needed but agreed that parents should be encouraged to promote healthy interactive behaviour in their children.Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “This is the first study to show that increased use of screen time in very young children can be associated with slower development.\u0026nbspThese results add important weight to existing concerns that too much screen time can prevent young children from having the best start in life, by potentially reducing important opportunities for social interactions, physical activity and other experiences necessary for development.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The backstop is needed because of UK red – lines and was crafted by the UK and the EU to secure the Good Friday Agreement.\u0026nbsp“We remain open to positive changes regarding the future relationship and it is time for a more consensual cross- party approach to deliver this.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspBrexit ‘plan C’ emerges after Rees-Mogg unites with Tory RemainersLast week the European Parliament’s Brexit steering group, which Mr Verhofstadt chairs, agreed that “without such an ‘all-weather’ backstop-insurance, the European Parliament will not give its consent to the Withdrawal Agreement”.One amendment which looks set to be considered by MPs is the so-called Brady Amendment, tabled by the chair of the Tory MPs’ 1922 Committee Graham Brady.\u0026nbspThe plan, due to be voted on on Tuesday evening, says the backstop should be “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. The Government has indicated it will whip its MPs to back the proposal, though it is not clear whether it will pass.\u0026nbspAnother plan, known as the Malthouse Compromise after the Tory minister Kit Malthouse, would see the backstop dropped and the transition extended in exchange for the UK paying some of the financial settlement it owes Brussels.\u0026nbspEU officials speaking behind the scenes have already rejected this idea, stating that they would not agree to the removal of the backstop. One diplomat described it as “nonsense” while another said the suggestion was “funny and tragic” and had “zero chance” of working.Brexiteer Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith meanwhile said on Tuesday morning that the plan represented “the best hope that we’ve got”.\u0026nbspInsolvencies on the rise as Britain careers toward Brexit buffers Pound is predicted to soar if MPs reject no-deal BrexitWhat will happen in this week’s crucial Commons votes on Brexit?Brexit ‘plan C’ emerges after Rees-Mogg unites with Tory RemainersOther MPs have also tabled their own amendments. Most notable among these is the Cooper amendment, tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper. This would instruct the Government to extend Article 50 to the end of 2019 if the prime minister does not manage to agree to a deal by late February.Today’s amendments, which will be voted on subject to the Speaker John Bercow selecting them for debate, are to Theresa May’s statement about the defeat of her Brexit deal. The statement to MPs was required by the Withdrawal Act in the event that the plan was rejected by the Commons.The EU says it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, which was agreed by Theresa May late last year. The bloc however says it will consider changes to the so-called “political declaration” spelling out the future relationship between the EU, and that this could be a way to avoid the deployment of the controversial “backstop”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

If this is rejected by MPs, she will table a further amendable motion for debate the next day.If no new deal has been reached with the EU by February 13, Ms May will make a statement to the House that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Read our breaking story:Significant news starting to emerge from the No10 lobby briefing. Apparently, the prime minister told the cabinet that the withdrawal agreement text will need to be reopened.This is a big shift from May\u0027s original position that her deal is the best available. It also flies in the face of the EU\u0027s current position, as shown by my last post on Guy Verhofstadt.In a timely reminder of trouble ahead, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit chief has poured cold water on any attempts to reopen the withdrawal agreement.Guy Verhofstadt\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the EU’s legislature, which has to approve any deal, would not consent to a “watered down” agreement and that the controversial Irish backstop could not be ditched.More from our Europe correspondent Jon Stone:\u0026nbspThe DUP has thrown its weight behind\u0026nbspthe Malthouse compromise,\u0026nbspwhich has been dreamt up by an unlikely coalition of Tory Remainers and Brexiteers.The DUP\u0027s intervention is significant, as Theresa May needs their support to get any Brexit plan through parliament. However they are vehemently opposed to anything that makes Northern Ireland different to the rest of the UK.Arlene Foster, DUP leader, said: We believe it can unify a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of remainers and leavers.\u0026nbspIt also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union which would split the United Kingdom or keep the entire United Kingdom in the Customs Union and Single Market. Importantly, this proposal would also offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.\u0026nbspIf the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere is no better time to advance this alternative given the confusion and disarray which is now manifesting itself in Brussels.\u0026nbsp This has been displayed both by the contradictory EU statements and the panic stricken behaviour of the Irish government.”Pro-EU Tory Anna Soubry has rejected the compromise proposals that have been thought up by Remain and Leave supporting Tory MPs.We understand why MPs desperately concerned about crashing out of the EU are considering desperate measures but this latest proposal only heightens the risk of a no-deal outcome.The prospect of the EU ripping up the Withdrawal Agreement or allowing a transition period without the backstop is very remote - and for good reason given the risks to the Irish peace process.Instead, this scheme backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg is a recipe for the no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspthat the hard\u0026nbspBrexiters have always craved.On the BBC this morning Jacob Rees-Mogg cast doubt over his stance on\u0026nbspSir Graham Brady\u0027s amendment.\u0026nbspHe has said that if it has government support it means reopening the Withdrawal Agreement that would be very different from a backbench plan.Let\u0027s see what the Prime Minister says at the despatch box today and what the Brady amendment really means.\u0026nbspIf the Brady amendment is a Government amendment, effectively, that means the Withdrawal Agreement will be reopened - as Liam Fox said this morning - that\u0027s very different from a worthy backbench motion that doesn\u0027t do anything.\u0026nbspSo let\u0027s just wait and see on that.\u0026nbspHere is our countdown to Brexit video - what is needed to complete a deal with the EU?\u0026nbspThe Malthouse CompromiseOnly an emerging plan at this point, it would extend the transition period from the end of 2020 and in to December 2021 and allow the UK and EU to prepare properly for WTO terms or obviate this outcome by negotiating a mutually beneficial future relationship.It is reportedly backed by members of both the Remain and Leave camps of the Conservative party.Indicative votesCommons Exiting the European Union Committee chairman Hilary Benn wants a series of votes on various Brexit options to see where the most support lies.Labour\u0027s twin track approachThis calls for MPs to be able to vote on options to stop a no-deal exit, such as a customs union with the EU, as well as the possibility of a new Brexit referendum. Jeremy Corbyn has been careful not to commit Labour to officially back such a poll, though.Amendments have been tacked on to the Labour push, with the Liberal Democrats calling for Remain to be on the ballot paper in any referendum, and Labour backbenchers urging Parliament to legislate for a public vote.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightBecause of its flexibility, it could also be fabricated to cover large areas.This has major implications for the future of electronic intelligence, say the scientists.Professor Tomas Palacios, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Microsystems Technology Laboratories Centre for Graphene Devices and 2D Systems, said: What if we could develop electronic systems that we wrap around a bridge or cover an entire highway, or the walls of our office and bring electronic intelligence to everything around us? How do you provide energy for those electronics?We have come up with a new way to power the electronics systems of the future - by harvesting wi-fi energy in a way that\u0027s easily integrated in large areas - to bring intelligence to every object around us.In experiments, the rectenna generated about 40 microwatts of power when exposed to typical wi-fi signals of around 150 microwatts.That is more than enough to light up a simple mobile display or activate silicon chips.The research is published in the latest online issue of the journal Nature.Spanish co-author Professor Jesus Grajal, from the Technical University of Madrid, said a key application could be in the field of medical implants and pills that stream health data after being swallowed by patients.He added: Ideally you don\u0027t want to use batteries to power these systems, because if they leak lithium, the patient could die.To create the rectenna, the team used a novel 2D material called molybdenum disulphide, which at three atoms thick is one of the world\u0027s thinnest semiconductors.All antennas produce electricity, but normally in very tiny amounts.In a portable radio, for instance, an amplifier boosts the signal to allow broadcasts to be heard.The amplifier needs a suitable power source, such as a battery.The electricity obtained from radio waves comes in the form of a high-frequency alternating current (AC).In the new device, the semiconductor converts the AC signal into a more usable direct current.The scientists are now planning more complex devices with improved efficiency.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”. A ­referendum with Remain on the ballot paper would threaten that.“Political parties ought to make sure they are ready to fight an ­election”, a member of the Tory party board tells me as he explains why they are rapidly stepping up candidate selection and the like. But I am told that “no one is planning an election”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries. But this was slashed to £ – which doesn’t cover the £ a month he and his partner spend on strong cider.His rent, meanwhile, is paid in full via a separate taxpayer-funded handout.Fungi also says his drinking habit means he can’t work. Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was sick with worry and suffering sleepless nights too.I worked in an office on minimum wage and had rent and bills to pay - there was no way I could clear it.I was telling a friend about it one night and she said she had a sure-fire way to make money easily - by working as an escort.  She told me she was doing it and raking it in.I wasn’t sure at first, but when my mate explained I’d get good money and wouldnt need to have sex with anybody, I went for it - I had no close family to help me out and I was desperate.She told me to start advertising on a social media site called Faceparty, where I uploaded pictures and explained I was available for dates. And it wasnt long before the clients came flooding in.There is no typical client.

You have to be happy, upbeat, put them at their ease and be able to communicate.You have to swot up on dferent cultures and religions too because I date men from all religions and walks of le .

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No excuses.”Guaido has continued to ramp up his challenge against Maduro, calling for anti-government protests on Wednesday and Saturday.Protests have already resulted in burned out cars, looted shops and deaths as civilians take to the streets to support the effort to oust Maduro.Maduro has turned Venezuela into an economic basket case during his five-year reign, with uncontrolled inflation hurting the lives of everyone in the oil-rich nation.Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging.Since Guaidó swore himself in, China, Russia and Syria have all backed Maduro, with Russia warning America off military force.On Sunday, colonel Jose Luis Silva, Venezuelas top military representative to the US, defected from Maduros government.In a statement, apparently read in his Washington office, Silva said: Today I speak to the people of Venezuela, and especially to my brothers in the nation’s armed forces, to recognise President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president.Guaido has said he will continue as interim president until a free and fair election can be called.Last week Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told CNN: We warn everyone, not just the US, but some others that can entertain these ideas from this type of action.He said: The resort to military power would be catastrophic."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NIP000465067074.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mass closure of playparks insurer end cover","story":"Zurich reportedly said it is unlikely to renew policies about to end.Charities warned that  playparks, many in deprived areas, could shut.

There is no great appetite for it but the appetite would changeit becomes new government policy.”As insults flew between Tory MPs today, one likened Mr Rees-Mogg’s hardliners to Millwall-style football thugs.The law states that after the deals defeat, the PM must make a statement in the Commons announcing her plans - which she did last Monday, saying she would press on with her current deal.The Government must then table a so-called neutral motion to be voted on - stating simply that the House of Commons has considered the statement made by the PM.Why does the vote matter Whether or not MPs vote in favour of the motion tabled by Mrs May is literally meaningless.But crucially, the motion can be amended - giving the Commons the right to pass any resolution it wants and dictate to the Government what it should do next.What are the amendments There are two main amendments - one from Labours Yvette Cooper which rules out a No Deal Brexit, and another from top Tory Graham Brady which kills off the Irish backstop.But another dozen amendments have also been tabled from across the political spectrum.Commons Speaker John Bercow will this morning select roughly half a dozen which will go to a vote from around pm.Most of the amendments arent legally binding but would provide a clear political message to the Government.But the Cooper amendment is legally binding - making it more worrying to ministers than the others.So what next Tonight’s vote is not a rerun of the first meaningful vote on whether or not to approve the Brexit deal.That is likely to come some time in February - whatever happens this evening.The PM’s former policy chief George Freeman branded Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group members as “hardline Brexit ultras”.He tweeted: “Everyone will have to compromise a bit. But hardline Brexit “ultras” need to compromise, too, to secure Brexit”.Issuing another appeal tonight, Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis said: “I would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow, in terms of a meaningful vote that will come back later,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Home Secretary said the plans meant that EU free movement was ending as planned on March .But insiders admitted it was “unlikely” any EU national who doesn’t apply for temporary leave to remain after their initial three months would be deported.Mr Javid earlier came under pressure from Tory MPs to guarantee an end to “indefinite” detention for illegal immigrants.

We’re not going to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.”She also revealed the EU had been “reassured” a UK-wide backstop, seen as a major concession by Brussels, would be enough to get the deal over the line.And she said British negotiators had been unable to explain how technological solutions could replace the EU’s border solution “because they don’t exist”.She said: “We looked at every border on this earth, every border the EU has with a third country. There’s simply no way you can do away with checks and controls.”But she added: “We’re not wedded to our backstop. We’re open to any alternative suggestions from the UK. The problem is there weren’t any.“It’s dficult to see how the future relationship can take care of the Irish border issue given the UK has decided not only to leave the EU but also the Single Market and the Customs Union.”Ms Weyand added the EU’s current plan is the only workable fix to the border and “you could imagine a no deal scenario with the backstop being discussed”.She also contrasted the Commission’s decision to regularly debrief national capitals and MEPs on the talks with Mrs May’s less open approach.In a pointed barb at the PM and her close team, she said: “You can’t lead a negotiation like that in secrecy.“We’ve seen that on the UK side the fact that this was handled in a very small circle is now a big handicap.”Asked about an Article  extension, the German eurocrat said EU leaders would require proof there’s a majority in parliament for a way forward.And she also said she was confident the bloc “can handle” the fallout from no deal but she was “less sure” the UK would be able to. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes exactly two weeks after Theresa Mays original, -page deal suffered the worst defeat in House of Commons history. Out of the ashes of that defeat, a string of radically dferent Plan B options are taking shape - and could delay Brexit. In total there are  plans, some of which will be selected for a vote by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow at lunchtime. MPs will then vote on whichever options are selected at pm on Tuesday  January. The result is crucial, because evenits not legally binding, it will give Theresa May a mandate and a plan to bring back to the EU. So what are the amendments that have been proposed and what will they do  Heres our rolling guide. The  most important plans If there are just three plans you have time to read about about, make it these. . Theresa Mays own Plan B - but the vote means nothing  Theresa May has her own Plan B, which is a lot like her Plan A. She wants to tweak her -page Brexit deal - including the backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules - and thento the EU for more talks. She could then make other demands depending what MPs say - and vote for. But the vote on her actual Plan B means nothing - this time. Instead MPs are only voting that they have considered her way forward. The real meaningful vote will be on an amended Brexit deal, thought to be before mid-February.  The key amendment by Remainers would force Theresa May try to delay the  March date of Brexit - taking No Deal off the table. It is being led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles. Crucially it appeared it would be backed by the Labour frontbench and Jeremy Corbyn - giving it enough support to pass the Commons. The amendment would give MPs a vote directing Mrs May to request an extension of the Article  date from EU chiefs,there is no new deal by February . Officially No are against the amendment, but Remain-backing ministers are believed to secretly support it because it will allow the PM to delay Brexit without getting her hands dirty. There are disagreements about how long an extension would be. No warned it could be nine months, Labour chiefs want three months. So Ms Cooper said that decision would only be made by MPs further down the line. Also, it would have to be agreed with EU chiefs anyway. WILL IT SUCCEED  It has a good chance. Labour indicated it would back the amendmentthe extension was cut to three months. But Downing Street said it would whip Tory MPs to vote against it - even though some ministers were in favour. The key amendment by Tory Brexiteers is to scrap a crucial clause called the Irish backstop - and Theresa May is backing it. The backstop, which could trap the UK under EU customs rules, is the main reason MPs defeated the -page Brexit deal by a record margin. So veteran MP Graham Brady led a group of Tories who said theyll change their mind and back the deal -the backstop is replaced with alternative arrangements. Crucially, with government backing Sir Grahams bid might just pass on Tuesday - which would send an ultimatum to the EU to think again. But the amendment prompted a huge row with Ireland, whose deputy PM said: The European Parliament will not raty a Withdrawal Agreement that doesnt have a backstop in it. Its as simple as that. WILL IT SUCCEED  It looked almost impossible. The government announced it was whipping MPs to vote for the amendment - but the hard-Brexit ERG group led by Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was opposing it. They apeared to be wobbling and would only make a final decision one hour before the vote. But Tory Remainers also called the amendment ludicrous, leaving it looking like it was doomed to failure.   Other major plans These are plans that have a fair bit of support, but either arent expected to pass, or are too similar to another amendment above. . Give MPs a say on all options - including a second referendum  Jeremy Corbyns amendment calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options. Theyd include Labours own Brexit plan with a full customs union with the EU, and also the option for a second referendum. Labour claims its version of Brexit which would include a permanent customs union, relationship with the single market and alignment on rights and standards could get a Commons majority. But Tory rebels are unlikely to back it. And a growing number of Labour MPs want the party to get behind a second referendum instead. Peoples Vote supporters hailed the amendment as a major step forward to a public ballot. But shadow minister Rebecca Long-Bailey denied it made a second referendum much more likely. And it was simply in line with Labours conference motion back in September , which called for all options to be on the table.  Tory MP Caroline Spelman has put down a very simple amendment that rejects the prospect of No Deal Brexit . The problem is, her bid gives absolutely no explanation of how the UK will actually reject No Deal - which is still the legal default on March . But that very same lack of detail has allowed MPs to unite around a single block No Deal amendment, even though they disagree about how to get there. More than  MPs from a range of parties including the Tories, Labour and SNP united to sign the amendment. . Let MPs choose between four ways forward  An amendment by Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, would give MPs indicative votes on the way forward. MPs would choose from dferent options to see which would come out on top. They are:Another vote on Theresa Mays deal A No Deal Brexit Renegotiate the deal with EU to achieve a specic outcome A second EU referendum. MPs take control of the Commons timetable  Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve originally wanted a radical plan to let backbenchers take control of the Commons timetable - MPs, including five parties and  Tories, backed the proposal. But he watered it down to a much less exciting version after No branded it a coup. The new plan lets MPs take control of parliamentary business one day each fortnight between now and March . It is backed by MPs from across Parliament, including fellow Tories like ex-ministers Justine Greening and Sam Gymiah, plus Phillip Lee, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. The amendment states that on February  and , and March , ,  and , the first item of business in the Commons would be a motion on Brexit. Tory MP Anna Soubry said she would back a combination of the Cooperand Grieve plans, because put together, they can ensure No Deal is blocked and Parliament takes back control. Plans that have been ditched These plans have been dumped to clear the way for the Brady amendment . Demand an expiry date on the Irish backstop Tory MP Andrew Murrison tabled a short and sweet amendment to set an expiry date of  December on the Northern Ireland backstop. He claimed it could help get Theresa Mays deal over the line by appealing to moderate MPs who just want Brexit sorted. But the EU has repeatedly ruled out putting an expiry date on the backstop. So since drawing up this amendment Mr Murrison has shted his support to Graham Brady,whose demand to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements may have more luck. Kill off the Irish backstop Tory MP John Baron tabled a trio of amendments to dump the Northern Ireland backstop - none of which the EU would accept. His amendments would either kill off the backstop completely limit it to just six months or allow it to be terminated without EU permission. Needless to say the EU wouldnt accept this. And Mr Baron withdrew two out of three of his amendments, leaving only the one about terminating the backstop without EU permission. The rest of the plans These are the rest of the plans on the table. At the time of writing none looked like they would pass. CANCEL Brexit SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is leading a bid to revoke Article  - cancelling the  March date of Brexit altogether. This because the UK can cancel Brexit without EU permission, but needs the EUs say-so to delay it. Put a Citizens Assembly in charge Labour MP Stella Creasy has proposed forcing the government to delay Brexit, with EU permission, and set up a Citizens Assembly. This new body would have a representative sample of  people to consider next steps. With help from the supergroup Liaison Committee, this Assembly would make recommendations to the House of Commons within  weeks. The government would have to respond within two weeks and set out how it will ensure the recommendations can be implemented in full. Delay Brexit II Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP, has an amendment to extend the March  date of Brexittheres no agreement by the end of February. It is a lot like Yvette Coopers amendment but would work slightly dferently. Labour were looking at whether to officially support it. Just like any plan to delay Brexit, this amendment would need the EUs approval. Prepare for a second referendum Lib Dem leader Vince Cable wanted to “instruct the Government to take all necessary steps to rule out a no-deal scenario and prepare for a People’s Vote in which the public will have the option to remain in the European Union on the ballot paper. Preparing for a second referendum is not quite like holding one. And its likely this would be rejected by MPs. The amendment disappeared on the day of the vote. Indicative votes The former Labour MP Frank Field has joined forces with Tory Ed Vaizey to give MPs a say on a iety of options. Their amendment would mean the Commons would have to allow time for a series of votes to act as a powerful guide to the government. The options would include:Reforming the Northern Ireland backstop Leaving the EU without a deal Delaying the UKs exit from the EU Canada-style future relationship Norway-style future relationship Customs union Holding a new referendumSet up a cross-party committee The Liberal Democrat Tom Brakes amendment would create a cross-party committee to take charge of the Brexit process. It would have power to decide when parliamentary time should be made available for Brexit debates and legislation, including on a fresh referendum with Remain on the ballot paper, to appoint special advisers, and to travel within the UK and to Brussels. Delay Brexit and rule out No Deal SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has an amendment to extend the  March Brexit date, rule out a no deal Brexit and call on the Commons to heed the votes of the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments. And finally... a plan that had to be ditched A second EU referendum  MPs pulled a straight vote on a second EU referendum after confessing it would not have enough support in the House of Commons. The cross-party group had wanted MPs to vote on an amendment calling for a new public referendum. But five days before the vote they announced they will not table the amendment - admitting not enough MPs support it. The group, including Labours Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, blamed Jeremy Corbyn - saying he should do the right thing and give unequivocal backing to a second referendum to ensure it can pass. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said: We could have the numberswe had the unequivocal backing of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership. I think that is where we will get to eventually.

Mrs May believes that she can push Brussels for major changes to the backstopshe is able to show that Parliament is behind her. After the meeting, Tory party chair Brandon Lewis said: “It does mean the PM can go back to Brussels and show there’s a Parliamentary majority for a deal that sorts the issue out.”   A No  spokesman earlier confirmed that the PM was prepared to ask Brussels to reopen the orce deal - despite them previously saying no.The PM also revealed that MPs would get another chance to vote on Brexit Plan Bs on February  and she will “battle away” to get her deal through.And she slapped down her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who asked what changes the Brady plan would bring. “We won’t know unless you support us,” she scolded. But the Brady plan was effectively left for dead after Mr Rees-Mogg said his pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs had no plans to support it. Mr Rees-Mogg said that adding a legal codicil to the existing -page withdrawal plan was not enough. He said: “From our point of view, it needs to be a change to the text”. What happens next  The ERG wants the Government to bring forward its own amendment setting out the next steps by pm today. The DUP, which props up Mrs May’s administration, was also keeping No  sweating overnight over whether it will support the plan. But the EU closed the door on any further concessions on the backstop. Senior Brussels official Sabine Weyand said: “There is no negotiation between the UK and the EU. That is finished.”Ms Weyand, one of the architects of the Brexit agreement, warned there was a “very high risk” of an accidental no deal Brexit instead.“Crashing out is the only outcome that requires nobody to make any decisions,” she said. “We think we can handle it. I’m less sure about UK side”. Mrs May herself has previously warned MPs that Brussels would not be prepared to renegotiate. Mr Brady said his amendment - which would scrap the backstop in favour of “alternatives” to avoid a hard border - would give the PM “enormous firepower”. “If my amendment is carried, she goes back to Brussels and says - you wanted to know what we can get through the House of Commons  This is it,” he said.In what is shaping-up to be Brexit’s “Super Tuesday”, Labour was expected to back a move by Yvette Cooper to delay Brexit Day for at least three months.A handful of Labour MPs are thought to be against the plan, although co-signatory Nick Boles, a Tory MP, claimed it had “a great deal of support among ministers”. The PM will face down her ided Cabinet ahead of the vote and is expected to warn them they must get into line.

For an interim period EU citizens will be able to enter the UK as they do now. But following the end of free movement, those wishing to stay longer than three months will need to apply for permission under a new European Temporary Leave to Remain scheme.   People who obtain this status will be entitled to live, work and study in the country for a further three years. EU citizens wishing to extend their stay beyond three years will have to make a further application under the new skills-based immigration system, which is due to be introduced from . Mr Javid said: If we leave the EU without a deal we will continue to deliver on the referendum result and end free movement once and for all - giving us full control of our borders for the first time in decades. However, we need to take a practical approach and minimise disruption to ensure the UK stays open for business. That is why we will introduce time-limited transitional arrangements and grant EU citizens coming after March  temporary leave.   But Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, criticised the plans. He said: This is free movement in all but name and is an astonishing concession before the situation of one million Brits in Europe has even been considered. Yet again, the government have completely caved in to the business lobby. Most of the public want a reduction in immigration not to see it prolonged for years on end. Under the proposals, applications for European Temporary Leave to Remain will be subject to identity, criminality and security checks. Applicants face being rejectedofficials determine that they are a serious or persistent criminal or a threat to national security.  The initial three months leave to enter will be free of charge, but applications for temporary leave to remain will need to be paid for. Fees will be set out at a later date. Non-EU family members who wish to accompany an EU national under the arrangements will need to apply for a permit in advance. Irish citizens will not need to apply for European Temporary Leave to Remain and will continue to have the right to enter and live in the UK under the Common Travel Area. Mr Javid also emphasised that the policy does not apply to those in the UK before exit day, whose rights to live and work will be protected by the EU Settlement Scheme. We want them to stay and value them hugely, the Home Secretary added.

It was revealed today that the Duke of Sussex, , will be in Norway on official duties on the most romantic day of the year. Kensington Palace tweeted that Harry will be visiting a remote training camp  miles inside the Arctic Circle on February . He will be there to celebrate the th anniversary of Exercise Clockwork in Bardufoss - the traditional name of the annual winter exercise that trains Royal Marines and Royal Navy sailors and airmen. The Palace also tweeted: “The Duke of Sussex will meet military personnel living and training on the base, view some of the specialist outdoor severe weather equipment and training that is conducted at Clockwork and talk with expert aircrews and engineers.”   The Duchess of Sussex, who is around six months pregnant with their first child, will be unlikely to join Harry on the royal trip as the visit will include spending time in one of “the world’s most demanding environments”. Meanwhile, a body language experts has weighed in on why the pregnant duchess is constantly cradling her bump. According to Harry Witchel it is the -year-old’s attempt at reserved royal behaviour. He told the Mail on Sunday: Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded.  Thats quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so  This doesnt look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body. Meghan will give birth in the spring, but her exact due date has not been made public. The new arrival will be seventh in line to the throne, but it is unlikely that the baby boy or girl will be given the title of Prince or Princess. Instead they will probably become a Lord or a Lady as they are too far down the line of succession.   Ahead of the birth, Meghan and Harry will leave Kensington Palace and London and move to their new home Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. They are currently renovating the home, a present from the Queen, and getting the nursery ready for Baby Sussex.

Sammy-Jo is now looking to order a wrist strap with a small lock on the child size which can not be removed. She says she is struggling to sleep and Erik has refused to speak about it. The horric incident happened at Flying Scotsman Health Centre in Doncaster, South Yorks., and has since been reported to South Yorkshire Police. She said: I just hope hell forget what happened soon. Im hoping once he gets back to nursery he will be at ease - right now he is emotional. South Yorkshire police have been contacted for comment.

Evie Crandles mother said she was broken beyond repair following the death of her baby girl in April last year. Samantha McNeice and her partner Phil Crandle took their baby to Whiston Hospital, in Merseyside with signs of sepsis, including a high temperature and heart rate. But as Liverpool Echo reports , despite being seen by a number of members of medical staff, she was not treated for sepsis until  hours after her admission. The youngster was instead sent home with ibuprofen and Calpol and died two days later on April  after being admitted to Alder Hey. An inquest into Evies death began at Liverpool Coroners Court yesterday. Here her parents claimed that their little girl had been let down in the worst possible way by medical staff. ■ Sepsis affects , people in the UK and kills , per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined. ■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection. ■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swtly get serious. ■ Seek medical help urgentlyyou develop any one of the following… – are lethargic or dficult to wake – feel abnormally cold to touch – the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale – are breathing very fast – have a rash that does not fade when you press it – have a fit or convulsion In a heartbreaking statement, Samantha - who is nearly eight months pregnant - told the court, through tears, how she is petried she will again lose her baby. The inconsolable mum said: We are broken beyond repair. I have this baby on the way, due in six weeks and I am petried. Im scared she might get ill and no-one will listen again and I will lose her too. The mum, from Whiston, told the court how her daughter showed almost all the signs of sepsis. She said: She was throwing up from waking up, getting blue lips, cold hands and feet, she was very lethargic, had a very high temperature . and a fast heart rate . She wasnt herself at all. We explained to the nurses and doctors how Evie has so much energy and doesnt enjoy sitting on your knee cuddling, she is off playing and exploring and she couldnt do that. She couldnt lt her arms. She was trying to sleep all day. I asked why she was sleeping but her eyes were staying open a little. Evie never did this before.   Samantha, who had a picture of Evie in front of her throughout the inquest, said both herself and Phil knew the signs of sepsis and asked over and over about it. She added: We knew enough about sepsis to ask about it in the only place that could treat her, to identy the signs and ask for help fast. And our daughter was let down in the worst way possible. Shes gone from our lives forever. Young children and older people are most at risk - but ANYONE can get sepsis We cry every single day and I just cant imagine that stopping. She was so brave and so strong. Our lives were built around Evie, she was the centre of our universe. We have lost our daughter and have to face the fact we knew what was wrong with her. I feel like I failed Evie in the worst possible way.  Liverpool Coroners Court also heard from Evies devastated dad Phil, who said he cant bring himself to speak of his daughter in the past tense. Visibly upset he told the court, which was full with Evies friends and family: My daughter Evie is perfect. No-one knows her like her Mum and Dad, we love her beyond words can explain and will forever. She is exceptional and in her short  months and eight days you could see the beautul person she was blossoming into. So confident and clever, so full of character and cheek, so happy and always looking to explore and learn and more beautul that I could ever have imagined and so brave and strong at the end. Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death. Early symptoms of sepsis may include:a high temperatureor low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathingIn some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shockdevelop soon after. These can include:feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousnessWhen to get medical help Seek medical advice urgently from NHS youve recently had an infection or injury and you have possible early signs of sepsis. If sepsis is suspected, youll usually be referred to hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Severe sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies. If you think you or someone in your care has one of these conditions, go straight to AE or call .  We asked about sepsis straight away and even sat under a poster in the waiting room, we were told its more likely a urine infection by a band  nurse and felt such relief despite still feeling such fear. They could never let a  month old down, but they did. Liverpool Coroners Court heard how Sam and Phil arrived at Whiston Hospital with their daughter at around .am. However despite indicating signs of sepsis medical staff believed the youngster had a water infection and a urine sample was requested. The court, on the first day of the inquest, heard from three members of medical staff, pediatric nurses Kay Archer and Penny Hartley and Dr Jenner Hale. All three members of staff told the court how Evie did not present as a sceptic child. The court also heard how all members of staff had since had further training on sepsis, following the death of Evie. The inquest continues.

Joanne Thomas, , has shed st lbs after struggling to lt her bulky frame off the floor at a parent and toddler group left her so humiliated she knew enough was enough. The mum-of-two, who weighed st lbs and was a size  at her biggest, started to pile on the pounds during her second pregnancy with son Noah Grant. Joanne told herself she didnt need to worry about her weight while pregnant, bingeing on daily microwave meals, takeaways and six pieces of toast lathered with marmite. Determined to turn her le around for her family, Joanne joined Slimming World in April last year and has since dropped four dress sizes.   Now a svelte st lb, Joanne feels a million dollars and said her partner Stephen Grants jaw hit the floor at his th birthday party when she strutted in wearing a fitted jumpsuit. Joanne, from Thatcham, Berkshire, said: Its like Im a new woman, I feel like a million dollars. Im much more confident and better in myself. Its nice to go out and feel that people arent looking at you, or looking at you for the right reasons. People say whats your trick  but there isnt a magic wand - its about how much you want it.   You have to have amazing willpower. Stephens th was a massive aim for me. I didnt want him to think oh, I have a fat girlfriend that used to be thinner. But it wasnt really for him, it was the milestone I set for myself. He kept telling me I was doing great and was very reassuring and supportive. Hes amazed at how Ive stuck to it and been so focused. We went out for his th and I was wearing a jumpsuit. I came down to the hotel bar and his jaw nearly fit the floor. He said he was a lucky man and I looked stunning and he was really proud of me.  As of this week I can go into any shop now get a size  off the shelf and it fits perfectly. Its a huge dference. The mum-of-two admitted she used to gorge on takeaways and convenience foods during her -hour shts as a care assistant since starting their relationship in . After having son Noah Grant in March  Joanne said she soon felt embarrassed and inadequate when she struggled getting up from the floor at parent and child groups. It wasnt until after shed had Noah that the toll of her eating for two mentality was revealed as she spiralled to st lbs and spent months squeezed into maternity wear. Joanne claims one of the key turning points in her weight loss journey was when she had to ask other mums to hold Noah while she struggled to get onto the floor or stand up again because of her size.  A dficult pregnancy meant she was housebound towards the end and found herself eating out of boredom. Joanne said: When Noah was around three months old I took him to a music class. Wed have to sit on the floor and someone would have to hold him while I struggled to get up, I felt embarrassed and inadequate. I wanted to be able to get around like the other mums could and felt I needed to be thinner to give Noah the best childhood he could. Now I just tuck him under my arms and get up off the floor easily. Before Noah wed eat rubbish at home. Id be working  hours shts at the hospital and eating lots of takeaway, but I was only around a stone and a half heavier than I am now.   During pregnancy I thought oh, I dont have to worry about this for nine months, so Id eat six slices of toast with marmite for breakfast and the biggest cinnamon bun that youve ever seen. After having Noah, Joannes weight spiralled to  stone as shed suffered with pelvic pain and overeaten for months. Two months passed and trendy Joanne was still wearing her maternity clothes or struggling to fit into her size  leggings. Increasingly wary of her lack of energy and inability to play with her baby, Joanne ed to an old Slimming World class hoping to take back control. Joanne said: I wasnt always huge but I did pile on masses in that pregnancy. I remember going to my first midwe appointment and being mortied that I was already  st lbs. I had a horrendous pregnancy with swelling and a bad pelvis, and I was really inactive for the last trimester.  I was very immobile as well - obviously Id gone from working -hour shts three or four times a week, to basically being housebound. Everything spiralled, I wasnt mobile so Id sit and eat. I didnt have anything  to do, so Id sit and eat more. When Id had the baby and brought him home, I couldnt do anything. I was so fat and uncomfortable, I couldnt even get on the floor to play with him. When he was five weeks old I went back to Slimming World and I decided I wanted to lose weight more than anything. Despite previously trying Slimming World back in , her weight gain and embarrassment at being unable to move freely at the parent and baby group spurred her on to try the Thatcham group again.  Joanne said: I stuck to the plan religiously and now when I think to myself I want a cake I think I want the weight loss more. I wanted to be healthy and thinner and to be able to run around with my boys. I didnt want to be fat forever - I want to see my kids grow up. Noahs crawling now and Im running round like a lunatic half the time trying to move everything from his reach. I want to play on the park and get my fat bum down the slide - all the things I could never do.   After getting back into Slimming World, Joanne began to cook family dinners from scratch and has enjoyed watching the pounds slip off. She even enjoys fakeaways to replace her old favourite - fried chicken and chips. But the bubbly mum says she hasnt once stepped into a gym, crediting her slender shape to healthy eating and a short walk to the corner shop once a day.Joanne said: When I was pregnant I had horrendous heartburn so I lived on McDonalds milkshake.Now I fancy something like that or KFC, Id never go and buy one. Id just find a way of making a healthy one myself. I do all my cooking from fresh. Before, I couldnt stand to do that so we grabbed what we could get - takeaways and unhealthy foods. Now for breakfast I might have poached eggs with mushrooms or tomatoes, or Ill have a wholemeal bagel, bacon with no fat and cheese. Before Breakfast - Four pieces of toast with marmite and butterLunch - Cheese sandwich, salt and vinegar crisps, sausage rollDINNER - Large kebabSnacks - Slice of chocolate cake, Dairy Milk chocolate bar , McDonalds strawberry milkshakeTotal  ,  calories Now Breakfast- Poached eggs with mushrooms and tomatoesLUNCH - Smoked salmon and scrambled egg bagelDinner - Spaghetti Bolognese with rocketSnacks - None Total  ,  calories  For lunch Ill have a jacket potato because Im always out meeting other mums, or soups, omelettes. I dont avoid carbs either. At night well have anything from a chilli, spaghetti bolognese, chicken kebabs, roast dinners - proper food. I think the thing with Slimming World is that it isnt a fad diet. It teaches you to live the rest of your le eating healthy, balanced meals. Its family food as well, we all sit down and enjoy an evening meal together now. I dont do any exercise or classes, we might walk to the shop once a day to get some milk but I dont do anything . No gym classes, no aerobics - Im definitely not a runner.

But a Facebook post on January , , would change both their lives. Determined not to give in to chronic kidney failure which left her exhausted and suffering agonising headaches , Louise, from London, decided to tell her story on social media. Kayleigh, from Baldock, Herts, saw the post and felt moved to help – by giving one of her kidneys to a stranger. Now, seven months on from surgery, -year-old Louise is not only regaining her strength, the pair are best friends. They message and chat every day and, despite living  minutes apart, they meet up regularly. “We’re in this together, doing shyeverything as a team, which has been incredible,” says Louise.   Louise, who works in HR, was shydiagnosed with renal failure when she was just eight. “Every time I did any activity at school I’d pass out, be sick or get a high temperature, so that was a sign something wasn’t right,” she says. “Doctors told my parents both my kidneys were only working at around %. They were small, ing poorly and heavily scarred. They said I was never going to make it to shyadulthood with that set of kidneys. “I was unusual, though, because my kidneydidn’t decline for a long time. Although the tiredness and nausea increased, I was strong and stubborn, determined I would never let anyone see me as dferent. I came out of school with  GCSEs and  A- levels and did a degree in psychology.” After university, Louise went shytravelling, spending a year working in New York before moving to London. But in , aged , her kidneyplummeted to just %. The moment she had been dreading had arrived.   Family and friends offered to become donors, but the final three potential blood and tissue matches were ruled out. “Despite knowing for  years that this ‘end stage’ would come, I still had no donor,” Louise recalls. Next she joined the deceased donor list. “It was a long, terrying wait, jumping every time my phone rang in case it was ‘the call’.” But then one afternoon, having missed a friend’s birthday party because she was too exhausted, Louise decided to take action. She started a Facebook page and, in January , wrote a post telling her story, explaining the risks and the process of a transplant, asking anyone who might want to help to get in touch. Some , views and three days later, -year-old Kayleigh sent her a message. She says: “I saw Louise’s post when it was shared by a friend, and I’d never heard of altruistic donors before, but we are a similar age and I just thought, whatthat was me or someone in my family  “I was the same blood type as Louise, O shypositive, so I Googled to seeI could carry on normal le with just one kidney and everything I read said you could.”   Kayleigh and Louise chatted for a week on Facebook and instantly clicked. “There was no hesitation, I trusted her with my le,” says Louise. They met up when Kayleigh went to Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London for preliminary tests in February last year. Both admit they were nervous. “I was about to meet the lady who might save my le,” says Louise. Kayleigh says: “I was thinking, whatshe doesn’t like me  But when we saw each other we had a massive hug.” Two weeks later, Kayleigh found she was a match, and on June , the two had their shytransplant shyoperation. Louise says: “With a live donation, the donor goes to theatre then they send the recipient down to get ready so the kidney is only out for a minimum amount of time.” Returning to a ward after six hours of surgery each, they recovered in adjoining beds. Kayleigh adds: “I could see Louise looking better all the time, her skin tone changed colour. I was in pain from the surgery but seeing that every day she was getting better was the best feeling.” Now Kayleigh says the two women have formed a bond for le. “What’s happened because of that one Facebook post has been incredible,” says Kayleigh. “It has completely changed my outlook on le.” Louise is on medication to make sure her body doesn’t reject the kidney but says she already notices a dference. “Kayleigh and I would have been best friends regardless because we just clicked. I will be forever grateful for what’s she’s done for me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"plane passenger meltdown because shes","story":"NewsPlane passenger has meltdown because shes sat between two fat pigsThe unnamed passenger was later ejected from the flight because of her abusive comments on the United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New JerseyShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news us-news video woman-fat-shames-passengers-united-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA rude plane passenger had a meltdown because she had to sit inbetween two “big” passengers.

And thats exactly what Noah, who claims to be from the year , says he is. His latest prediction is about what the country will look like in  years time - by which point Parliament may actually have come to an agreement about what happens next. For the  percent of Brits who voted to Leave, however, Noah’s news might not be welcome. In the video, the pixelated figure claims that, despite Brexit , the UK will re-join forces with the EU again as par of a European superstate.   I have come back to tell you guys the truth and everything there is to know about the future, claimed Noah to the paranormal investigations YouTube channel, ApexTV. There’s a lot for me to say. First thing, the United Kingdom actually comes back into the European Union. Presumably referring to his point in time, he goes on to say everyone knows [the UK] left a while ago now, before claiming the country s before . “The thing about the European Union in the future is all the countries in the EU actually converge together into one giant country, and the UK kind of acts like a district in this giant country,’ he continued.   Including the likes of Germany, Spain, France and Denmark in the plans, Noah claims other nations will supposedly follow suit in the trend of merging borders - much to the dismay of Brexiteers everywhere. A new currency will also apparently be introduced by the superstate, making both the Pound and Euro obsolete. Noah also warned of drastic changes to the UK’s temperature as global warming accelerates in the coming years, bearing with it irrevocable change.  It does signicantly change, the United Kingdom’s temperature, he says. “Global warming is a very bad thing that we have, and I don’t know what to tell you guys. “You need to change something right nowyou don’t want the temperature and everything to change.” In another audacious claim, Noah says Britons will also have a chip implanted into their heads, helping to increase brain-capacity up to six times over.  Another chip will be placed into civilian’s wrists too, regulating both physical and mental health. But not all viewers of the bizarre video were believers in Noah. “Why is he always wearing the same clothes ,” asked one YouTube user. “LMAO, how many of you actually take this kid seriously ,” said another.

Last year there were  deaths in the town, compared with just  births.He told CNN that working-age people have left the town in droves in recent years looking for jobs in Turin and other big cities.  He said: “Our school each year faces the risk of shutting down due to few pupils. I cannot allow this to happen. “We’re looking to draw mostly young people and professionals who work remotely or are willing to start an activity here. “There are dozens of closed shops, bars, restaurants and boutiques just waiting for new people to run them. “Locana offers a healthy lestyle, great food and folklore fairs all year round.”  While the town is small, it is wealthy thanks to the clean hydroelectric energy it sells to Italy’s state. And situated in a privileged location amid the snowy peaksthe Gran Paradiso mountain reserve, Locana residents have fresh air and outdoor activities such as ice-skating, trekking, fishing and rock climbing at their doorsteps. Among dozens of potential dwellings in need of refurbishment are chapels, lodges, dairy farms, mills and copper mines, while two nearby ghost hamlets are accessible by foot down overgrown paths. Locana isn’t the only Piedmont town trying to draw in new residents with attractive offers.  Further north on the Swiss border, the mayor of Borgomezzavalle has offered to give , eurosto anyone who has a baby there, and another ,to anyone willing to start and register a business. Alberto Preioni is also offering abandoned mountain cottages for just one euro - p - in a desperate attempt to revive the village which has dwindled to just  residents. Borgomezzavalle - which means ‘the town between the valley’ - is situated in a canyon, but there’s sunlight all day thanks to a huge mirror constructed on the opposite hillside which reflects the rays.

Zhang Jiafengs, who had dated Zhang Xiaoyu for a year, proved that the old adage that love can overcome anything. He took care of her in hospital day and night - even after doctors said she had little chance of regaining consciousness. Roughly two years later, with Jiafeng keeping a dedicated vigil at her bedside through, Xiaoyu showed signs of consciousness. The first thing she is believed to have said was her boyfriends name.  The couple got engaged two years later and are now living a happy, married le in their hometown in eastern China. The incredible story took place between  and  in the city of Bengbu in Anhui Province. But it only became known to the public last year when Jiafeng was awarded by the Chinese authority for his dedication towards his partner. According to Chinese media, Jiafeng and Xiaoyu were classmates in middle school and the two fell in love in  when they were both  years old. In , -year-old Xiaoyu collapsedand was rushed to hospital. She was diagnosed with hydrocephalus -a build-up of fluid in the brain - and needed emergency surgery.  The operation failed, leaving -year-old Xiaoyu in a vegetative state, according to reports. Xiaoyus family and her boyfriend were devastated. But instead of breaking up with her, Jiafeng insisted he stay to take care of Xiaoyu. Xiaoyus mother, Zhu Jianmei, was reluctant to let Jiafeng shoulder the task at first and suggested Jiafeng should find a new girlfriend. Speaking to reporters, Ms Zhu said: His family are from rural China and his parents had sacriced a lot to nurture him to be a university graduate. In addition, on what grounds could we allow him to stay   But Jiafeng refused. He said he had chosen to be with Xiaoyu.  He gained the permission to accompany Xiaoyu after kneeling in front of Xiaoyus mother to show his sincerity and determination. Jiafeng told Chinese media: When I was accompanying her, I had faith that she would come to one day in the future. Jiafeng quit his job to be a full-time carer for Xiaoyu and fed her liquid food using a large syringe. Xiaoyus mother said she was grateful to Jiafeng after her daughter largely recovered. He claimed that one day two years later, Xiaoyusuddenly looked like she wanted to talk. Jiafeng said: Afterwards, she called my name. I felt so relieved - like the sun had come out after a storm and a heavy stone had dropped from my chest.   After Xiaoyu gained consciousness, Jiafeng and her family members brought her to seek medical advice in larger cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, so she could recover and walk again. The couple got engaged in  and married in . Xiaoyu, now , is still recovering and she cannot walk farther than  metres, needing medication daily. In a latest interview this month, the husband told Pear Video : on , I wish to work better and harder. I wish to look after my business in order to take better care of her. The couples biggest wish is to be able to have a baby one day.

You may have heard the young girls name before -not youve undoubtedly scrolled past a picture of her face.Thats because Georgia, who has Downs syndrome, is a social media star, with more than , followers on her Instagram account.If that werent enough, the pretty teenager is also signed to five modelling agencies and has starred in ious commercials in her home country of Brazil. Speaking to The Sun, Rubia, , revealed how she accidentally kicked off her daughters modelling career. She said: During my pregnancy with Georgia, all my pre-natal exams were showing up ok, and we didnt have a clue she would be a child with Downs syndrome.Naturally at first it was a shock for us, but since the very first moment she was born she was received with a lot of love.It all started as a joke I posted a picture of her on Facebook and it was a hit straight away. The idea was to see how much it can inspire other Downs syndrome children.  Rubia explained that Georgia had always been lonely because other children her age dont have much patience with her. However she has found happiness in modelling. Georgia has always been very vain since she was little, she always liked clothes, bags, make-up and I always liked it too, so I believe she mirrored me, her mum said. I would parade her around, sing for her and I didnt know this would drive her career.   Despite her success on social media, Rubia admits there were times when it was dficult to continue posting photos online due to cruel comments. The hardest part was when I read some people post comments that she is only successful because of her blonde hair and blue eyes - Georgia is a very kind child and very talented, otherwise she would not have come so far. As well as modelling, Georgia hopes to one day become an actress or singer and is currently taking drama and music lessons.

to her.She pointed at the sanitary items and said she would not need any of them because she had not had a period for several months.Apparently, according to her GP, she was too malnourished.After helping to pioneer and manage the foodbank, alongside an excellent team of volunteers and trustees, I moved on to work with The Trussell Trust which joined forces with churches and communities to set up foodbanks to support local people experiencing short-term financial hardship.Every one of the  out of  local authorities where we had a foodbank presence provided sanitary items.In , my colleague Lyndsay and I arrived early for a meeting at the Scottish Parliament and decided to sit in the public gallery during First Minister’s Questions.Coincidentally, Labour MSP Monica Lennon asked how the first minister felt about voluntary organisations providing sanitary items to women and girls, before casually dropping the name of our organisation into the question.Lyndsay and I later contacted Monica, who had tabled a parliamentary debate to bring the issue to wider attention, and we agreed how great the need was.We had encountered many more women and girls on low incomes – not as malnourished as the young lady I referred to previously – who had supplemented the use of sanitary items with toilet paper, socks and even newspaper during their period.Other elected members joined the call and Lyndsay and I met Aileen Campbell MSP, who was the minister responsible for public health, to prompt the Scottish Government on universal free access.To the government’s credit, and thanks to the urgency of Gillian Martin MSP, a pilot was launched in Aberdeen in .The government later committed £. million to extend provision to educational facilities throughout Scotland.Last week, I was delighted to hear the government commit a further sum of £m to further extend access to libraries and leisure centres.It has also been inspiring to observe the efforts of others like Erin Slaven, Mikaela McKinley and Orlaith Duffy, the three incredible young women behind the On The Ball campaign, who have encouraged  football clubs in the UK to provide sanitary items free of charge at their home grounds.I still occasionally think about that young lady who came into the foodbank.I only saw her one more time, which was a fortnight after our first encounter, when she was referred to the foodbank for a second time.We were standing next to each other in a busy office and she squeezed my arm.I turned and looked at her and she said with a wry smile: “Since getting the food from here,

My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside. She said: \"There is so much fear about Alabama rot because not much is known about it. Its impossible to say where Georgie got it, she could have picked it up anywhere.\"We still walk by the river most days, we arent scared to walk there but I do make sure I get the mud off after.\"\"My advice to other dog owners is to be aware and on the lookout for sores on your dog.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mammoth-catch-at-this-years-selkirk-haggis-hunt","story":"MORE than  hunters headed onto Selkirk Hill at the weekend in search of the illusive haggis.And, as was forecast by organisers, they ed with a record catch.Glorious sunshine and crisp footing made for an excellent mornings sport.And for the first time in the historic huntrsquos history, woolly mammoth haggi were caught on the breeding grounds.Dave Scott from the organising committee told us: ldquoThe woolly mammoth haggi is an ancient strain of our beloved creature and they were plentul in Selkirk for the first time this year.ldquoFor decades it was thought they were extinct, but we have noticed more and more of these large colourful haggi here in Selkirk when weve been doing our inspections.\"There was a fear that theyd be like grey squirrels and scare away the smaller indigenous haggi but they all seem to live happily together.\"Were not sure why they migrated to Selkirk Hill but were happy to have them.ldquoEvery year there are more and more hunters but we are lucky having such tremendous breeding grounds that our haggis numbers remain fairly solid.As has become customary over the decades, the hunters were piped from the Market Place at .am.And, as superstition insists, the Haggis Polka was danced outside the Argus Centre to bring luck.Matthew Burgess, who took over as head huntsman from his late father Bob, made sure the strict rules were adhered to before toasting the haggis on competition of the dayrsquos sport.Mr Burgess told us: ldquoThere can be few better sights than  tartan clad hunters marching towards Selkirk Hill.ldquoOur forefathers maintained this wonderful tradition even when haggis was scarce, and their hard work has meant that today the next generation will never go hungry on Burns Night.Experts, many with with red noses, within the Townrsquos Arms hunt headquarters weighed in more than  haggi on Sunday afternoon ndash including more than  of the recently discovered woolly mammoth strain.Townrsquos Arms mine host Louise Stephen, who provided the pre- and post-hunt whisky toast, was delighted with the dayrsquos sport.She said: ldquoFewany left the hill without a catch.

We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country  mdash Boris JohnsonJanuary , But the chances of the Commons derailing her plans were also heightened when Labour confirmed it will back a cross-party bid to push Brexit day back from March  to as late as the end of this year and put Parliament in the driving seat on the way forward.This proposal, tabled by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, is one of the strongest-backed of a bevy of rival amendments tabled for debate. Only those selected by Speaker John Bercow will go forward to a vote.Mrs May is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening.Speaking to Cabinet, she said she aims toto the Commons ldquoas soon as possible with a revised deal, which will be subject to a ldquomeaningful vote of MPs. If it is defeated, she will table another amendable motion for debate the following day.If no new deal is reached by February , the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Her announcement brought the prospect of the cancellation of Parliamentrsquos half-term recess a step closer, as the Commons is currently due to rise for its -day break on February .Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, struck by Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and signed off by leaders of the remaining  EU states last November.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the EU was waiting to see what happened in Parliament.ldquoThis is not a Brussels day, this is a London day. We have the vote tonight and then we will take it from there, he said.And Irelandrsquos European Affairs Minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned: ldquoThere can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.But Mrs Mayrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoThere is a very clear message from the EUrsquos leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.Mrs May told Cabinet that a majority for the Brady amendment would send three vital messages to the EU by:ndash Making clear that the will of the House of Commons is to leave with a dealndash Setting out in no uncertain terms that the UK continues to be committed to arrangements which avoid a hard border in Ireland andndash Creating scope for new discussions with the EU on how best to achieve that.ldquoThe Prime Minister said that in order to win the support of the House of Commons, legal changes to the backstop will be required, said Mrs Mayrsquos spokesman. ldquoThat will mean reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs May on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment.Butit was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the  Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs Mayrsquos deal on January .MPs rejected Theresa Mayrsquos EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of  votes earlier this month The leader of the European Research Groupof eurosceptic backbenchers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, initially said its members were not prepared to support the Brady plan, though he later appeared to soften his line.Remain-backing Tories may rally behind the Cooper Boles amendment, while other proposals may gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labourrsquos Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party.Drawn up in meetings co-ordinated by housing minister Kit Malthouse, thecompromise recasts thebackstop as a ldquofree trade agreement-lite, with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border and an extended transition period to December .DUP leader Arlene Foster ndash whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration in the Commons ndash said it provided a ldquofeasible alternative to the backstop.ldquoIf the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on, said Mrs Foster.Former minister Nicky Morgan has been involved in talks on the so-called lsquoMalthouse compromisersquo Mrs Mayrsquos spokesman said the PM ldquowelcomes the fact that MPs are working together to come up with solutions, but declined to pass judgment on the Malthouse compromise.Remain-backing former minister Nicky Morgan said discussions had been taking place for ldquosome days between herself, health minister Stephen Hammond and Solicitor General Robert Buckland on one side and Mr Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from the ERG on the other.ldquoThe Prime Minister has been aware of the discussions.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

A few weeks earlier Canadas Globe and Mail had declared: ldquoA self-destructive madness grips the UK\".And it is not just Brexiteers who stand accused. Remainers and campaigners for a Peoplersquos Vote or a second referendum have been branded deluded and dangerous enemies of the people.Butwe have all taken leave of our senses, there may be a psychological explanation. And while research carried out in Scotland and published this week gives fresh insight into this collective act of self-harm, the original theories date back to the work of a Scottish journalist, poet and songwriter born  years ago and raised in an orphanage for Scots children in London.Charles Mackay is best remembered for his  book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, which is still cited today as one of the earliest studies of how large numbers of people can participate in very bad decisions.So what is the Madness of Crowds Mackayrsquos three-volume work highlighted examples of mass hysteria, from economic booms and subsequent busts such as the South Sea Bubble to witch hunts and the popular expectation that alchemists might one day turn base metals into gold. It looked to explain why large populations or communities sometimes embrace irrational beliefs and ideas, often in defiance of a blindingly obvious reality.ldquoWe find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object and go mad in its pursuit, Mackay wrote. ldquoMillions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.The theory has been much studied, including in a more recent work part inspired by Mackay, US journalist James Surowieckirsquos  book The Wisdom of Crowds, Why the Many are Smarter than the Few. Surowiecki argued that through sharing information, groups can make better collective decisions than any inidual within them could.But they canrsquot both be right The problem is there are good examples to support both theories, but we donrsquot know how or why \"collective wisdom sometimes works and sometimes goes badly wrong.That is why new research carried out at St Andrews University is so timely. It explains not only how collective madness can grip a population, leading to bad decisions, but also why the more complex the task, the more likely humans will act like animals, resorting to mimicry and \"groupthink\".According to lead author Wataru Toyokawa, postdoctoral research fellow at St Andrews University, the natural world can help explain a puzzle which has long troubled social scientists. \"Many people have studied how iniduals become more stupid when they behave collectively, he says. ldquoSeeking the opinion of others is normally beneficial,information gathering is good. We rely on that for the democratic process,\" he says. \"But it is a double-edged sword. Copying can be healthy butall the people are copying each other the system collapses.\"Along with Professor Kevin Laland of St Andrews School of Biology and PhD student Andrew Whalen, Toyokawa used an online experiment and population dynamics to explore the point at which the benefits of sharing information and collaborating to find solutions can tip over into a phenomenon known to psychologists as \"maladaptive herding\".Participants were given a iety of tasks and researchers discovered that the larger and more complex the task, the more likely people were to copy those around them, leading to poor decisions.\"With Brexit the task is very dficult because each inidual has dferent preferences, making it hard to reach consensus. In such a political situation, the danger is bad ideas can flourish,\" Toyokawa says.Whatrsquos happening to decision-making Over the years, research into Mackays ideas has consolidated around an understanding that conformity has a big influence on decision making. Soenough people believe leaving the EU will lead to a poundm idend for the NHS, or reduce overall migration rather than just the numbers coming from EU countries, others are likely to embrace the same ideas more readily, eventhey are irrational. This applies especiallythe suspect ideas chime with their own views or prejudices.Science writer Philip Ball is author of Critical Mass, which considers whether physics and chemistry can tell us as much about crowd behaviour as psychology and social science. This applies to physical crowds and traffic which can move about in ways which are similar to those of atoms in a confined space, he suggests, but can also apply to opinion formation.\"There is a large body of work highlighting the way that crowds can collectively make a good decision but can also reach a horrendously wrong one,\" he says.A good example is a \"guess the weight of the cake\" competition at a country fair. If people know what others have guessed there will often be a conformity effect, with people clustering their guesses close to one of those made earlier. But that earlier guess may be entirely wrong, distorting the outcome. Meanwhile, studies have found thatpeople guess \"blind\" in such a contest, averaging out their guesses usually provides a remarkably accurate estimate of the true answer. That is the wisdom of crowds.\"What this tells us is that once you start introducing interaction between people you are much more likely to find herding behaviour, reducing the chance of a good guess,\" Ball says.Social media and sophisticated online manipulation feed into the problemThe rise of the internet and social media has exacerbated the dangers, and polarised debate. This was perhaps seen most markedly in October  when the Supreme Court ruled against the UK Government, saying parliament should have a say over the triggering of Article .Newspapers suggested this was a clash between the courts and the populace, with the Daily Mail picturing the three judges who made the ruling, lined up like criminals mugshots, under the headline \"Enemies of the people\".This was the birth of the now widely-discussed view that any deviation from Brexit will be a betrayal of voters in the referendum. It was ridiculed by others as an extraordinary over-reaction to an entirely legitimate ruling from the English courts ndash which is where Brexiteers apparently want legal decisions to be made in future.Ball says. \"The questions now are about how these opinion dynamics play out when an overall bias in society can tilt things so markedly in one direction or another.\"Advertising does that but with social media you see it even more strongly. The echo chamber effect is huge, with people getting feedback from like-minded people. People repost ideas that tally with their own perceptions and fake news can spread like wildfire. Little things can set in train an avalanche effect.\"This is why we have representative democracy rather than plebiscites. If you dont have a robust system referenda are vulnerable because it only takes a small nudge to send people herding in a certain way.\"But it raises questions about how long democracy can continue to , he says, especially in light of the fact that many politicians have been slow to realise the game is changing.\"It isnt just huge billboards, it is the fact that a Cambridge Analytica can understand and predict the effects of targeting certain people, but they also know how to predict and manipulate them.Are we ants  Or bees In the insect world, the models for the wisdom of the crowd are creatures like ants and bees, both generally regarded as shining examples of collective decision-making. But bees have the edge, Toyokawa explains, and ants are more vulnerable to moments of \"madness\".\"Ants normally do very well. They copy and make very accurate decisions ndash for example when finding good food and a site for a nest. But sometimes a stupid ant can find a mediocre place. He or she may start advertising this option as good, and other ants react to that and follow.\"So the ants do really well when an environment is stable, but find it dferent to switch to a new environment. The honey bee generates collective intelligence very well, even in a changing environment.\"When the task is easy, humans behave more like a honey bee. When the group size increases and the task is dficult, we behave more like ants.\"Drting to the rightThis week Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the politan Police, warned Brexit could lead to another surge in far-right extremist groups, views and actions. The Brexit vote itself was followed by a surge in racist attacks, he pointed out, claiming that leaving the EU with no deal would be very bad for policing.\"We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum ndash thats never really receded. So theres always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere weve got at the moment,\" he explained.Toyokawa says group dynamics can explain how people on both sides are draw into face-offs in the street, or the heckling and harassment of politicians and journalists, when they would not otherwise be.\"Shouting in the street may affect other peoples decision-making ndash we dont know the answer to that. But the idea of maladaptive herding could certainly apply to demonstrations,\" the researcher says. \"People who might not usually get involved can end up copying the behaviour of others, just because they have seen there is a demo going on.\"This may be more a case of people being emboldened in their original views and prejudices, Ball says, as opposed to flocking mistakenly to bad ideas. \"There are ideas in some quarters such as the far right which are being played on and manipulated.\"Just as Donald Trump has to a degree legitimised racism in America,people see their views endorsed they can be emboldened.\"If people at the top say its OK to send out vans with messages on the side, there is the opportunity for people on the far right to manipulate the same sentiments. Im not sure you need a lot of psychology to explain that.\"And he warns that we can no longer ignore the increasing prevalence of such collective irrationality.\"We need to recognise these kind of dynamics in order to figure out what a democracy means and how it can operate in this networked age. Does it still have the same meaning \"The Madness of Crowds - three lessons from historyThe South Sea Bubble: Thousands of people invested in no-hope and sometimes fraudulent companies, in many cases losing their le savings.While encouraging people to invest in firms which promised profits from overseas trade which had little prospect of taking place, traders also engaged insider trading, while isions of the South Sea Company took money from those caught up in the speculation for wild projects ranging from paving the streets of London, digging for lead in Derbyshire and \"trading in hair\".The Dot Com Bubble: In the mid-s, investor fascination with the phenomenon known as the \"internet\" reached new peaks.

Secondly, the Scots and the Irish arenrsquot that important ndash wersquore ldquodferent ndash and finally, London is rendered an outsider because it just isnrsquot white enough.Just a few days before, I was speaking to Lord Kerr ndash once the UKrsquos leading diplomat, and the man who authored Article , the trigger mechanism for Brexit. Lord Kerr is a passionate Remainer, and one issue troubled him the same way it troubled me: that the vote to leave Europe was driven by English nationalism.Wherever you look now you see a political process harnessed to English nationalism. A few days ago Theran a piece suggesting ldquotherersquos one way for England to achieve Brexit ndash and thatrsquos by achieving independence from the UK.Therersquos a clear ldquoEngland First agenda at large. On the Today Programme, John Humphrys asks whether Dublin should leave Brussels, so the UK can gets its way over the Irish backstop. Instead of Dublin ldquotelling this country that we have to stay within the single market, therersquos an argument, says Humphrys, that Ireland should ldquoleave the EU and throw in their lot with this country. Itrsquos hard to think of a more absurd and arrogant proposal.Humphrys also says, as a matter of fact, that when ldquowe went to the polling stations to vote in the referendum hellip itrsquos unlikely that Northern Ireland would have been at the forefront of our minds. Did the Northern Ireland people ndash acutely aware of the risks to peace posed by a Leave vote ndash go blithely to the polls, in this England-centric world, not thinking of themselves  When Irelandrsquos Europe minister Helen McEntee told Humphrys that the UK Government had an obligation to protect the Good Friday Agreement, he told her she sounded ldquoa bit arrogant to a lot of people on this side of the Irish Sea.His comments came just a few days after dissident republicans planted a bomb in Derry. Perhaps, Humphrys should have reminded listeners that of the , people killed during the Troubles, more than  were British soldiers.Is this what an English nationalist Brexit looks like  Demanding Ireland kow-tow to England. Flagrantly disregarding and thereby endangering the peace process in Northern Ireland. Even forgetting dead veterans amid the delirium of Brexit. Do English nationalists not caremore young men from Bradford and Birmingham go and die in the Bogside and Ballymurphy  Because there is a very real risk that will happentheir hard border falls over the island of Ireland.Theresa May is now being pushed by extremists like Boris Johnson to secure changes from the EU on the backstop. It will be a ldquofreedom clause, says a man who has parlayed a career from lies, and cares about nothing but himself.Europe wonrsquot budge on the backstop, because Ireland wonrsquot budge on the backstop. Europe will stand by Ireland no matter what. This is what English nationalists need to learn: that their decisions leave them alone in a world where unity is paramount. It will be a cold place for little Englandersthey ever get their way, and that is what makes them so hard to understand ndash they would maim themselves and others to achieve what they see as a ldquowin.Sanity seems to be coming apart at the seams in the world of the English nationalist. Tory MP Mark Francois, of the European Research Group, lost it a few days ago when he all but chewed the microphone during a TV interview. Incensed by a letter from Tom Enders, the German chief executive of Airbus, warning about the catastrophe of Brexit, he proceeded to shred the pages live on air. Calling himself a ldquopatriotic Englishman, Mr Francois ranted about ldquoTeutonic arrogance before proclaiming his father was a D-Day veteran whorsquod ldquonever submitted to bullying by any German, neither will his son. The war still rages in the English nationalist mind.Meanwhile, the Government plans for martial law in the event of no deal, Jacob Rees-Mogg calls for the suspension of democracy, and tycoon Brexiters like James Dyson jump ship to Singapore.Scotland and Northern Ireland cannot be led to ruin against our will by the whims, nostalgia and reactionary fury of a hardcore cabal of English nationalists who have hijacked politics south of the Border.The Scottish independence movement is the polar opposite of what we see in English nationalism. There are no far right thugs, no threats of violence, no dangerous slurs like ldquoenemy of the people thrown around with revolutionary zeal, and little hatred ndash though personally I could do with less Saltires, marching and ldquoSaor Alba nonsense. Voting Yes was not an anti-English vote, it was a vote for a fairer, more positive and open world which Westminster was standing in the way of ndash sure, the Yes movement has its fair share of cranks and idiots, but those are mostly confined to the conspiracist corners of the internet.If the English nationalists seem set to get their way and drag Scotland and Northern Ireland out of Europe, against our will, like hostages in the boot of a car, then the only course of action is for the Scottish Government to move for an independence referendum at the earliest opportunity.

Headteachers are unable to plan ahead due to funding uncertainty and skilled staff are left in insecure positions, which will only make the major issues of teacher retention even harder to solve.ldquoThis is a paper-over-the-cracks arrangement by ministers. They know it does not compensate for a decade of funding cuts and the resulting loss of permanent teachers and additional support needs staff.\"Mr Greer called on the Scottish Government to end the \"hand to mouth\" funding arrangements for councils and schools.\"These posts, valuable though they are, are short-term only and so not guaranteed to be retained in future years. These posts were always intended to be additional resource on top of the existing teacher workforce, and cannot be viewed as a replacement for permanent teaching posts.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoWe would encourage local authorities to employ teachers on full-time contracts and have given an absolute commitment to the Attainment Scotland fund over this parliamentary session.ldquoThere is obviously regular turnover within the teaching profession. Vacancies arise and can be filled as and when they do and the arguments to make more of those posts permanent are compelling.ldquoWe are pleased however, to see progress made with the recruitment of  full-time equivalent teachers through the attainment Scotland fund. This contributed to the increase in teacher numbers of  we saw last year, which was a welcome increase to the teaching profession in Scotland.A spokesman for council umbrella body Cosla said: \"This is a perfect illustration of why the Pupil Equity Fund gives neither councils nor employees the security we need.\"It is short term funding which is only guaranteed until the end of this parliament and yet the services it provides have become an essential and core component of our work in improving attainment and closing the attainment gap.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a-genius-at-work-how-modern-technology-has-uncovered-more-details-about-leonardos-art-and-science","story":"Now the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci have come further under the microscope, revealing new details and new insight into his working for a new book which is to be published next month.Microscopy, ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography and X-ray fluorescencehave been used to study the finer details of his drawings in a publication which presents  years of scientic research by Alan Donnithorne, the former heard of paper conservation at the Royal Collections.He has focussed on  of Leonardos drawings, in a book, Leonardo Da Vinci: A Closer Look, which will mark the th anniversary of the artists death.Publication of the book will be followed by an exhibition at the Queens Gallery in Edinburghs Palace Holyroodhouse, from  November this year.The study reveals hitherto unseen or overlooked details: such as the inky fingerprints of the artist on a drawing of the cardiovascular system and organs of a woman, from around  .The thumb print is in the same reddish brown ink as the drawing.Changes to his compositions are also revealed, using infrared reflectography .Leonoardo used iron gall ink for his drawings, a pigment made from oak gall and iron salts that becomes transparent under IRR.In studies for the head of Leda, from -, the IRR analysis shows how he changed Ledas pose when he drew it in pen and ink, compared to his original pose in black chalk.A statement from the Royal Collections Trust adds: \"IRR imaging also shows that Leonardo sometimes drew without any underdrawing at all, his pen moving across the sheet of paper with complete fluidity, as in A man tricked by gypsies, c.

No mention of the need for a currency, a central bank, foreign currency reserves and a credit record for the borrowing that would be inevitable in the circumstances. No mention of the hard border at Gretna and the costs of that to our economy. All of these problems and more were highlighted in the SNPs own Inclusive Growth Commission Report, but no solution is proffered there or by Mr McKenna.While he makes much of the failures of Brexit, he misses the main lesson of that benighted project: that breaking up a union between and among states is fiendishly dficult. We see the shambles of breaking off from the EU after  years. How much more of a shamblestrying to disentangle a -year-old union  Brexit also shows how such ill-prepared adventurism can cause all sorts of splits in a society. Indeed, these splits were evident in Scotland during the  referendum campaign and we would not be free of them in a re-run, but Mr McKenna gives them no weight nor even any consideration.So it is possible to agree with him that the country is in a dficult place at the moment and that political leadership is noticeable by its failure. But it is not possible to see, and Mr McKenna has not made the case, that all or any of the problems we face would be improved by adding independence to the poisonous brew. Indeed, it is hard to see how independence would not increase our woes.Last week the First Minister prepared her supporters to go out and make the case for independence on the doorsteps. The problem for her and for them is that all the hard facts and evidence, including the SNPs own publications, show that there is no positive case for independence.

In a first-past-the-post Parliament I tend to agree. Holyrood, with its more proportional voting system, offers more leeway for the party of Government.The present SNP Government is struggling to get a budget through against unitedopposition . As a budget is an essential government , then it should let it be known that defeat would be a resignation issue. Give the disparate opposition parties their place in the sun, form a coalition government and enact the few policies they have espoused with the sources of funding they claim to have identied. The rest of us can kick back and watch the ldquofun.I think a new election would come pretty quick, but it would clear Scotlandrsquos political air and a give a new mandate for the winner. All good.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon, perhaps understandably, is impatient with Theresa Mays apparent inflexibility to sht from her Chequers Brexit proposal and offer a Plan B. There are, however, parallels with Ms Sturgeons own behaviour on constitutional matters.The SNP leader wont stray from her Plan A ndash strict adherence to nationalist dogma and independence. The people of Scotland of course voted against her in  and virtually every opinion poll since, predicts the same result. Yet Ms Sturgeon doggedly carries on, without a Plan B ndash she is determined we leave the UK, just as the UK is leaving the EU.Yet, in the medium term, she does have a Plan B of sorts. She knows her demand for another independence referendum will be rejected by Downing Street. Her Plan B is clearly to convert that rejection into a grievance to nurture until the next Scottish election.

And I donrsquot think his prediction will prove any more accurate now than ever in the last few decades.The charges which Alex Salmond is facing may be a problem for him, but it is not a problem for the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon has said unequivocally that plans for a new independence referendum will proceed as anticipated . Still less is it a problem for the grassroots independence movement, which by all reports is steadily gathering strength.As the Brexit fiasco descends into unimagined levels of sheer stupidity, and the two main Westminster parties display their incompetence more shamelessly by the day, the need for Scotland to escape from this morass could hardly be clearer.

It was there, hiding in plain sight.Worse still, when he looked at Mollyrsquos email account he realised that Pinterest - a site usually seen as the place where the middle classes gather images to help them design their homes - had been sending her automated alerts linking through to similarly disturbing material. ldquoIn the same way that someone who has shown an interest in a particular sport may be shown more and more posts about that sport, the same can be true of topics such as self-harm or suicide, Mr Russell said. ldquoThis one was sent after she died mdash therersquos a picture of self-harm on it. They were actually emailing her pictures of self-harm, so Pinterest has a huge amount to answer for.He is not the only bereaved parent who feels that way, with suicide-prevention charity Papyrus reporting a spike in calls to its UK helpline since Mollyrsquos story was reported last week. The callers, a spokeswoman for the charity said, were ldquoall saying the same thing, that social media had had a part to play in their childrenrsquos deaths.Given the complex layering of issues that surround any suicide, there can be no absolute certainty that such causality exists. Yet given that young lives are potentially being put at risk, the alternative - assuming there is no causality and taking no action as a result - would seem to be woefully inadequate. The problem is, in the absence of laws setting out what can and cannot be done online, working out what kind of action would be adequate is easier said than done.As things stand social media companies have their own policies in place for dealing with content that is deemed to be inappropriate, though as there is no unormity of approach it is easy to see how some posts can slip through the cracks. And, while Facebook executive Steve Hatch said he was ldquodeeply sorry that social media had been implicated in Molly Russellrsquos death, it is also clear that the site is loath to intervene in its usersrsquo activity, with Mr Hatch noting that it will not remove potentially distressing contentit appears to have been posted by someone looking for support from an online community. Instagram and Pinterest take a similar approach, although both have committed to reviewing their enforcement policies.Unsurprisingly Molly Russellrsquos father would like to see things go much further, and he has called for an independent UK regulator to be set up to ensure distressing material is removed from social media sites within  hours of being posted. Though health secretary Matt Hancock - who gained experience of the digital world during a two-year stint as a minster in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport - has made similar calls himself in the past, for now he has simply written to the main social media companies urging them to ldquopurge harmful content from their sites ldquoonce and for all.How successful this will be remains to be seen, with the onus at this stage being placed on the internet and social media providers themselves to, as Mr Hancock wrote, ldquoensure the action is as effective as possible. They have hardly shown willing in this respect in the past, with Facebook in particular being implicated as an enabler of peddlers of fake news, while the other main sites have come under fire for the apparently arbitrary way in which their rules are applied.And though Mr Hancock has warned that the Government will not be afraid to ldquointroduce new legislationit feels social media firms are flouting the demand that harmful content be removed, the parameters of that threat are so ill-defined it is hardly likely to result in serious action from either side. Meanwhile, without a universally accepted understanding of what harmful content is and what needs to be done to remove it, there will always be a danger that more children like Molly Russell will be able to access it.Given its relative newness and global reach the internet is often seen as a lawless place, but it doesnrsquot have to be that way. Dangling the threat of legislation in front of social media firms is one thing, but the Government could take action to ensure a rulebook is there for everyone to follow.

It was windy that night too and a lot of people who fly drones have told me it wouldrsquove been too windy that night to fly one.Keith Banks, an amateur meteorologist who writes a monthly weather column for the John OrsquoGroat Journal, says mphgusts were blowing during the period the UFO was witnessed.ldquoIn my view the very blustery conditions would have effectively precluded a drone from flying, he said.Dedicated drone flyers agree, including Barry Scollay from Wick who says he has been flying the unmanned aerial vehicles for a decade.ldquoNo way a drone would have flown in those winds ndash thatrsquos a certain fact, said Mr Scollay, who has a Facebook page called Highland Aerial Views which has over , followersldquoIt would have to have been able to maintain its location in high winds.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119314.jpg","title":"Trailblazers on right path","story":"MEMBERS of Wick Paths Group joined forces with Friends of the John OGroats Trail to improve a path used by walkers visiting the Castle of Old Wick.They got stuck in to the task of upgrading the narrow, muddy and uneven section from the old rle range to the field at the Grey Bools.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae.

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.”: Comment: Plan B votes could lead to deeper deadlockFormer Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said discussions had been taking place for “some days” between herself, health minister Stephen Hammond, and Solicitor General Robert Buckland on one side and Mr Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from the ERG on the other.Their plan involved a “recasting” of the Northern Ireland backstop as “free trade agreement-lite” with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland and an extended transition period to December .Former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, from the Brexiteer side, said the plan represented the “best hope” for the Conservatives.“I really urge the Government to embrace this because what this will tell the European Union is that now, I believe, a majority of Parliament, particularly in the governing party, have agreed there are compromises to be made,” he said.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said: “If the Prime Minister indicates in the debate that she will be pressing Brussels to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement to make changes to the backstop, I will gladly support the Brady amendment.“But what we need is to achieve something legally binding - and that means part of the Withdrawal Agreement.“We can’t have some codicil or letter or joint declaration. We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite Remainers and Leavers in the Conservative party and across the country.”DUP leader Arlene Foster gave her party’s support to the Malthouse Compromise.“We believe it can uny a number of strands in the Brexit debate including the views of Remainers and Leavers,” she said.“It also gives a feasible alternative to the backstop proposed by the European Union which would split the United Kingdom or keep the entire United Kingdom in the customs union and single market.“Importantly, this proposal would also offer a route towards negotiating a future trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.“If the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on.“There is no better time to advance this alternative given the confusion and disarray which is now manesting itself in Brussels. This has been displayed both by the contradictory EU statements and the panic-stricken behaviour of the Irish government.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863642.1548688494!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots is a language and not slang alistair heather","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A new study of Glasgow Scots finds that child immigrants learn how to speak it, but also pick up on the idea that some view Scots as #slang# and therefore not appropriate for certain situations, writes Alistair Heather, who says it#s time to #breenge intae  wi a bit mair smeddum whan it comes tae the Scots language#.Being told to “speak proper”, having your language mocked on national TV and derided as incomprehensible across the UK and the world. This is the typical fate of the speaker of Glasgow Scots, the Glaswegian dialect of the Scots language. These prejudices have contributed to a complex pattern of ‘code-switching’ in which a speaker might use Scots with friends, but move along a language continuum towards Scottish Standard English when in a classroom, a job interview or talking on the phone.You could imagine newcomers to the city and country struggling to navigate this linguistic quicksand. ‘Yes’ and ‘aye’ are commonly used in the city, but pinning down precisely where, when and how to use one over the other would be a tricky lesson to teach, let alone assimilate into practise. Yet according to a recent study by Dr Sadie Ryan of Glasgow University, young migrants to the city are adopting not only elements of the Scots language, but are quickly learning how to code-switch like native speakers based on their audience.Dr Ryan was first put on to the linguistic challenges migrants to Glasgow faced when working with asylum seekers. They were studying English textbooks but very quickly realising that the patterns explained in the book were not those being spoken outside. “Words like ‘aye’ and ‘cannae’ were common in the streets outside but went unexplained in the textbook,” she said.To investigate the ways in which young migrants adapt to this linguistic environment, Dr Ryan went to a high school in the East End of Glasgow. It is a working-class area that until very recently had low immigration and a close-knit linguistic community which had sustained a relatively dense Scots lexis in common usage. Since the expansion of the EU in , the area has seen a marked increase in migration from Eastern Europe, with concomitant impact on the demographics in the classroom.: Pupils to be taught Scots language in bid to improve attainmentThe study looked at language, and also specically at code-switching. This is something we as Scots do all the time, ying our accent and vocabulary to match with our perception of what is ‘proper’ for each situation.To gain insight into code-switching, the kids were recorded in three dferent social situations to see how they responded linguistically to dferent listeners. An after-school club was set up, where the kids were free to play and joke with their pals. They did loads of activities like drums, make-up, arts and crafts. They were equipped with headset mics to capture the audio. Then they were recorded in conversation with Dr Ryan, a more formal setting. Finally, they were recorded in the classroom doing school work.The Glasgow Scots features Dr Ryan was looking out for were things such as Scots negation. That is words such as cannae, wilnae, dinnae, didnae, saying “I’m no daein that” as the equivalent of the standard English “I’m not doing that”. Dr Ryan was also looking at glottal stops. This feature – the ‘dropping’ of the t in the middle of words – is actually fairly complex. “Although people can see it as an absence, it involves the contraction of the vocal cords to create a distinct sound, so is better seen as alternation between dferent sounds. Its use too is complex. It can only replace t-sounds when they occur in very specic places in speech, yet no language learning textbook will tell you which places it can occur in.”The results from the after-school club were interesting. When wearing a mic, the kids would spend five minutes tearing about, putting on funny voices and kidding on they were American. When they began to settle down, however, it was clear that, amongst themselves, these young immigrant and Glasgow-born kids, living and learning together in a working-class part of Glasgow, were using Glasgow Scots features regularly in their conversations. Regardless of the country of birth of the children, Scots negation and glottal stops were common.The after-school club also revealed examples of the newcomer pupils’ mother tongues contributing to the linguistic repertoire of the group. For example, a wee guy with a Polish girlfriend had learned “I love you” in Polish. And a group of pals – Polish, Lithuanian and Scottish – would use bits of Scots, bits of Polish, bits of Scottish Standard English to communicate. Dr Ryan witnessed during this part of the study a lot of effort from the Glaswegian-born kids to integrate with and welcome the newcomers, which is great to hear.The second and third parts of the study – the interviews and the recordings made in the classroom setting held with the pupils – were also revelatory. The ability of non-Scottish born pupils to code-switch between Scots and Scottish Standard English was as good as their Scottish-born classmates.: Do you know these  Scots words and phrases Conversations with pupils of ious backgrounds revealed that they saw the Scots words as being ‘slang’. For example, saying ‘aye’ is the slang for ‘yes’. This is less positive news as it does seem to indicate that prejudices about the Scots language are being transmitted along with its vocabulary and usage.The Scots language is spoken by around . million people, according to the  census, yet bizarrely it has little or no place in many schools outside of Burns Week. The impact of this lack of legitimacy in school is perhaps seen in the attitudes of the pupils learning and using the words who see it as of lower status. Dr Ryan saw pupils with negative perceptions of their own voice, with one saying “I wish I had a dferent accent” and another that “we don’t really speak proper round here”.This study has revealed that Scots plays an important role in the social integration of newcomers into the school environment. It is also playing a role in identity formation.As this is the  United Nations Year of Indigenous Languages, it is a great time to reassess and improve our national relationship with the Scots language. Excellent studies like that conducted by Dr Ryan can reveal the importance of Scots to our identity and its centrality in our everyday communication. It would be a positive to investigate further the role of Scots in social integration and look at ways to use it to boost linguistic confidence both in and out of the classroom.More positive still would be for us just to learn to speak it with confidence ourselves, to take away the strange cringe or shame some of us have about these native words, this language o oor national bard an the language o oor scuils the day. Let’s breenge intae  wi a bit mair smeddum whan it comes tae the Scots language, whitiver dialect ye speak.Dr Sadie Ryan’s new language podcast Accentricity is available on podcast apps and at accentricity-podcastAlistair Heather is on Twitter @historic_ally©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863346.1548678893!/image/image.jpg","title":"something has to give if brexit is going to be delivered brian monteith","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Yvette Cooper#s amendment will not make an agreement on the backstop any more likely, writes Brian Monteith Another week and another Westminster clfhanger. This time it is whether or not the government’s motion on its Plan B for Brexit, up for discussion tomorrow, will be successfully altered by an amendment lodged by Labour Remainer Yvette Cooper. If passed the effect will be to give Parliament the power to bring forward a proposal to extend Article  for possibly three months – even until the end of this year.Whatever the outcome, the fact is thatthe UK is to leave the EU with a transitional arrangement then something needs to give for Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to become acceptable or it will not be passed. With Parliament having invoked Article  of the Lisbon Treaty and passed the Withdrawal Act the existing law is simple. If there is no alternative procedure made law then the United Kingdom leaves at pm on  March and immediately becomes a sovereign country again, trading under World Trade Organisation rules rather than EU regulations on a supposed temporary basis.Last week was notable for a number of statements from all sides seeking to find agreement that might deliver the referendum result – even before Her Majesty suggested the importance of establishing common ground. First Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson, who have been appealing for the Prime Minister and her Cabinet to stick to past commitments, indicated they could be willing to support her Withdrawal Agreementshe can get the EU to time-limit or even delete the ‘backstop’. Given there is a great deal more wrong with the Prime Minister’s proposal than just the backstop this was a generous concession. Their real concern is that without finding some consensus Brexit will never happen. Yet, as the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, demonstrated on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, a compromise on the backstop will not come from the Irish Republic. To win such a prize would therefore require the EU having to hang out Ireland – either by agreeing to previously dismissed technical solutions it has insisted are unworkable or by moving the ‘border’ to the continental mainland such as the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge . Irish politicians have every right to be worried about being hung out to dry following statements from the EU’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas and then its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Schinas caught the Irish by surprise and set hares running by stating at a media briefing there would indeed be a “hard border” between the Republic and the UKno transition arrangement could be agreed. This was completely at odds with what EU Commission President Jean Claude Junker had said when last visiting Dublin. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was then reported as suggesting a risk that the EU might choose to locate border checks away from the Irish border and to the French and Dutch ports, thus treating the UK and Ireland as a single block. For those believing it could never happen the example of Ireland and the UK being outside the Schengen Area and therefore sharing joint security and passport checks provides a dose of reality.Varadkar was not finished, for when pressed on the border issue later in Davos he claimed Irish police or even the army would have to man any hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If the comment was designed to panic the UK government into concessions it was a misjudgment for the response was, as it has consistently been, that the UK would not install or operate any physical border infrastructure or controls. It is only the EU and Irish politicians who are now talking about physical infrastructure. What they misunderstandis not that Brexit-supporting Unionists say there will be no border, they say there is indeed a border already for many thingsbut it is essentially invisible and should remain so.If the UK ends up trading under WTO rules, using the past experience and already existing technology means we shall be able to work invisibly for trade, even including animals and foodstuffs, by managing any checks before and after the border – just as already happens in other parts of Europe. That Varadkar, Coveney, Barnier – and British politicians who support remain – cannot admit to recognising solutions exist, when an endless number of papers and articles have been produced showing how an invisible trade border can work, suggests they either choose to remain ignorant or are intentionally mendacious.What is also missed is that existing EU regulations are not impervious to fraud and deceit and cannot be bettered. Such arrogance and complacency was exposed as dangerously naïve during the  Irish horsemeat scandal, when some Irish-made burgers were found to have up to  per cent horsemeat in them when labelled as pure beef.The problem with Cooper’s amendment remains that delaying the departure date for Brexit will not in itself make arriving at an agreement on the border or other obstacles any more likely. MPs shall simply be taking the pressure off both themselves and the EU and end up with nothing much happening for the next three months – ing to a flurry of brinkmanship and suggested compromises as the clock ticks down again to pm on say,  June or even the end of December. We thus have two paradoxes. The first is how the backstop insisted upon by EU and Irish politicians to avoid an imagined hard border is now proving to be the most likely cause of the UK leaving the EU without a transition agreement – so a hard border is delivered. The second is that the approach of the last few days and hours of time left for negotiation – before the UK concedes there will be no agreement and WTO trading rules must be put in place as the expected outcome – is what is resulting in a drive by all parties to find a solution. Take the imperative of the clock ticking down removes the pressure to find a solution.Yvette Cooper’s amendment needs to be rejected and the focus of politicians on all sides shouldto improving the Withdrawal Agreement so that it becomes acceptable to all parties – or acknowledging it will indeed be a very bad deal the UK cannot work with and instead move to improve the circumstances for leaving the EU without a transition agreement.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Speaking at the official opening, Lord Mayor Councillor Julie Flaherty said, “Thanks to an investment of £,, outdoor play provision in the village is now on a par with other upgraded sites across the borough. In addition to providing contemporary new play equipment, brightly coloured safety surfacing has been installed and fencing has also been erected to secure the site.“Of course, credit must go to members of the local community and school children who engaged with us during the design process and gave their views on choice of play equipment.”Lord Mayor, Cllr Julie FlahertyRe-Opened

Our hard-won peace process and its political architecture have too often been taken for granted.We may have peace, but we have not seen enough progress.When over  Irish citizens from the north signed an open letter to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in December  it came at the end of a tumultuous and politically defining year.That January the Good Friday Agreement political institutions collapsed amidst the political and financial scandal of RHI.It served to confirm the growing view of northern nationalists that political unionism was not committed to proper power-sharing through the denial and refusal of equality, rights and respect towards the section of the community to which we belong, rights such as: access to justice marriage equality: language rights.It would seem that there can be no regulatory alignment on this island, and Bangor must be as British as Finchley, unless you are gay and want to be married or seek to live a le through the medium of Irish with statutory protection.This contempt mobilised the nationalist and republican electorate: in turn the unionist political majority in the Assembly was ended.Increased unionist belligerence continued, and then, the nationalist constituency sent a stark message during the subsequent Westminster election, that it was turning its back on Westminster.However, the political process in the north had already been seriously destabilised due to the result of the EU Referendum in , when a majority of people in the north voted to remain in the EU.The British government ignored that democratic result and the emerging negative implications of Brexit became major talking points across the island.Every report and expert assured us that there will never be a hard border in Ireland and that the Good Friday Agreement was constitutionally sacrosanct as an internationally binding agreement. Yet, within the past week, we have been told by Theresa May that the Good Friday Agreement is up for negotiation and the European Commission have confirmed that a no-deal Brexit will bring a hard border in Ireland and yesterday Leo Vardakar advised the World Economic Forum that there may be soldiers on the border.This culmination of events and concerns motivated me and others to make the first direct public appeal in late  to Leo Varadkar to stand up and speak out in defence of Irish citizens# rights in the north.We felt it was essential that Irish citizens in the north heard reassurance from the Irish Government that the reality of abandonment experienced by our parents and grandparents would not be visited upon our generation.The back page of your programme today carries an assurance from the Taoiseach that: “To the nationalist people in Northern Ireland, I want to assure you that we have protected your interests throughout these negotiations. Your birth right as Irish citizens, and therefore as EU citizens, will be protected.There will be no hard border on our island. You will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.”This assurance cannot simply be a historical quote.It must be a living commitment.It must mean that there can be no hard border on our island.That my children will not have to endure the ignominy of being stopped at Newry or Derry, when travelling to Croke Park for a match, or to Donegal for a holiday.One of the objectives of this conference today is to assert to the Irish Government that we are their citizens, bearing their passport and that we insist on our full access to citizenship, but rights, human rights are for all.No citizen in the north should endure a diminished sense of their citizenship as a result of Brexit. Everyone benefits when rights are protected, and all traditions and communities are respected and valued.Today’s conversation is about all of that. We seek to provide a space for a discussion to begin.It has to begin somewhere. And when we are told that now is not the right time, I ask then when is the right time. So,not now, when Nelson Mandela once observed that, “If you wait for textbook conditions they will never occur.”We believe this is the right time to have a conversation about the future. Failure to encourage and embrace that potential would be reckless and irresponsible.In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.Our children and new generations deserve a future better than the past which we endured. I wouldn’t have believed you, had you said a few short months ago that my small club [Naomh Éanna] would be in an All-Ireland final in two weeks time, but the unexpected can overtake events.I have seen how history and identity, timing and preparation and the taking of opportunity can reshape history and positively define and improve lives.Tapaidh an déis.

It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pm ready to reopen eu negotiations in bid to win mps support","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country  — Boris JohnsonJanuary , But the chances of the Commons derailing her plans were also heightened when Labour confirmed it will back a cross-party bid to push Brexit day back from March  to as late as the end of this year and put Parliament in the driving seat on the way forward.This proposal, tabled by Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, is one of the strongest-backed of a bevy of rival amendments tabled for debate. Only those selected by Speaker John Bercow will go forward to a vote.Mrs May is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening.Speaking to Cabinet, she said she aims toto the Commons “as soon as possible” with a revised deal, which will be subject to a “meaningful vote” of MPs. If it is defeated, she will table another amendable motion for debate the following day.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  If no new deal is reached by February , the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Her announcement brought the prospect of the cancellation of Parliament’s half-term recess a step closer, as the Commons is currently due to rise for its -day break on February .Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, struck by Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and signed off by leaders of the remaining  EU states last November.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the EU was waiting to see what happened in Parliament.“This is not a Brussels day, this is a London day. We have the vote tonight and then we will take it from there,” he said.And Ireland’s European Affairs Minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned: “There can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.”But Mrs May’s official spokesman said: “There is a very clear message from the EU’s leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.”Mrs May told Cabinet that a majority for the Brady amendment would send three vital messages to the EU by:– Making clear that the will of the House of Commons is to leave with a deal– Setting out in no uncertain terms that the UK continues to be committed to arrangements which avoid a hard border in Ireland and– Creating scope for new discussions with the EU on how best to achieve that.“The Prime Minister said that in order to win the support of the House of Commons, legal changes to the backstop will be required,” said Mrs May’s spokesman. “That will mean reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.”Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs May on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment.But it was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the  Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs May’s deal on January .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  MPs rejected Theresa May’s EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of  votes earlier this month The leader of the European Research Groupof eurosceptic backbenchers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, initially said its members were not prepared to support the Brady plan, though he later appeared to soften his line.Remain-backing Tories may rally behind the Cooper Boles amendment, while other proposals may gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labour’s Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party.Drawn up in meetings co-ordinated by housing minister Kit Malthouse, the compromise recasts the backstop as a “free trade agreement-lite”, with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border and an extended transition period to December .DUP leader Arlene Foster – whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration in the Commons – said it provided a “feasible” alternative to the backstop.“If the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on,” said Mrs Foster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Former minister Nicky Morgan has been involved in talks on the so-called ‘Malthouse compromise’ Mrs May’s spokesman said the PM “welcomes the fact that MPs are working together to come up with solutions”, but declined to pass judgment on the Malthouse compromise.Remain-backing former minister Nicky Morgan said discussions had been taking place for “some days” between herself, health minister Stephen Hammond and Solicitor General Robert Buckland on one side and Mr Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from the ERG on the other.“The Prime Minister has been aware of the discussions.

There is an obligation on people to actually have pragmatic solutions rather than wishful thinking.\"He said Ireland \"will insist\" the UK keeps its word to the people of Northern Ireland and the way to overcome the obstacles was through the future relations talks during the transition period.\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government rejects mays bid for brexit backstop concessions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said he wanted to try to get a general election, he tried that and failed. “It seems to me it’s incumbent on Labour to make its position on this clear –it does so then I do think there would possibly be a majority in the House of Commons so Labour, at the moment, are the block to that and I think that’s deeply regrettable. “We’ll have to wait and see what Labour’s position would be.

That remains the case. “Obviously Labour have to be willing to work with the SNP as well as the SNP being willing to work with Labour. “Until now the blockage to working together like that has come from the Labour side but I would always do whatever I could as leader of the SNP to keep the Tories out of Downing Street.”"},{"url":null,"title":"liverpool fan 8 overwhelmed by clubs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder.

Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card.

She suffered from the heart condition Tricuspid Atresia.Mrs Trainor has described the decision to send babies to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool after the provincersquos paediatric pathologist retired as ldquoinhumane.She believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.In addition, Mrs Trainor believes the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting, Mrs Trainor described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service, knowing that a senior pathologist was retiring.ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le, she said.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country  mdash Boris JohnsonJanuary , But the chances of the Commons derailing her plans were also heightened when Labour confirmed it will back a cross-party bid to push Brexit day back from March  to as late as the end of this year and put Parliament in the driving seat on the way forward.This proposal, tabled by Labourrsquos Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles, is one of the strongest-backed of a bevy of rival amendments tabled for debate. Only those selected by Speaker John Bercow will go forward to a vote.Mrs May is expected to have phone discussions with key EU leaders over the course of the day, with votes taking place in the early evening.Speaking to Cabinet, she said she aims toto the Commons ldquoas soon as possible with a revised deal, which will be subject to a ldquomeaningful vote of MPs. If it is defeated, she will table another amendable motion for debate the following day.If no new deal is reached by February , the PM will make a statement to Parliament that day and table an amendable motion for debate the following day.Her announcement brought the prospect of the cancellation of Parliamentrsquos half-term recess a step closer, as the Commons is currently due to rise for its -day break on February .Brussels has been adamant that it will not reopen the Agreement, struck by Mrs May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and signed off by leaders of the remaining  EU states last November.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the EU was waiting to see what happened in Parliament.ldquoThis is not a Brussels day, this is a London day. We have the vote tonight and then we will take it from there, he said.And Irelandrsquos European Affairs Minister, Helen McEntee, cautioned: ldquoThere can be no change to the backstop. It was negotiated over  months with the UK and by the UK. A bit of realism is needed at this stage.But Mrs Mayrsquos official spokesman said: ldquoThere is a very clear message from the EUrsquos leaders that they want the UK to leave with a deal and that they understand this is in the best interests of the EU as well as the UK.Mrs May told Cabinet that a majority for the Brady amendment would send three vital messages to the EU by:ndash Making clear that the will of the House of Commons is to leave with a dealndash Setting out in no uncertain terms that the UK continues to be committed to arrangements which avoid a hard border in Ireland andndash Creating scope for new discussions with the EU on how best to achieve that.ldquoThe Prime Minister said that in order to win the support of the House of Commons, legal changes to the backstop will be required, said Mrs Mayrsquos spokesman. ldquoThat will mean reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.Tory MPs were told at a meeting with Mrs May on Monday evening that they would be whipped to support the Brady amendment.Butit was far from clear whether this instruction would be followed by enough of the  Conservatives who rebelled against Mrs Mayrsquos deal on January .MPs rejected Theresa Mayrsquos EU withdrawal deal by a record margin of  votes earlier this month The leader of the European Research Groupof eurosceptic backbenchers, Jacob Rees-Mogg, initially said its members were not prepared to support the Brady plan, though he later appeared to soften his line.Remain-backing Tories may rally behind the Cooper Boles amendment, while other proposals may gain cross-party support, including a plan by Conservative Caroline Spelman and Labourrsquos Jack Dromey to rule out a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, a compromise drafted by Conservative MPs from both the Remain and Leave sides of the party won the crucial backing of the Democratic Unionist Party.Drawn up in meetings co-ordinated by housing minister Kit Malthouse, thecompromise recasts thebackstop as a ldquofree trade agreement-lite, with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border and an extended transition period to December .DUP leader Arlene Foster ndash whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration in the Commons ndash said it provided a ldquofeasible alternative to the backstop.ldquoIf the Prime Minister is seeking to find a united front, both between elements in her own party and the DUP, in the negotiations which she will enter with the European Union, then this is a proposition which she should not turn her back on, said Mrs Foster.Former minister Nicky Morgan has been involved in talks on the so-called lsquoMalthouse compromisersquo Mrs Mayrsquos spokesman said the PM ldquowelcomes the fact that MPs are working together to come up with solutions, but declined to pass judgment on the Malthouse compromise.Remain-backing former minister Nicky Morgan said discussions had been taking place for ldquosome days between herself, health minister Stephen Hammond and Solicitor General Robert Buckland on one side and Mr Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker from the ERG on the other.ldquoThe Prime Minister has been aware of the discussions. At some point there has to be compromise on all sides in order to get a deal over the line. That is what most of us want to see ndash a negotiated settlement with the EU, she said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM ready to reopen EU negotiations in bid to win MPs u support article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing.
