For Gilbert’s voyage of self-discovery captured the zeitgeist. Described as ‘a Shirley Valentine for the yoga and quinoa generation’ and compared to Sex And The City’s Carrie Bradshaw ‘cut loose from New York’, Gilbert’s story struck a chord with women dreaming of escape.Some followed in her exotic footsteps, enjoying pizza in Italy (Eat), finding spiritual enlightenment in Indian ashrams (Pray) before travelling on to Indonesia hopefully to fall into the arms of their own sexy ‘Felipe’ under the Banyan trees of Bali (Love).Raised on a Christmas tree farm in Connecticut, Gilbert was a moderately successful writer when, aged 34 and reeling from a painful orce, she set off on her solo odyssey across three continents to try to make sense of her life.         Gilbert and Elias held a non-legally binding commitment ceremony in New York prior to her death. Gilbert and Elias had been best friends for years but their relationship turned romantic after the cancer diagnosisWriting on the tenth anniversary of the bestseller which turned her into a multi-millionaire, Miss Gilbert wrote: ‘The woman who went on this trip was exceedingly lucky …Who has 12 free months to spare, just to kick around the globe? Who has the freedom or the money?’She continued: ‘One of the reasons I was so free that year was because I was such a mess. It was easy for me to leave everything behind because I didn’t have much to leave behind.‘I had no property because I’d lost it all in my orce. I had no romantic relationships, because I’d exploded them. I had no job because I’d quit. Everything was in turmoil, everything was in flux and I was so bloody sad.’Reflecting on the tangled love life which triggered the odyssey, Gilbert wrote in 2015 with disarming honesty about her past romantic failings, under the heading Confessions Of A Seduction Addict.‘Seduction was never a casual sport for me it was more like a heist, adrenalising and urgent. I would plan the heist for months, scouting out the target, looking for unguarded entries,’ she wrote.‘Then I would break into his deepest vault, steal all the emotional currency and spend it on myself. If the man was already involved in a committed relationship, I knew that I didn’t need to be prettier or better than his existing girlfriend I just needed to be different.         Gilbert announced in September 2016 that her marriage was over and that she’d found love with her best friend of 17 years —Rayya Elias — a musician, writer, film maker, recovered drug addict, ex-punk rocker and former hairdresser whom she’d first met when Elias staged an ‘intervention’ on Gilbert’s hair (Above: the pair pictured together in 2014)‘The trick was to study the other woman and to become her opposite, thereby positioning myself to this man as a sparkling alternative to his regular life.’Although Miss Gilbert set off on her voyage, swearing she will ‘never, ever, under any circumstance, marry again’, in 2007 she did marry her exotic, older lover ‘Felipe’, Jose Nunes.Together they set up an Asian imports emporium in New York called Two Buttons, and for ten years the glamorous couple seemed blissfully happy, living in Frenchtown’s most expensive house — built for New Jersey’s first native-born governor. ‘My marriage has been pretty f****** nice. Pretty steady,’ she said shortly before their shock break-up.‘I always think about how, at the very beginning, he said: “Can you please be gentle with me?”, and I remember thinking: “You, sir, have come to the right place.” ’In a long Facebook message to her fans, Gilbert announced in September 2016 that her marriage was over and that she’d found love with her best friend of 17 years —Rayya Elias — a musician, writer, film maker, recovered drug addict, ex-punk rocker and former hairdresser whom she’d first met when Elias staged an ‘intervention’ on Gilbert’s hair.‘Rayya and I are together. I love her and she loves me,’ wrote Gilbert, adding that she realised the depth of her feeling for Rayya only when her best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic and liver cancer.‘Something happened to my heart and mind in the days and weeks following Rayya’s diagnosis,’ she continued. ‘Death — or the prospect of death — has a way of clearing away everything that is not real and, in that stark and utter realness, I was faced with this truth: I do not merely love Rayya I am in love with Rayya. And I have no more time for denying that truth.’Jose Nunes has never spoken of his orce from Gilbert. Their Frenchtown mansion was listed for sale for $999,000 dollars, the New York shop sold and last October the couple’s two-bedroom apartment on a Wellness resort in Miami, Florida was listed for sale for $2.3 million dollars.In an interview with a lesbian magazine about inspiring same-sex couples, Rayya Elias revealed she and Gilbert were ‘very happily not married’ but had gone through a non-legally-binding ceremony of their commitment to one another.Describing their ‘slow burn of passion’ after ‘almost two decades of the deepest foundational friendship you could ever imagine’, Rayya said: ‘It took a long time. Then I was diagnosed with cancer, and that did it. There was no more time to waste. The truth had to be spoken.’After Rayya’s death in January 2018, Elizabeth Gilbert posted this tribute: ‘She was my love, my heart, my best friend, my teacher, my rebel, my angel, my protector, my challenger, my partner, my muse, my wizard, my surprise, my gift, my comet, my liberator, my rock star … and my baby.‘I loved you so much, Rayya. Thank you for letting me walk with you right to the edge of the river. It has been the greatest honour of my life. I would tell you to rest in peace, but I know you always found peace boring. May you rest in excitement. I will always love you.’Today, a happy new chapter now appears to be opening for Elizabeth Gilbert — with the friend of the late best friend whom they both loved.No doubt, her fans will be eagerly awaiting her next surprise.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Blue Planet Live viewers shocked seagull snatches baby turtle yards oblivious host","story":"Share this article She said: \u0027Traumatised by the seagull picking up and walking off with a turtle hatchling as your broadcaster spoke to camera about the importance of preservation and protecting them from predators!\u0027BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker jokingly compared the scene to tonight\u0027s season premiere of Line Of Duty.He said: \u0027 Line Of Duty is always top drawer but Jed Mercurio is going to have to come up with something special to beat the drama of the seagull and the baby turtle from Blue Planet Live.\u0027                                             Social media immediately exploded with hundreds of stunned people sharing their collective at the mortifying clip - with one of the audience even claiming to be \u0027traumatised\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/03/31/04/11674526-0-image-a-4_1554002110273.jpg","title":"Mick Jagger flashes smile recuperates Miami","story":"Make like Georgia May in a floral mini dress by Isabel MarantFind it at Farfetch!Georgia May Jagger\u0026#39s beach style is another level of luxe.

While MPs have yet to unite behind any alternative Brexit plan Mrs May will have to plan for a possible majority on Wednesday, with a customs union looking most likely. If so she will have to decide whether to accept a policy opposed by the vast majority of Tory MPs. If she agrees, the issue could tear the party apart. If she refuses, it would result in a constitutional stand-off that could spark an election. Downing Street fears that she could face a Cabinet walkout regardless of what she decides.            Theresa May faces a battle to keep control of Brexit as MPs vote on alternatives to her deal toniWednesday: Sir Oliver Letwin will try to seize control of the Commons agenda again to pursue his soft Brexit plan. A cross-party group of MPs is publishing a bill which would require Prime Minister Theresa May to put forward a proposal to extend the Brexit process beyond April 12, preventing a No Deal departure in 10 days\u0027 time. The single-clause bill is being tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper, with the backing of senior MPs including Hilary Benn, Dame Caroline Spelman, Jack Dromey, Dominic Grieve and Norman Lamb.Thursday: Allies of the PM have the day pencilled in for a possible fourth attempt to get her deal through the Commons. They believe that, with the majority against her coming down from 230 to 149 then to 58 last week, they have momentum on their side. Ministers are considering an unprecedented parliamentary \u0027run off\u0027 pitting Mrs May\u0027s deal against the soft Brexit option chosen by MPs in the hope of focusing the minds of Tory eurosceptics.What happens next? What will the EU do next?  An emergency summit will be held on April 10. Britain can use this to ask for a longer delay to Brexit - perhaps to the end of the year or even longer.Mrs May has told MPs a long delay will mean holding European Parliament elections on May 22.  What is No 10\u0027s plan? Mrs May is ploughing on for now. Downing Street is insistent the deal remains the best way of securing an orderly Brexit and appears set on another vote at some point.  No 10 may now consider whether to call a snap general election if MPs try to pass laws to force May to pursue their option next week. Will May go for a long extension or No Deal? Nobody knows for certain. The Prime Minister has publicly ruled out personally going for a long extension but also admitted Parliament will rule out No Deal.Will May resign now her deal has failed again? Again, nobody knows for sure. Her announcement on Wednesday night that she would stand down was contingent on the deal passing.In practice, it drained Mrs May of all remaining political capital. Most in Westminster think her Premiership is over within weeks at the latest. As her deal folded for a third time on Friday, she faced immediate calls from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn so stand down with instant effect. What is clear is there is already a fight underway for the Tory leadership.  Does is all mean there will be an election?Probably, at some point. The Commons is deadlocked and the Government has no functional majority. While the Fixed Term Parliaments Act means the Government can stumble on, it will become increasingly powerless.Mrs May could try to call one herself or, assuming she stands down, her successor could do so.  Would May lead the Tories into an early election? Unlikely. Having admitted to her party she would go if the deal passes, Mrs May\u0027s political career is doomed.While there is no procedural way to remove her, a withdrawal of political support from the Cabinet or Tory HQ would probably finish her even if she wanted to stay.    How is an election called? When would it be? Because of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act passed by the coalition, the Prime Minister can no longer simply ask the Queen to dissolve the Commons and call an election. There are two procedures instead.First - and this is what happened in 2017 - the Government can table a motion in the Commons calling for an early election. Crucially, this can only pass with a two-thirds majority of MPs - meaning either of the main parties can block it.Second an election is called if the Government loses a vote of no confidence and no new administration can be built within 14 days.In practice, this is can only happen if Tory rebels vote with Mr Corbyn - a move that would end the career of any Conservative MP who took the step. An election takes a bare minimum of five weeks from start to finish and it would take a week or two to get to the shut down of Parliament, known as dissolution - putting the earliest possible polling day around mid to late May. If the Tories hold a leadership election first it probably pushes any election out to late June at the earliest.  Why do people say there has to be an election? The question of whether to call an election finally reached the Cabinet last week.Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay warned the rejection of Mrs May\u0027s deal would set in train a series of events that will lead to a softer Brexit - meaning an election because so many MPs will have to break manifesto promises. MPs voting to seize control of Brexit from ministers has only fuelldd the demands.   Labour has been calling for a new vote for months, insisting the Government has failed to deliver Brexit.Mr Corbyn called a vote of no confidence in the Government in January insisting the failure of the first meaningful vote showed Mrs May\u0027s administration was doomed. He lost but the calls did not go away. Brexiteers have joined the demands in recent days as Parliament wrestles with Brexit and amid fears among hardliners promises made by both main parties at the last election will be broken - specifically on leaving the Customs Union and Single Market. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen wants Mrs May replaced with a Brexiteer. He believes it would push Remain Tories out of the party and then allow a snap election with more Eurosceptic candidates wearing blue rosettes.What might happen? Both main parties will have to write a manifesto - including a position on Brexit. Both parties are deeply split - in many cases between inidual MPs and their local activists.Under Mrs May, the Tories presumably try to start with the deal. But it is loathed by dozens of current Tory MPs who want a harder Brexit and hated even more by grassroots Tory members. Shifting Tory policy on Brexit to the right would alienate the majority of current MPs who voted to Remain.Labour has similar splits. Many of Labour\u0027s MPs and activists want Mr Corbyn to commit to putting Brexit to a second referendum - most with a view to cancelling it. Mr Corbyn is a veteran Eurosceptic and millions of people who voted Leave in 2016 backed Labour in 2017. The splits set the stage for a bitter and chaotic election. The outcome is highly unpredictable - the Tories start in front but are probably more ided on the main question facing the country.Labour is behind but knows it made dramatic gains in the polls in the last election with its promises of vastly higher public spending. Neither side can forecast what impact new political forces might wield over the election or how any public anger over the Brexit stalemate could play out.It could swing the result in favour of one of the main parties or a new force. Or an election campaign that takes months, costs millions of pounds could still end up in a hung Parliament and continued stalemate. This is the current forecast by polling expert Sir John Curtice.  The Tories need to get on with Brexit and learn to believe in Britain again"},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan visit Ilapothecary herbal boutique practises ancient belief Numerology","story":"Share this articleHow Denise Leicester created a skincare business after treating the ruler of Dubai - TelegraphA Moment with Meghan Markle | EyeSwoon"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman kicks dog head STAMPS families park","story":"               A woman is seen yanking on the leads of the dogs she is looking after.

Photograph: Alan BetsonFile photoThe all-male society in Trinity College Dublin (TCD) at the centre of a controversy over hazing allegations has defended practices in the club, following “misleading” reporting, the group has said. In a statement, the Knights of the Campanile said media reports on an initiation ceremony that took place for new members “are not to be taken too seriously”. TCD is investigating if any alleged hazing occurred at the initiation, which recently took place in the student residence of the society’s president, Ben Arrowsmith, and was first reported by the University Times (UT) last month. Peter Ledbetter, master of the near-century old society, said he had been assured that “bullying andor humiliation played no part” in the evening. The UT reported that society members were being jeered and shouted at, and that gagging and retching sounds could be heard from within the apartment.A member of the Knights of the Campanile present in the apartment at the time told The  that new members had been told to eat butter, and at another point had to get into a running shower with an umbrella.The invite-only society accepts 50 new inductees each year based on their sporting prowess, and boasts 1,200 members, including honorary members.The statement from Mr Ledbetter, a prominent business figure and former Trinity tennis player, said media reports had been “somewhat misleading and improper”.“The Knights are described as a ‘secret society’ which, very obviously is not true. Woodward and Bernstein would, I’m certain, have uncovered our society’s website within minutes,” he said. There was a implication of gender bias in descriptions of the club as all-male, which was “misleading journalism,” he said. Journalists “should be aware the Knights have a sister college society in the all-female Heraens,” the statement said. However, it is understood this society, for women involved in college sports, has been dormant for several years. Descriptions of the Knights as an elitist group were also unfair, Mr Ledbetter said. “Knights are an elite in the same sense that scholars can be described as an elite. Both are appellations earned through excellence,” the statement said.‘Bugged’ TCD is also investigating an allegation that the UT “bugged” the apartment of Mr Arrowsmith during the alleged hazing. Reporters from the newspaper covertly placed a recording device by the open door of the apartment. Mr Ledbetter said the actions of the UT involved “trespass, invasion of privacy, and bugging,” and had “disturbing implications for the privacy rights of all students”.Following the story, more than 500 students signed a petition which has led to a referendum being announced, which could lead to the effective closure of the newspaper, by dramatically reducing the funding it receives from TCD students’ union. The Knights of the Campanile had no role in the petition to slash the newspaper’s funding, Mr Ledbetter said. “Some have sought to represent this petition as an attack on ‘freedom of the press’ but my understanding is that it actually arose from disquiet with the University Times’ trespass, invasion of privacy, and bugging,” he said. Editor of the UT, Eleanor O’Mahony has rejected accusations of bugging, and the National Union of Journalists has defended the reporting as “consistent with the highest professional standards of public interest, investigative journalism”.Honorary members of the society include Ronnie Delany, George Hook, and Trinity Provost Prof Patrick Prendergast.

Image: iStock.About 1,000 women have had to be recalled to repeat their smear tests because of the massive backlog in the screening programme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has said.As a result of the delays, some samples expired before they were transferred to slides for testing, and repeat testing was required in about 1,000 cases, it says. Affected women and their GPs have been contacted by the CervicalCheck cancer screening programme.Women are now having to wait up to 33 weeks for test results from the time they had their smears, up from 27 weeks at the start of the year, according to the latest HSE figures.This is the longest delay yet recorded since the CervicalCheck programme was overwhelmed by additional requests for smear tests last year. The normal processing time was four to six weeks.The backlog currently stands at just under 80,000, and average processing times are also at their longest since the current crisis began. Almost 350,000 screening tests were carried out during last year. There are usually about 250,000 cervical screening tests each year. Laboratories processing the slides for CervicalCheck believe a temporary suspension is the only feasible way of clearing the backlog, though the screening programme has been trying to source additional capacity overseas.The issue is becoming critical because slides are approaching their expiry dates.An alternative solution is to introduce HPV testing, which is more accurate than traditional smear tests. However, the HSE says it needs to “stabilise” the screening programme by eliminating the backlog before this type of testing can be introduced.Labour has called on Minister for Health Simon Harris to explain why women paying privately for smear test results get them in a fraction of the time, from the same lab, as women whose tests are carried out under the CervicalCheck programme."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Christopher Redmond was last year found guilty of sexual assault of granddaughterKnights of Campanile rejects characterisation as secretive or elitist amid \u0026lsquobugging\u0026rsquo rowResistance to Government request to est Catholic patronage in north DublinAlmost 80,000 patients waiting up to 33 weeks for results of CervicalCheck screeningSport Ireland will appear before Oireachtas committee on WednesdayChild\u0026rsquos nose repaired under general anastheticbut there was no disfigurementChanges to Local Property Tax have been deferred for one yearChase lasted almost an hour before man was detained by garda\u0026iacute just outside PortlaoiseMinister says calls for his resignation after policing comments are matter for the TaoiseachOne in four people know of an autistic person among their friends, research revealsMediterranean rescue mission tested training and boosted payExplainer: Persistence of common external tariffs may run counter to reason for leavingTaoiseach to discuss EU single market and open Border with Macron and MerkelParents and sons accepted under family reunification but daughter refused due to ageAudit acts on allegations that children\u0026rsquos teeth were damaged by HSE orthodontic servicesCost of corrective action poses challenges for owners\u0026rsquo management firmsCalls for McGrath to resign after claiming drink-driving checks were \u0026lsquoover the top\u0026rsquoDrivers crossing into Northern Ireland without correct documentation risk fines"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846861.1554208026!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fai has not explained 100 000 loan from john delaney committee to hear","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFAI executive vice president John Delaney adjusts his tie during Ireland’s Uefa Euro 2020 qualifying match against Georgia at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on March 26th. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireSport Ireland will tell an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday that the FAI has not sufficiently explained the circumstances of a €100,000 loan given by John Delaney to the organisation in 2017.An opening statement to the committee from John Treacy, the chief executive of Sport Ireland, reveals that the FAI responded to a letter from the organisation which was sent after the loan was revealed in recent weeks.“However, the contents of the FAI letter did not sufficiently explain the circumstances of this loan and its repayment, nor fully address the matter of compliance with Sport Ireland’s Terms and Conditions of Grant Approval.”Under these conditions, the FAI was obliged to notify Sport Ireland in writing of any material deterioration in its financial position, or any other matter which could jeopardise the its overall financial viability.Sport Ireland has again written to the FAI “re-seeking clarification on the circumstances of this loan”.“More detail was also requested by Sport Ireland in order to assess compliance with the terms and conditions of grant approval. Sport Ireland also sought re-confirmation that all state funding provided to the FAI has been spent for the purposes intended and in accordance with approved submissions”.The FAI is yet to reply to the second letter, Mr Treacy will tell the committee.Sport Ireland will also flag that it was not told in advance about the “structural changes” at the FAI which centred on John Delaney’s resignation as chief executive and re-assignment as executive vice-president and the appointment of Rea Walshe as interim chief executive. It was not consulted in the preparation of a report on governance by Jonathan Hall \u0026amp Associates which informed the changes, and has not yet received a copy of the report. Mr Treacy’s opening statement also reveals that Sport Ireland last year raised questions with the FAI about their 2017 liquidity position. This was brought about after the FAI introduced a €1.3 million bank overdraft facility, and an increase in its net debt position in 2017. Responding to the query, the FAI’s director of finance told Sport Ireland that the organisations net current liabilities position “is a common annual position” driven by deferred income from grants, sponsorship and commercial agreements being released over the lifetime of the agreements.He said that the “the overdraft position at Dec 2017 was within our overdraft facility with our banking partners and was a matter of timing rather than a liquidity concern - the balance has been in credit for the majority of 2018 to date”.

File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe The UK government is under pressure to clarify immigration rules that human rights activists say undermine the rights of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said changes in UK immigration laws treating people in Northern Ireland automatically as British citizens (or British subjects) “goes against the grain” of the 1998 agreement underpinning the Northern Irish peace process.He was referring to the changes to immigration rules published on March 7th but highlighted this week by citizens’ rights campaigner Emma DeSouza, a Northern Ireland-born Irish citizen embroiled in a lengthy appeals process after her US-born husband’s application for residence was rejected.The UK changed the definition of a European Economic Area national in the rules last month stipulating that dual British nationals who are British by birth will not be considered an EEA national in the UK.Ms DeSouza said the change reaffirmed “a worrying trend” of Northern Ireland-born Irish citizens are going to be “among the only EU citizens within the UK unable to access their EU rights and entitlements”.She argues that this is significant because the UK government has taken the position that all people of Northern Ireland are British by birth under the British Nationality Act 1981, a presupposition that, she says, “goes against the Good Friday Agreement right to be Irish or British or both as you so choose”.The Co Derry woman says that Irish citizens or dual Irish-British citizens in Northern Ireland cannot apply for “settled status” as EU nationals in the UK after Brexit. If they could, this would, under the UK’s proposed orce deal, provide them with “a legal security blanket” to protect their rights.“So what is happening is the government is imposing blanket British citizenship on the people of Northern Ireland and removing our access to EU rights through this process,” she said.“This creates in essence two tiers of Irish citizens: those that can retain their EU rights and those that can’t.”‘Hiding contradictions’The Department of Foreign Affairs said the Government was continuing to engage with the UK Government “to ensure that the important citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are upheld in all relevant policy areas and in all scenarios.”Ms DeSouza’s husband applied to live in Northern Ireland in 2015 as the family member of an EEA national living in the UK.The UK Home Office initially refused the application on the basis that his Co Derry-based wife applied for the visa as an Irish national, which as a dual citizen disqualified her.Her husband challenged the decision, arguing that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the 1998 agreement and was exercising her freedom-of-movement right as an EU citizen.The couple won but the Home Office is appealing the decision and a hearing has been delayed until the UK is due to leave the EU. Ms DeSouza fears further changes with Brexit, particularly in light of the trend reflected in the new immigration rules that she noticed in recent days.Mr Allamby called on the UK government to outline further details of the review British prime minister Theresa May promised on the identity rights of citizens when she visited Belfast in February.“We would call on the government to issue the terms of reference and a timetable for the review as quickly as possible in order to resolve questions of family reunion in Emma DeSouza and other cases,” he said.Brian Gormally, director of Northern Irish human rights group Committee on the Administration of Justice, said that Brexit has opened up “a legal reality” that the UK has not legislated to protect the rights of Northern Irish citizens under the Belfast Agreement.“Brexit has peeled away some things that have been hiding contradictions in British law relating to the Good Friday Agreement,” he said.Daniel McCrossan MLA, the SDLP’s Brexit spokesman, called on the UK government to address the immigration rules and “commit to conforming with the spirit and letter of the Good Friday Agreement”.“These rules, which redefine EEA citizenship as contradictory to British citizenship, and further define those born in the North as automatically British, fly in the face of the guarantee that all those born here can identify as Irish, British or both,” he said.Twenty years after Good Friday we examine the Belfast Agreement and ask is it still fit for purpose?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3846633.1554202346!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elaborate checks on goods crossing border necessary in no deal brexit barnier","story":"Speaking in Brussels, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier says there has to be a “positive vote” by the House of Commons in order to avoid a cliff-edge Brexit on April 12th. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier said it ‘would be the responsibility’ of the UK government to choose between leaving without an agreement or seeking an extension. Photograph: Slawomir KaminskiAgencja GazetaReuters Elaborate and extensive checks on goods and animals crossing the Irish Border will be necessary in a no-deal scenario, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated on Tuesday. But where such checks will be remains unclear.Speaking at a Brussels think tank, he said, “we need to find the way somewhere to implement the checks. We’re working with Irish Government to know where we can apply these checks.”“We have to implement everywhere, at each and every external border of the EU three types of controls to protect consumers, food security, animal disease, to protect the budgets of the EU and national budgets, so the fiscal controls for VAT and customs controls, and serve to protect businesses against counterfeiting and ensure the goods entering the EU are meeting standards.“This is the pre-condition to avoid any kind of controls inside the single market. That’s why we need to find the way somewhere to implement the checks. We’re working with the Irish Government to know where we can apply these checks but I will not elaborate on this point today.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will have talks with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Tuesday, and with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin on Thursday, with plans to protect the single market up for discussion.Mr Barnier echoed comments on Monday by the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt warning that British MPs were facing a last chance to break the deadlock – as things stand, the UK is on course for a no-deal departure on April 12th. He was speaking before British MPs rejected four options for a new way forward on Brexit in indicative votes on Monday night.Three optionsMr Verhofstadt said that any demand from London for a long extension to article 50 would have to be justified to EU leaders before they would agree to it. “Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU, therefore a strong justification would be needed,” he said, specifying that would have to mean a commitment to a new approach.There might be three options: “A new political process, I don’t know what kind of process we’ll see, that gets a majority. The second one would be organising a new referendum and the third one would be national elections. It could be a justification for a long extension of the negotiation to give the UK time for one of these three options.”He reiterated that the withdrawal agreement remains the only deal on the table. “If the UK still wants to leave the EU in an orderly manner, this agreement is and will be the only one. The only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit is and will be through a positive majority.“There is a possibility of a successful meaningful vote in the coming days. Still the House of Commons did not manage to find a majority again last night in its second round of indicative votes. We will continue to follow how the process unfolds in the UK.”“We always said we can accept a customs union or our relationship along the style of the Norway model. The political declaration can accommodate this today. It leaves the door open for a variety of outcomes. We’re prepared to rework the political declaration as long as the fundamental principles of the EU are accepted,” he said.“If UK parliament doesn’t vote in favour in the coming days only two options remain. Leaving without an agreement or requesting a longer extension of the article 50 period. It would be the responsibility of the UK government to choose between these two options.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His customs union proposal was rejected by 276 votes to 273. Photograph:  Jessica TaylorUK Parliament via ReutersWhat were the results?The motion on a customs union, put forward by the Tory veteran Ken Clarke, lost by 273 votes in favour to 276 against. This was a slight improvement: the majority against the plan last week was six. A cross-party motion for a “common market 2.0” fell by 21 votes (261 to 282) a call for any final deal to be put to a referendum lost by 280 to 292 and a plan to give MPs the power to extend Brexit, or at least choose between no deal or revoking article 50, lost by 191 to 292.Were there any surprises?Yes and no. There had been no definitive expectations of any measure reaching a majority, but proponents of the customs union and common market 2.0 plans had been hopeful – the former because the margin of defeat had been so small last time, the latter because Labour changed its stance to whip in favour of the idea.What sunk the two close-run plans?In the customs union vote, joining the vast majority of Conservatives in the no lobby were a mix of people for whom the plan was not Brexity enough (the DUP, some Labour leavers) and those for whom it was too hard a departure (the Lib Dems, the Independent Group). Some remain-minded MPs abstained.The common market 2.0 plan suffered from a similar mix of opponents, and worries about the idea of not ending freedom of movement led 25 Labour MPs to defy the whip, mainly those in leave-voting areas. Another 33 Labour MPs abstained.Are MPs ever going to agree on anything?Who knows? The expectation had been that a looming no-deal departure – now due in 11 days’ time – would focus minds, build bonds and prompt compromises. But that has yet to happen. Focus will now turn to a possible third round of indicative votes, perhaps on Wednesday. Jeremy Corbyn, responding to the results in the Commons, called for this course of action, saying that if it was “good enough for the PM to have three chance at her deal”, then the same should go for MPs.Does this mean Theresa May’s plan is back on?It never went away, at least not as far as the government is concerned. Despite having put the deal (or in the last case, half the deal) to the Commons three times and losing by 230, 149 and 58 votes respectively, it seems likely MPs will get a fourth go later this week. Responding to the results, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said May’s plan was the only viable option left, given that the Commons had rejected leaving without a deal and cancelling Brexit. But with the DUP and Tory hardline Brexiters still adamant that they cannot back the plan, it still appears unlikely that it will pass.Who’s going to be most pleased by this?The MPs pushing the alternative plans are certainly not so chipper – the Tory Nick Boles resigned the party whip after his common market 2.0 plan was defeated, saying the government had refused to compromise.Theresa May could take grim pleasure from MPs trying to “seize control” of the Brexit process amid much criticism of her supposed incompetence and then proving just as unable to find a way through the weeds. She also now does not face the immediate choice that would have come from a positive vote for a softer Brexit: embrace this and lose half her cabinet or reject it and go for no deal, thus losing the other half. A couple of Brexit-minded MPs had even indicated that if May pushed for a customs union, they might vote with Labour on a no-confidence motion to bring down the government.But she still faces an intractable decision, a ticking clock, a mutinous party, an aghast British public and a frankly baffled EU. So what happens next?No timetable has yet been agreed. The cabinet is meeting on Tuesday morning for what will be a hugely important gathering, even by the standards of recent weeks and months. It seems we can then expect a new vote on May’s deal later in the week, and perhaps more indicative votes.Will this mean a long delay to Brexit, and UK participation in EU elections?Given parliament’s strong opposition to no deal, this is looking more likely. According to officials close to the Brexit negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day, the UK could still leave by May 22nd – the set departure date if May’s deal is passed – if the Commons orders Downing Street to negotiate a customs union. However, the Commons has not done this. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Ms Takahashi reportedly worked more than 105 extra hours in a single month.Government figures show that deaths from overwork occur most frequently in the transportation and postal sectors, followed by wholesale, retail and manufacturing, with most victims reportedly in their 40s.The new overtime cap is one of three key pillars of labour reform masterminded by Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, who is grappling with a rapidly aging, shrinking workforce in addition to a culture of overworking.The introduction of the new labour law coincides with a major shift in Japan’s immigration policy, with a new visa system also launched on Monday opening the doors to more foreign workers.Please review our commenting policyBrexit vote latest news: Emmanuel Macron says EU will not be \u0026#39hostage to crisis in the UK\u0026#39 and warns Article 50 extension is not a givenParents who refuse vaccinations for their children are putting us all at riskBenefits of landmark HIV drug outweigh risks of birth defects, study showsWinston Churchill\u0026#39s \u0026#39naughty document\u0026#39 carving up Europe with  Stalin to go on display Analysis: Why Britain cannot rely on an Article 50 extension to solve the Brexit impasse London theatre: the best plays and shows on nowMexican musician kills himself \u0026#39to declare his innocence\u0026#39 over sex harassment allegationsFive-minute nose job in sight thanks to new electrical \u0026#39reshaping\u0026#39 methodSaudi Arabia is \u0026#39paying large monthly sums to Khashoggi\u0026#39s children\u0026#39Male doctors accused of sending female medics unsolicited naked pictures amid BMA #metoo momentComment: Labour\u0026#39s support for freedom of movement betrays its Leaver heartlandsCommon Market 2.0: What is it, and how does it differ from a customs union?Neo-Nazi who plotted to kill Labour MP is a convicted paedophile who tried to groom two schoolboysComment: Is Britain now hurtling towards no deal?

Saudi Arabia retains a culture of “blood money” payments where the families of convicted killers make payments to the families of victims. Saudi officials denied that the houses or payments were designed to buy the Khashoggis’ silence and said that it was a normal practice for the kingdom to support any citizens who had been through a tragedy. Khashoggi’s children have been restrained in their public comments and none have directly accused Crown Prince Mohammed of orchestrating their father’s killing, a suspicion held by the CIA and a number of US senators. Saudi Arabia strongly denies that the Crown Prince was involved in the killing.Salah Khashoggi, the journalist’s son, was summoned to the royal palace last year and the government released photographs of him meeting with both King Salman and the Crown Prince. The family declined to comment on the payments. Saudi Arabia has put 11 people on trial for Khashoggi’s murder but the proceedings are taking place in a secret court and it remains unclear who the defendants are and what charges they are facing. Prosecutors have asked for the death penalty for five of the suspects.Saudi Arabia has rebuffed international calls for a more transparent legal process.  Those put on trial accused of the killing in Istanbul last year are believed to be mainly be members of the security forces.Saud al-Qahtani, a former aide to Crown Prince Mohammed and the man believed to have organised the killing, has not been charged.  Mr Qahtani denies involvement in the murder.Brexit vote latest news: Emmanuel Macron says EU will not be \u0026#39hostage to crisis in the UK\u0026#39 and warns Article 50 extension is not a givenRecord numbers of amputations on NHS amid warnings 1 in 10 will soon suffer type two diabetes Parents who refuse vaccinations for their children are putting us all at riskNew labour law puts limits on Japan\u0026#39s overworking culture   Benefits of landmark HIV drug outweigh risks of birth defects, study showsWinston Churchill\u0026#39s \u0026#39naughty document\u0026#39 carving up Europe with  Stalin to go on display Why Britain cannot rely on an Article 50 extension to solve the Brexit impasse London theatre: the best plays and shows on nowMexican musician kills himself \u0026#39to declare his innocence\u0026#39 over sex harassment allegationsFive-minute nose job in sight thanks to new electrical \u0026#39reshaping\u0026#39 methodMale doctors accused of sending female medics unsolicited naked pictures amid BMA #metoo momentComment: Labour\u0026#39s support for freedom of movement betrays its Leaver heartlandsCommon Market 2.0: What is it, and how does it differ from a customs union?Neo-Nazi who plotted to kill Labour MP is a convicted paedophile who tried to groom two schoolboysComment: Is Britain now hurtling towards no deal?

It’s initial assessment recommended a functional split between accountants’ auditing and consultancy arms but the MPs recommendations go further.Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: For the big firms, audits seem too often to be the route to milking the cash-cow of consultancy business.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armathwaite Hall hotel in Keswick, Cumbria holds Lemoga classes with the lemurs from Lake District Wild Life Park, who were mingling with the class to create a personal yoga experience which aims to heighten the sense of wellbeing for both lemur and human.

The client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I\u0027m now calling that the market has bottomed and the so-called crypto winter has come to an end, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial advisory firm deVere Group.I believe bitcoin will now move higher over the next few weeks and months, making steady gains for investors. As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, this will have a positive impact on prices in the wider crypto sector... I think we could reasonably see the bitcoin price hitting $7,000 in the next few months.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOther cryptocurrency experts have urged caution over the sudden price surge, given the notorious price volatility associated with bitcoin.Bitcoin has shown, once again, its trading resilience and a potential to shake off the \u0027moderately bearish\u0027 tag some analysts had put on it at the start of 2019, said David Futter, a fintech partner at the law firm Ashurst.Nonetheless, substantial volatility remains in the crypto market generally, something which the increasing regulatory scrutiny from global governments is unlikely to dampen in the short term at least.CoinMarketCap)Bitcoin is currently trading at its highest value since November 2018, though it is still a long way off its late 2017 peak of $20,000.After its incredible price explosion 18 months ago bitcoin experienced a sudden price crash before months of steadily declining prices.Bitcoin trader brutally tortured with drill in cryptocurrency robberyCryptocurrency mystery deepens as $143m goes missingBitcoin\u0027s value has remained relatively stable in recent months, making its sudden price surge all the more notable.It is not yet clear what caused the market turnaround but it comes as several major technology companies are taking steps to either develop their own cryptocurrency or integrate bitcoin into their existing platforms.Bitcoin could be about to turn back up again in a more meaningful way, said Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Exchange.At a time when central banks have exhausted themselves with the unprecedented printing of money to keep sentiment running high and the global economy afloat, over a decade after the crisis of 2008, it would seem a peer-to-peer decentralised currency, with limited suppply and an attractive technology that it rests on, could be a compelling alternative option.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearCryptocurrency markets are\u0026nbspnotoriously volatile and it is difficult to pinpoint price swings to a specific incident.Some\u0026nbspmarket analysts suggest such a jump could help kick start more gains for bitcoin in the year leading up to its next ‘halvening’ – an event taking place every four years where the rewards for mining the digital currency are reduced by 50 per cent.Twitter boss Jack Dorsey buying $10,000 in bitcoin each week“Although there are no clear cut reasons for the sudden movement, it is reasonable to suggest that bitcoin has hit its bottom as we are almost 400 days away from the next halvening,” Danny Scott, chief executive of Isle of Man cryptocurrency exchange CoinCorner, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“This is price behaviour we have seen before previous halvenings and is something we believe to be an emerging pattern for bitcoin.”Breaking above the $4,200 price is also seen as significant by some cryptocurrency experts, who believe it could precede a positive price trend for bitcoin.Earlier this week, bitcoin analyst Simon Peters, who works for the online trading platform eToro, said that investors were “eagerly awaiting” to see if it broke above this price point.“Bitcoin has failed to break this ceiling so far in 2019, and therefore this price movement would be significant,” he said.“However, investors should hold their horses, as only once we’ve seen a break and, importantly, the price stays above $4,200, can people perhaps start to turn bullish for the long-term.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Humanity might be about to see a black hole for the first ever time.The announcement relates to the Event Horizon Telescope, the European Southern Observatory announced, which is said to have found its first result. That telescope has been capturing data for more than a decade in an attempt to take a photo of the edge of a black hole, the first time one would ever have been seen by human eyes.Scientists have been attempting to take images of\u0026nbspSagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole that lurks in the middle of our galaxy.Black holes are by their very nature impossible to see, since they swallow up all light and so make it impossible for any to reach us on Earth.

Britain’s continuing descent into a deep pit was all over his morning’s business and economic news.\u0026nbspTake the MarkitCIPS survey of manufacturing as your starter for ten. It was up at 55.1, against 52.1 the previous month, with anything above 50 constituting an expansion. That ought to be good news. Trouble is, it was driven by manufacturers racing to complete orders and stockpiling like it’s going out of fashion.

The shares slumped, losing more than 8 per cent of their value as the market took fright. \u0026nbspIt’s worth considering a point made by Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon in response. “The group isn’t doing a great deal wrong,” he opined, and he’s right. It isn’t.\u0026nbspIts struggles are partly down to higher fuel costs. That counts as more or less expected turbulence. Brexit, however, has left it flying into the middle of a violent hurricane.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just airlines that are faced with doing that as a result of the fools sitting around the cabinet table, whose sole current focus is in courting the ageing bigots in the Conservative\u0026nbspParty’s membership now that a leadership contest is looming.A case in point could be found in the form of Liz Truss, who is supposed to know a thing or two about the economy in her role as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\u0026nbspIf she does there was scant sign of it in her appearance on BBC Radio Four’s Brexit show, formerly known at the Today Programme, on which she declared she had “no fear” of no deal.\u0026nbspThe British Chambers of Commerce, the Institute of Directors, the CBI, the vast majority of their respective members, they all view that like a triple dose of the Exorcist in 3D.\u0026nbspBut Truss isn’t interest in interested in what people who understand economics, and how economies actually work, think or say. Nor are a depressingly large number of her colleagues who also like to burble on about their love for free trade. As for real people with real jobs and real mortgages? Who cares about them.

It’s initial assessment recommended a functional split between accountants’ auditing and consultancy arms but the MPs recommendations go further.Committee chairwoman Rachel Reeves said: For the big firms, audits seem too often to be the route to milking the cash-cow of consultancy business.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armathwaite Hall hotel in Keswick, Cumbria holds Lemoga classes with the lemurs from Lake District Wild Life Park, who were mingling with the class to create a personal yoga experience which aims to heighten the sense of wellbeing for both lemur and human.

The client relationship, and the conflicts of interest which abound, undermine the professional scepticism needed to deliver reliable, high-quality audits. Splitting audit from non-audit business would be a big step to boosting the culture of challenge needed to deliver high-quality audits.We must not wait for the next corporate collapse. Government and regulators need to get on and legislate to deliver these reforms and ensure that audits deliver what businesses, investors, pension-holders and the public expect.Auditors have come in for criticism after a number of large companies have gone bust without the accountants who checked their books highlighting problems.The business committee also raised questions about the dominance of the big four which check the books of 97 per cent of Britain’s largest listed firms. The Business Committee recommends using joint audits for the most complicated cases. This would mean multiple accountants sharing work on a single company’s accounts.In addition, it wants to reduce the number of consecutive years a company can stay with the same auditor from 20 years to seven. After this there would be a cooling-off period of three years during which the auditor cannot offer consultancy services to the client. Some auditors have been accused of developing “cosy” relationships with certain clients that hampered their ability to properly scrutinise the management’s accounts. The committee also took aim at Britain’s fifth-largest accountancy firm Grant Thornton which audited cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Chief executive David Dunckley informed the Business Committee that it was not part of Grant Thornton’s role to look for fraud during its audit of the company.A £40m hole in Patisserie Valerie’s accounts was subsequently uncovered by forensic accountancy work carried out by a different firm.Ms Reeves said that “change in the audit market is long overdue”. The \u0027Big Four\u0027s\u0027 dominance has fostered a precarious market which shuts out challengers and delivers audits which investors and the public cannot rely on.Our report proposes a range of measures to boost competition, improve the audit product, and ensure that the UK continues to be a world leader in corporate governance.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black.

And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science.

Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong.

Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Waters said: “Top Boy is a raw, real representation of street culture. It explores how these characters came to make the choices they\u0026nbspmake,\u0026nbspand gives the audience a behind-the-scenes look as to what is happening on our streets today. It needs to be talked about and the show doesn’t shy away from giving us the platform to tell our story. We can’t change things if we do not acknowledge it and understand it first. Netflix is the perfect platform for this show, there aren’t many networks who would be brave enough to keep it this real.”On the Assassination Vacation tour, Drake is his own worst enemyDrake pays tribute to Nipsey Hussle at O2 Arena showDrake drops Michael Jackson track from setlist as UK tour kicks offThe series also features musical artists\u0026nbspLittle Simz\u0026nbspand Dave, while Shone Romulus returns as Dris and Ashley Thomas returns as Jermaine.\u0026nbspNew cast members include Lisa\u0026nbspDwan, Jasmine\u0026nbspJobson,\u0026nbspKadeem\u0026nbspRamsay, Saffron Hocking, Kola\u0026nbspBokinni and Hope\u0026nbspIkpoku.The story will follow Dushane\u0026nbspas he returns from exile to his home in London to reclaim his throne in the drug market.\u0026nbspHe teams up with Sully, his\u0026nbsppartner and sometime rival, who has been released from prison.

But increasingly self-driving cars are just one of many innovations we are likely to see on our roads. The Government\u0027s new Future of Mobility: Urban Strategy sets out how it will plan for their introduction.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, many families are seeking to home educate because of mental health issues or bullying. These parents argue that their children feel less safe in mainstream education.Still, local authorities in England have been repeatedly calling for more powers to ensure that the rising number of children taught at home\u0026nbspreceive a good quality of education away from school.I introduced GCSEs in the 1980s – but now it’s time to scrap themThe latest call comes amid reports that some parents are being pressured by schools to home educate just before their children’s GCSE exams, leaving families without education provision during a vital period.In cases like this, the argument for more regulation is strong since it should\u0026nbspensure that pupils who are “off-rolled” – the process of moving pupils off a school register informally – do not miss out on education altogether.However, there is plainly a difference between parents who feel pressure to home educate in these circumstances, and families who have voluntarily opted out of the mainstream system with a plan in place.Many home educators argue that there is simply not enough quality provision in place for children with special educational needs at a time when schools and local authorities have faced cuts.The large rise in home schooling is a concern – but not because thousands of children are at risk or radicalisation or other dangers. The growth in home education is a worry because it reflects a significant dissatisfaction with the state school system.A register is a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem. Greater funding and reduced pressure over\u0026nbspexam results is needed to stem the flow\u0026nbspof children out of state school education. \u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

This dramatic jump is likely to attract many investors who have been sitting on the sidelines.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearSince launching in 2015, six years after bitcoin, Ethereum\u0026nbsphas seen remarkable growth due to its functionality, which extends beyond just being an alternative payment system.Like Bitcoin, Ethereum relies on the same underlying blockchain technology that means it is decentralised and does not rely on traditional financial institutions like banks to function.But beyond being a virtual currency,\u0026nbspEthereum\u0026nbspwas designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts\u0026nbsp– which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and run without the need of a third party.‘Bitcoin Jesus’ predicts ethereum will be most valuable cryptocurrencyThis means it aims to not just decentralise banks but decentralise the entire internet.Its utility has led some industry experts to speculate that Ethereum\u0026nbspcould one day surpass bitcoin as the world\u0027s leading cryptocurrency.Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus the value, of bitcoin, Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast April. This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.Ethereum\u0027s recent gains may give investors hope that it can fulfil such expectation,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspthough it still remains a long way off bitcoin – and a long way down from its $1,400 peak from January 2018.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. How sugar might be inhaled is not made clear in the study, published in the journal Nature Immunology.Theoretically sugar could be “snorted” as a powder, but not “vaped”. When a sugar solution is heated the water evaporates while the sugar crystallises.The study in mice looked at specialised white blood cells called macrophages. These act as immune system “vacuum cleaners”, removing harmful organisms and debris.The Manchester team found that macrophages in the lungs need the right level of glucose “fuel” in order to function properly.Exposure to chemicals in the womb may reduce lung function in childrenToo much sugar stimulation led to inflammation of the type often associated with chronic conditions such as asthma.Lung inflammation is also linked to the potentially deadly effects of parasitic worm infections, a huge problem in Africa and Asia.The research suggests that blocking sugar receptors on lung macrophages could help suppress such diseases.On the other hand, stimulating the cells with more sugar might help the immune system fight off bronchial infections responsible for coughing fits and pneumonia.Prof MacDonald added: “Respiratory illnesses cause terrible suffering in both the developing and developed world.\u0026nbspHundreds of people are admitted to hospital every day in the UK with asthma attacks, while potentially deadly parasitic infections in the lungs are endemic across much of Africa and Asia.\u0026nbspThe idea that modifying glucose levels in the lungs could one day be a critical factor in treatment of these conditions is tremendously exciting.“Clearly we now need to study the impact of glucose on human lung macrophages.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

That collapse, unimpeded by Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government, was devastating even by the standards of the time because of Birmingham’s over-dependence on the automobile industry.“This city lost more jobs in less than 10 years than any other part of the UK, including the whole of Scotland and Wales combined,” says Sir Albert Bore, a leading figure on Birmingham City Council. No less than 200,000 positions disappeared and unemployment averaged 25 per cent, climbing to 50 per cent in the worst-hit areas.“We realised the government was not going to help,” he adds, recalling that the city did not have at that time a single adequate hotel or restaurant in which to house and feed the potential investors it was hoping to attract.The refusal of the British state to provide funds as a catalyst for revival forced the council to look to Brussels for help in its renaissance.“The EU made it happen because theirs was the first big investment,” Bore says. Over the following years, the city received huge amounts of funding from the EU.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

The city had boasted in the 19th century of being “the city of a thousand trades”, between them supplying the world with whatever merchandise it wanted. But many of these goods were made by a low- or semi-skilled workforce and a technology that\u0026nbspwas becoming obsolete. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFormer chair of Vote Leave refuses to apologise for breaking lawThe problems the city wrestled with in the 1980s were the same seen in other urban centres in western Europe and the US, except that in Birmingham’s case the difficulties were worse because of its vast and vulnerable vehicle-making sector. The solutions adopted resembled those elsewhere too: reviving the city centre, attracting high-skilled industries and financial services, creating a highly skilled workforce with an emphasis on expanding higher education.The 1.1 million population today is younger than any similar city in Europe, largely because there are 80,000 students from the UK and abroad studying at high-prestige institutions such as Aston University, Birmingham City University and Birmingham University, the latter alone employing 10,000 people.Financial institutions have grown here, such as\u0026nbspDeutsche Bank, which once had only a back office in the city but\u0026nbspnow has a trading floor and employs 1,500 people. New foreign-owned automotive industries like Jaguar Land Rover have moved in or been revived. Against the odds, Birmingham pressed all the right buttons to move towards a high-skilled, high-technology economy operating across the boundaries of many nation states.Over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six yearsPeople who masterminded the transition, however, now wonder if they are about to see Birmingham’s economy once again capsized, this time by the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. Among those most affected by Brexit are those enterprises and institutions which have been the wellsprings of Birmingham’s modern prosperity, uneven though the distributed of its benefits have been.Success stories that appeared assured are now in question. Will banks like Deutsche Bank and HSBC still be attracted to the same degree as before to Birmingham, or to any other city in the UK for that matter, if their ability to do business with the rest of the EU is curtailed or in doubt? Why should vehicle manufacturers, originally drawn to Britain as a platform to reach 500 million consumers in the EU, find post-Brexit Britain attractive? Will foreign staff and students at the universities be deterred by difficulties over visas, residency, qualifications and, in the case of researchers, a reduction in EU funding?Bore, credited by many with overseeing the renaissance of the city, believes that the Brexit effect will come in two stages. The short-term one will be (or already is) visible, affecting “just-in-time” deliveries of components, the financial services and all those trading with the EU. But what worries him most is the strategic long-term decisions now being taken by international companies regarding Birmingham that nobody knows about except the decision makers. He warns that “over the past year there have been investment decisions taken by a range of industries that we do not know about, but we will see their impact in five or six years”.Created with Sketch.

Eddy Moreton, a musician who owns a pub with a music venue in the town of Stourbridge west of Birmingham, says that over the past 15\u0026nbspyears he has travelled to cities and towns in Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark. He believes that leaving the EU will affect small businesses like his much more than big firms“I used to be able to get in the van and drive to Denmark, earn money, drive back – simple, but I won’t be able to do that anymore and that’s a great loss,” he says.Supporters of Remain in Birmingham are outraged by what they see as the misinformation, ignorance and xenophobia that typified the EU referendum campaign everywhere. \u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit, for many in south Wales life offers few prospectsJon Bloomfield, a historian and urban policy specialist, is the author of Our City: Migrants and the Making of Modern Birmingham, a highly informed and eloquent account of life in a modern British city during a period of globalisation, austerity and mass migration.\u0026nbspAt its core are interviews with 50 migrants, illustrating the ersity of the immigrant communities in Birmingham, but Bloomfield also paints a picture of a city that responded energetically and successfully to the multiple challenges posed by radical economic change.Bloomfield was horrified by the way the Brexit campaign legitimised xenophobia and racism. He relates how he tried and failed to get Gisela Stuart, the Leave-supporting Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, herself born and raised in Germany, to condemn Boris Johnson for demonising EU political leaders as the heirs of Hitler and Napoleon in trying to create a European superstate.I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place -\u0026nbspbut if you go to the outer city it is just not there.“My mind almost explodes with rage,” says Bore when he hears the EU being scapegoated for miseries caused by domestically generated economic policies.“People feel left behind but that’s austerity for you: it drives despair, it drives unemployment. People have to have somebody to blame and they’ve blamed Europe,” he goes on.Local government in Birmingham is hampered in doing anything to alleviate the deprivation caused by austerity because its budget has been slashed by £750m\u0026nbspsince 2010 thanks to central government cuts. \u0026nbspMisinformation and austerity explain much, but they cannot explain everything when it comes to analysing why, despite many signs of economic success, Birmingham voted in the 2016 referendum to leave the EU by the slim margin of 50.4 per cent to 49.6. In the west midlands as a whole, the Leave majority was much higher at 59.3 per cent.Remain voters were aghast and baffled by the outcome, often reacting with derisive cliches about “turkeys voting for Christmas”, given that the economic arguments for staying in the EU seemed to them so overwhelming. The simple answer to this is that the turkeys in question never felt that they had much of a Christmas to celebrate at any time and were never likely to offer endorsement at the ballot box to anybody in charge of the festivities.The beneficiaries of Birmingham’s well-advertised economic renaissance included only a proportion of its inhabitants, in sharp contrast to the impression given by its bustling multiethnic city centre. Alex Aitken, a 25-year-old care worker and a Labour councillor representing a ward in the Northfield constituency, says that the city’s reputation for ethnic and social ersity is deceptive.“I know someone who has moved into Northfield from Brixton,” he says, “and they couldn’t get over how white it was, as they had heard how Birmingham is this erse place with multiple backgrounds, but if you go to the outer city it is just not there.”Tory isions deepen over Brexit amid warnings of a ‘national crisis’Aitkin says that districts in these areas are markedly different from inner-city Birmingham and much more like the northeast of England where there are “those old-school Labour seats that voted Leave”.The ision – essentially between those who benefited from globalisation and those who did not – is the same all over England and Wales. A breakdown of the referendum vote ward by ward in Birmingham shows that three decisive factors are educational qualifications, age and ethnicity. These explain more than\u0026nbsp90 per cent of the variation in voting and were a more accurate determinant of voting choice than poverty and social class. The lower the educational level, the higher the number of people voting Leave vote and vice versa. \u0026nbspMartin Rosenbaum, in a study of the ethnic dimension of the Birmingham vote, writes that Shard End ward, which is 82 per cent white, “had the highest Leave vote, at 76 per cent, and the lowest proportion of graduates, at 9 per cent. In contrast, Moseley and King’s Heath ward had the lowest Leave share, at 23 per cent, and consists of 46 percent graduates.” Only in the five wards where migrants are the majority did the less well educated and older voters chose Remain.Leave voters told pollsters that the priority issues for them were “immigration” and “sovereignty”, in contrast to Remainers who plumped for “the economy”.In Stourbridge, a town which voted Leave by 68 per cent, Eddy Moreton says that many there are “independent-minded people who work for themselves and see the world through a conservative prism of self-reliance”. He describes the town as being a very white place with few immigrants where xenophobia is common and there is an “I’m all right Jack” attitude. \u0026nbspThe DUP has put Northern Ireland’s future in peril over BrexitHow far have isions exposed by the referendum fuelled a real rise in ethnic isions in Birmingham and elsewhere? Some 44 per cent of the city population are first- or second-generation migrants and they will soon be in the majority.One needs to downplay a tendency since the referendum to see all toxic developments as somehow caused by the result. There was a widely reported hammer attack on the windows of five mosques in Birmingham in March but police concluded that they were not carried out by far-right extremists and detained a man under the Mental Health Act who handed himself in at a police station. Recent demonstrations in March by Muslim parents over teaching about LGBT+ relationships in primary schools are best explained by the growing conservatism of Muslim communities in Britain and not as collateral damage related to Brexit.Yet the political atmosphere is definitely becoming hotter and more poisonous. Moreton, who argues for better housing and cost-effective solar energy use in Stourbridge, is worried by a growing intolerance of contrary opinions.The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greaterHe and his wife run a pub called the Katie Fitzgerald’s, named after his wife’s mother who came from Cork, though he says that it is not an Irish pub in the traditional sense. They had suspected even before the referendum that Ireland would eventually become an issue in Britain because of the border and this might make them vulnerable because of their Irish sympathies. Sure enough, during the campaign he found himself accused in public of being a supporter of the IRA. Nothing further happened, but he remains anxious because “none of us know how high the political temperature will go” and “many people blame Ireland because they think it stops them having the Brexit they want”.Above all other anxieties, there is the issue of “immigration”, which all polls and surveys say was the prime and determining issue in the referendum. Leading Brexiteers in parliament seldom speak of it, as if embarrassed by their exploitation of the issue, but it has not gone away or ceased to resonate. For decades the populist end of the mass media has drip-fed readers with stories of immigrants who are “spongers” on the welfare state, though figures show that they draw on it less than the non-immigrant population. The perception of migrants as parasites may be ebbing, but is not going to go away.Misperceptions are not all on the right. Bloomfield writes that people broadly supportive of immigration underestimate the impact of raw economic competition between different low-income communities for limited opportunities in jobs and housing. He quotes a successful entrepreneur born in China who gave an unsentimental summary of the forces shaping race relations.“It is much easier to get on if you live in wealthy St John’s Wood or Edgbaston,” he says. “When you have conflict for jobs, for survival, then it’s much harder. It depends what level you are at. If you are facing poverty, good race relations are much harder.”Overall, the big cities of Europe like Birmingham –\u0026nbspBarcelona, Munich and Milan\u0026nbsp– have done better than national governments in responding to the explosive impact of globalisation. The short-term effect of a Brexit might be less significant than people fear, but the long-term impact – political, social and economic – will most likely be much greater.Moreton, for instance, fears a slow slide from Britain as a European welfare state to something closer to the free-market American model. “But it won’t happen overnight so people will say the idea is just fearmongering,” he says.What is undeniable is that Brexit has already produced a crisis that has lasted three years and shows no sign of ending. The rebirth that Birmingham and other British cities once sought pre-Brexit may no longer be attainable in an era of instability and turmoil.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Struck by the extreme socioeconomic disparity, remnants of both the caste system and the impact of colonialism, I was fascinated by this rich, complex country.\u0026nbspIn particular, I was gripped by the plight of the Aasis, also known as “untouchables”, indigenous tribal communities which\u0026nbsplive on the outside, or on the margins, of Indian society.They have shirked India’s caste system, by opening a community where all group members are different, but equal. But in respect to the rest of the country, Aasis are exiled: separated and subordinated.\u0026nbspMoved by the Aasis’ plight, I began to direct an exciting art project that would open the Aasis’ culture and build an awareness of their ancient traditions and self-resilience. I wanted to stimulate and record Aasi art, performance and story-making. The aim was to share their narratives around the world, with audiences who did not even know they existed.\u0026nbspThis is the story of my utopian idea, and its sheer catastrophe in practice.​Gandhi’s influence in India diminishesI leave home gladly, excited to be on my intrepid voyage to the wilderness in India, my favourite country. It is snowing so hard as I make my way to the airport. England has ground to a complete standstill, while\u0026nbspeveryone complains about the weather. The roads are slushy but the taxi\u0026nbspeventually arrives. At the airport I I think, ‘Here I am –\u0026nbspat the start of my adventure!’The plane, of course, is delayed for hours\u0026nbspbut eventually makes it to\u0026nbspBombay\u0026nbspwhere I am to catch a flight the next day.\u0026nbspI step out of the terminal and into\u0026nbspthe hot wave of blurred air as smog hits me. Knocked for six, I try to breathe. I sniff. I cough, and blink. Quite a change from the bitter “Beast from the East”\u0026nbspblizzard paralysing Blighty.\u0026nbspI’m so late the driver sent by my hotel is nowhere to be seen.Can’t be that hard to find a taxi, I think.\u0026nbspI follow signs and, a disorientated while later, I find myself in a multistory car park trying to book an Uber. Eventually I find my taxi and show him the address of my hotel, which is supposed to be very near to the airport (according to TripAdvisor), and easy to find (hence my booking). The driver does not seem very confident, or much more clued in than me – though that may be because the language gap. Down the back streets of Bombay, he gets lost and can’t find the hotel. He drops me off at a hotel that isn’t the one I had booked. Unknowing, I get out, pay him, and he drives off. I go to this hotel\u0026nbspbut it isn’t mine. They direct me. Lost, unsettled, confused, eventually, I find the hotel I booked.When I arrive, the manager (who speaks Pidgin English, thank goodness) tells me that they already cancelled my booking, since I had not appeared at 12pm. I’m late. And there will be no refund. What to do.\u0026nbspI tell him that I did not cancel my booking, my flight was delayed. There was no way to inform him that I would be late, since I was on a plane. He just says I have no booking. Goodbye.What are the options… I have no idea where I am, I could go back to that other hotel, but I can’t remember how to get there. I ask the manager if I can book another room. He says I can, but for a price three times the price of the original booking I had made (which he had cancelled). Plus, the price of the previous room of\u0026nbspwhich they had cancelled the booking. SCAM! Welcome to India. I argue with him for a bit, and try to barter the price, without much success. There is very little I can do. I’m too tired. I book the room, go there and fall asleep (completely exhausted).I awake at 3.30am the following morning, after an unsettled night, and have a cold shower (no hot water), make myself a coffee with my travel kettle. Refreshed, I go downstairs. The hotel taxi costs 5 times what the Uber cost yesterday. I try to argue, but no one speaks English. It’s like arguing with a brick wall. I leave, cross, in a hurry.But I get to the airport in one piece, and in plenty of time for my flight. I try to get money out of the ATM. It does not accept my card. The second machine is broken. The third refuses to give me any money. Buzz. A text message from my bank. Apparently, a considerable amount of money has been withdrawn from my bank account. Not me! Fraud. My account is blocked.\u0026nbspI have no access to money.The bank puts me on hold (expensive minutes)\u0026nbspbut there isn’t time to wait. It is about 1am in the UK anyway. Bank closed. What to do?I need to concentrate on the next stage of my imminent adventure. Waiting for the next flight, I meet one of my collaborators, Krishna, an art therapy student, who has come from Singapore to join me on this trip. We have an Indian breakfast (a version of the Indian staple,\u0026nbspcurry), plus coffee, and board the flight to Raipur.​There we meet\u0026nbspJaya, also an art therapist. We also meet our\u0026nbsplocal guru\u0026nbspwho is to\u0026nbsptake us around the Aasi villages. Almost ready, I’ll just get my bag.\u0026nbspI realise that my baggage is lost. Oh dear! I ask my friends to talk to the Jet Airways team and raise this problem. What am I going to do without all my stuff?Onwards. Either I’ll never see any of it again, or else they might somehow find it, in which case it will have to wait here until I return to Raipur. Anyway, I have my medication, my phone, my bank card (which isn’t working). I’ll survive.We leave the airport and begin a five-hour cab journey\u0026nbspto Kondagaon, the town where we will base ourselves during our visits to five Aasi villages in this area. In Kondagaon, we stay in a hotel. I share a room with Jaya, who very kindly lends me some of her clothes. No matter that I resemble a mountain of lead beneath a corpuscular tent, these clothes are very pretty. Indian chic (if pasty, unkempt, above my white-cum-blue pallor).Practical difficulties arise: who pays the bills, when my card is blocked? What to do… I ring my bank\u0026nbspbut the problem of sourcing money persists.For dinner, us comrades go to the local restaurant (which we visit three times a day, every day, during our odyssey around Kondagaon). We always have the same thing: for dinner and lunch there is roti, or countless chapatis, with spicy sauce (how hot can you take it?) and vegetables, pulses, or meat, followed by a large dollop of rice to mop it all up. For breakfast there is dosa\u0026nbsp– the\u0026nbsplarge, thin, crispy (slightly greasy at the edges) curved pancake, dunked in a selection of spicy sauces and unknown concoctions. Some involve coconut, or chickpeas. Most are definitively hot. Curry for brekkie. Quite a wake-up call. This comes with short, very sweet, cups of coffee.I have a cold shower and potter about the area near the hotel. Lots of stray dogs and cows. Everyone stares at me. I stick out like a (sore) thumb. So white I’m china blue, remember, complete with permanent, haggard bags beneath my eyes. Namaste, I bow to every stranger.Five hours after I usually eat, I’m famished, and guzzle whatever there is. How unusual. I have a history of, to put it mildly, being fussy (or severely disordered eating). In India I eat whenever and whatever food is given. We discuss the plans for today.The guru will lead us to villages\u0026nbspwhere we will meet members of the Aasi people\u0026nbspand talk to them about the role that art and craft plays in their daily lives and traditions. We will ask if they would like to make art with us, and take part in creative workshops about storytelling, to hear and share their stories, about their lives, homes, culture and their spiritual beliefs.The first village we go to is laden with sense stimuli. I watch the ritualistic sacrifice of a cock and a boar. They squirm and twitch. Blood flows. Still, they convulse. Where is life? I think. Surely they’re dead? Why are they moving? The spirit doesn’t leave these bodies immediately. It is applauded, hallowed to the Aasis. Engrossing, revolting, captivating: a powerful ceremony.This is set within the deep, earthy chthonia (or the underworld) of the landscape around the village. A meeting is called, dominated by the men. They do all the talking. The women (who do all the work in the fields, and seem to run the economy and sub-structure of the working village) are silent. We decide that we would like to work with the women and the children, so we ask for permission to talk with them about our project. They are silent. The village meeting becomes “one for the lads”, and we make no headway with discussions or plans about the project.There is apparently a school teacher who speaks English. I long to find him, so that I can have some kind of input, or understand the conversation, so far in Hindi. My inability to follow or make any sense whatsoever of the discussion (being left outside of all discussion) continues to be a huge problem.We find the teacher. He invites us into the shady classroom – a cool, airy, open space with mud walls and a roof. Relieved, I open a spiel about the aims and intentions of the project. The teacher interrupts me:“Yes, but what’s in it for us?”“We have you westerners come here often,” he continues. “I understand why you are here. The Aasis are very interesting to the west, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need you. What have you to give us that we don’t already have or want? No one will participate in August. We’re all busy in the fields. It’s impossible, then. Other times are difficult. You haven’t made it clear exactly what benefits you’re offering us, in any case.”The\u0026nbspAasis\u0026nbspare very interesting to the West, as a self-contained, self-composed, self-reliant people. We are happy in ourselves, with ourselves. We don’t need youThis is pertinent, practical and ontological criticism. It points towards serious flaws in the project, which need addressing. Urgently. What are we offering to or for the Aasis? Why would they need this project? Or is it just about me, my ideas, my project, my hopes? Except, by now the project is far larger than my own investment in it. It’s a global collaboration.The guru says this man is a case of “intellectual arrogance”, and we must continue, despite his claims. But we need to pause and reflect. The man was saying that I am arrogant the colonial coming over to instal her views – which suit my purposes\u0026nbspbut not the Aasis’. I do nothing for the Aasis.Downcast, I leave the village in sheer dismay. It seems the “untouchables”\u0026nbsp(rightly) don’t want to be touched and we have no right to do so.Bumpy journey on the way to the second village. We have lunch. There are eight of us, including our guru’s conglomeration of friends. I’m silent, exhausted, and thoughtful. A thousand and one (hundred) rupees later, I’m running out of money fast. Very bad mood. Off to village two, and I hope it’s more successful. But, doubtful, the whole plan’s in ruins.Eight of us journey, squeezed into the car, to the second village, which is a much more positive experience. When we arrive, we meet lots of children at the school and they seem subdued, reserved, silent, restrained. We later find out that their parents dope them with the local wine (made in each village) until they’re quiet and fall asleep, so the parents aren’t bothered by them.This village is much smaller and more remote. A different culture, a different dialect. We speak with the women, the schoolteacher, the chief. By the end of our visit, the women and children are following us around and invite us to have a drink of water and a private meeting (for and with the women), while\u0026nbspthe men are doing the same thing nearby.Then we are invited for sweet tea and some weird marzipan snack thing at the chief’s big house (outside the village). I am a sheer outsider because of the language barrier. I have no idea what anyone is saying.Fast-forward:\u0026nbspthe trip is now ON. After such a positive meeting with different members of the second village, we are formally invited to stay with them for a few days in August, and to collaborate artistically with the women and children.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumptionAfter the second village we go back to Kondagaon and I have a cold shower to refresh. Exhausted, yet again, always. Shortly, myself and my two colleagues go to the one restaurant in the region we’ve been going to, three times a day, every day. At last we can debrief and discuss what we’ve seen and learned in the villages. Our conversation restores (if momentarily) my hopes in the project. I go to bed full of hot, spicy stimuli, and fall straight to sleep (gratefully).In the morning, I awake promptly. I go for another walk in the streets, to talk to the lurking cows I have by now befriended. Pensive, I consider how the project is challenging all of my resources: ethically, linguistically, financially, corporeally, emotionally. I do not know if I could afford all these differing, demanding expenses.Soon it’s time for dosa, a shot of coffee, and onwards to village number three. We arrive. There is a Gond\u0026nbspreligious festival, which involves the selection of men to embody God. In the distance, I can see a man shaking and screaming, in a trance, as the spirit ascends into his body. His visionary ecstasy is pure, so powerful. He enters a trance, apparently to relieve suffering in the village.All the men are involved in this crucial meeting at the local temple. We watch from afar, and then go back to the village to talk to the women.This village is very spread out – quite a distance between houses. All the women are busy in the fields. Lots of buildings being erected, lots of development, brand new houses with\u0026nbsptelevision aerials. Government funding is marked by logo on each home. This is pure propaganda. They take the old tradition of building houses from mud and natural materials, with natural lighting, and replace it with cheap asbestos and electricity, branded with a political logo.Meanwhile, no one has turned up for our meeting. Eventually they arrive, but they are not interested in the project.Onwards with village four, which has a population of about 1,000. I can’t follow the conversation that evolves during our meeting with these people, due to the language barrier. They understand Hindi (partially)\u0026nbspbut can’t speak it. A long way off, I gain the impression that these people already have a powerful tradition of living artistically. Their main mediums are dancing and singing. They spend most days in the forests gathering flowers for wine, and wood. They are non-committal about whether our project will be useful to them, or not. Will you teach us a craft? They ask. Sure, we reply. Can we then learn a livelihood, to earn money?This is not our intention. The Aasis have no distinction between art and life. Art is intrinsic to and part of their daily living habits, their ontology, their traditions and ancient culture. They don’t really understand the way we determine or distinguish works of art. It’s fascinating to learn about the role art plays for Aasis.It may seem weird to them that we come over and talk about inventing a project to “do” art together, when they may not “do” art as such.\u0026nbspIn any case, they surely\u0026nbspdon’t want any white westerner to come and pollute this pure, beautiful world. I feel out of place, selfish, unneeded.So where is the project? At best, severely challenged. Where am I? Exhausted. Worried.Village five. This seems a very positive space. The people are generous with their innate creativity. As soon as we arrive, one of the women (clutching her baby on one hip) marks our foreheads with red pigment, to celebrate the religious festival “Holi”. I encourage her to put a little in my book, then I spit on the powder and we both shape and seal it onto the paper. Art!We go for a long walk around the village, meeting lots of children. We are invited to return, to fulfil our project and make art with them, in August. Excellent.How a charity uses photography to give Kenyan children a chanceWhat it’s like to walk through Kenya’s Maasai Mara with lionsProtests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWhen is Holi, what is its significance and how is it celebrated?This is a very challenging trip, on many levels. It’s hard work. I love it here. But in India I feel like an outcast, never worthy of value, a sore thumb. Because of the colour of my skin. Because I can’t speak Hindi. Because I’m English. Because I haven’t trained as an art therapist (like my colleagues, who take over). Because I apparently don’t have anything to offer. Which simply isn’t true. If the Aasis are outsiders, I am outside their outside, as the white, mute, colonial invader. This is a distinctly uncomfortable, disorientating\u0026nbspscenario. I sit, like a (large, squatting) lemon, trying to follow what sounds like gibberish, with no success. I get distracted by all the wonderful animals (everywhere) and become besotted by the beautiful children. I gaze around me, taking in the earth, the jungle, the fields, the blue houses. It’s compelling. I can’t follow what’s being said, except for occasional translations so, in a selfish way, I feel left out. A waste of space.What can I offer this project? Here, I am the rich white woman who dishes out the money. I am expected to pay for everything, with no acknowledgement, just presumption. I can’t provide meaning or content (other than monetary) since I can’t speak Hindi. They waffle on and on and on and I just can’t understand a thing. An outsider. Pointless.Heated discussion in the car on the five-hour journey back to Raipur. I raise my dissatisfaction with how things are going, and tried to simplify matters: either this happens in August, when I can come (as planned), or you two take the project away and do it another time, when I cannot come. Then it’s your project and I play no part. We argue. My colleagues have very grave concerns about the direction the project is leading, which in their eyes, is unethical. It is fundamentally wrong to go in August, and impose ourselves on the Aasis at their busiest time, harvest. I say that we asked the Aasis about this, and whereas most villages said we must not come in August, two villages said that they would welcome us. The guru adds that there would always be a time available for an activity such as art-making – for example, between 5pm-9pm\u0026nbsp– even during harvest.My colleagues say that it is still intrinsically unethical to impose ourselves upon them. In addition, it’s wrong and scientifically unclinical to live with the Aasis during the project. “They eat cats!”I want to inhabit the project, and stay with the people, eat, sleep, make art, work with the people. This is crucial. Our guru concurs, you can’t do this without living with them, he says. It will only work if you stay with the Aasis.Krishna and Jaya are very unhappy with this idea, from a clinical perspective, which relies on having critical distance between oneself and one’s client.All my suggestions and all the project are unethical and complicated.F***\u0026nbspthat. It’s a simple decision: either it happens. And it happens in August, if it happens with me. Or it either doesn’t happen at all, or they take it away and do something very different.Jaya says that if there has to be a decision now, she and Krishna (with art therapy hats) will have to pull out. I retort: fine. I’ll do it with our guru. It’s on!My proposal: I will come out for two weeks in August and deliver the project, showing and sharing art with the intention of retaining social history. We want to open and share ancient cultures, storytelling, narratives, crystallised, composed, distributed, retained, made history. I will stay in the villages and our guru will collaborate and contribute as translator. Krishna and Jaya may decide to join me if they eventually deem what’s happening sufficiently “ethical”, whatever that means.In Raipur. A horrible situation last night. After a very difficult, tense journey here from Kondagaon, after the disintegration of the project, there is a heavy silence. We stop for fuel. I have to pay. My card won’t work. Blocked again. I have no idea how I’m going to pay for everything during the rest of this trip.We arrive at the hotel our guru had booked. Krishna and Jaya decide to share a room so they can discuss the project, and their reservations, without me. I have a room to myself. I get very excited because there is a kettle and a teacoffee-making facility. I accidentally turn on the kettle and it catches fire! Suddenly there is a fire in the room! F***! I hastily pick up the burning kettle, with flames everywhere, and I chuck it in the sink. Sheesh. Fire!\u0026nbspI turn on the tap and luckily it soon goes out. Smoke everywhere! Choke! Even worse than the polluted smog outside. I go downstairs and ask for another room. Drama.At 8pm two people whom I met and worked with on my last trip here, in Raigarh, turn up. These are genuine and committed political activists, well known for their dedicated work on human rights and the Aasi people. They showed me round villages during my previous visit to Korba, when I made a documentary film. I remember going to a Neo-Marxist (Naxalite) meeting with them. Though I had no idea what was being said, I sensed the fervour and passion, always uprising in their voices, in their lives, in their need. Something must be done! This had been one reason why I’d returned to India, to make art with the Aasis. But this time I’m in a different area, with different tribes, who have different problems. No mines here.The couple made a five-hour train journey to see me in Raipur. Wow! How nice, I think to myself. We can have dinner and chat. But they don’t speak English and expect me to put them up for the night here at this hotel. The white colonialist should pay for everything. They also think I have a serious political proposition and want to collaborate with their staunchly activist agenda.\u0026nbspInnocent, rather confused, I did not realise they were coming at all, let alone under these conditions.We go out for dinner to clear the air. More roti at a nearby restaurant. The couple ask pertinent questions for the project as a whole. They are coming from the perspective of the Aasis’ around Raigarh, who face the annihilation of their landscape, homes and livelihoods by mining. They say to us: we need political solutions, we need our homeland restored, we need jobs not art! What can art actually do\u0026nbspin times of severe turmoil and trouble? In practical terms, an artwork won’t save someone’s life, it won’t bring social, political or economic solutions.By now my project is in tatters. I can’t begin to retaliate to these crucial challenges. The couple say that my project, or any project with art, or art per se, cannot help the Aasi population anywhere in India. There are other, pressing, urgent demands that should take precedence over anything that wants to engage with art, craft, culture or cultural heritage. Art is a luxury, not a basic need.These ideas and criticisms are essential to face and focus on. I retreat and rethink everything. The couple return to Raigarh and I spend one last night in Raipur. In the morning, I go to the airport and they have found my luggage! It went from Bombay to Delhi back to Bombay, then to Raipur. Anyway, I have it now. Jam-packed full of creased clothes and melted cheese (my present for the Aasis, now a pile of smudged fat and grease, leaking through the molten rubber casing). The situation between us three “collaborators”\u0026nbspis very difficult. I’m the Rich Old Stupid Mute(d) Colonial Imposter. Good enough to pay. Nothing else. Silence. Then, at the airport, we separate (even on the same flight).The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumbNow on my own, I have time to reflect. This trip went from awful – luggage lost, fraud, card blocked – to worse than extreme,\u0026nbspbecoming the Outsider, a crisis of identity.Back in Bombay, I go for a frank meeting with the people who had offered to fund the whole project (that is, invest and pay for the major undertaking proposed in August, and also for the global travelling exhibition, book, and other intended happenings). As a result of this meeting, the project is officially OFF. For a practical reason, the funders said it would be madness to try and do it during the monsoon season, and simply would not be possible.Off for another reason: there are already numerous NGOs that work with the Aasis and their art. The funders suggest that if I still want to do this project, I must collaborate and work under one of them. There’s apparently an awful lot of AasiGond art out at the moment, so nothing new or valuable about my proposition. It already exists. It’s very popular. This points to yet another flaw:\u0026nbspinadequate research. It seems that there is no need for my project, and it must not happen at the only time I can do it. Shall I wait, rethink, gain new collaborators, work under another organisation (not from my own ideas), and then in two years’ time, after I’ve qualified as an art therapist, try again? But I’ll have a career – I hope – by then? The passion will have withered. It’s inconceivable. So it’s off. Officially.I’m distraught. I have spent the past four years organising this project. And now, it’s been a waste of time, energy, money. So much money.I leave the meeting with the funders with a premise from contemporary Indian neurology. A neuroscientist friend of the couple is at the meeting. We talk for a while, and I tell her about the damage to my left temporal lobe, which still affects me. Do you have any ideas for how to retain memory? I ask her. Yes, she says. In my research, I have found a solution to brain damage: to regenerate brain cell growth you must starve yourself, and take up running. I suggest you eat a low-calorie diet and go for a run at least twice daily. That should restore your memory and make your brain work better. Touché. I do not tell her that my previous experience of extreme starvation had been almost deadly. Is this advice what I should take from my time in India?By now, I’m in my hotel room in Bombay. Last night I slept well, because of my medication. I awoke at around 4:45am\u0026nbspand had a coffee. I will have something to eat at 7.30am – free breakfast, included in the expensive package of staying here. I was very upset yesterday. I’m still upset now, due to the collapse of the project. I don’t feel very well, mentally or physically. I’m exhausted, distraught, I feel dizzy, my head aches, I’m so disappointed.I mean, nothing’s wrong: by now I have my luggage, I’m in a room at a hotel. There’s hot water, wifi and a kettle. My bank card is now working, and I have enough cash left to get me to the airport. But I am defeated. My spirit, my passion for this project, for the Aasis, has died. How pathetic. A waste. Hopeless. Now. In fact.Created with Sketch.The blind elephants of India\u0027s popular Amber Fort tourist attraction Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amber Fort is one of India’s biggest tourist attractions, where elephants, many of whom are blind and lame, are forced to haul tourists up and down the steep fortMore than 100 elephants are kept at Amber FortOf the 103 elephants, 10 had tuberculosis, 19 were blind in one eye or both, and all suffered foot problems, according to a 2018 health report by the Animal Welfare Board of India When the animals are not forced to give rides to tourists they are often kept alone at night, heavily chained in “concrete boxes”.

Many visitors do not realise the animals are blind or lame.Tourist elephant rides are a steady business at Amber FortWhen I came to India, I was relieved and thrilled to be going to a warmer climate, to be releasing my darling project, to be collaborating with friends and useful people, to be fulfilling hopes and dreams. I was seriously considering emigrating to live in India. I changed my mind, when so disheartened – completely losing heart – by reactions and assumptions to me as a person and my project. For the Aasis, the guru, his friends, my collaborators, everyone I encountered in India, I am – and can only be – the colonial invader. I hold history on my back. It cripples me.The situation I encountered then seemed to confirm the aftermath of western colonialism. This was evident in the person I came to represent, as the white person who paid for everything and stuck out like a sore thumb. This happened because I can’t speak either Hindi or any of the Aasi dialects, I had to rely on my colleagues’ translation, I was separated and removed from proceedings and decisions. I felt separated and judged as the only white person.Crushed, I felt an outcast. This was very interesting, since perhaps I could then empathise with the Aasis’ situation on the margins of Indian society, and the caste system. I was an outsider, the Aasis are outsiders, but I was unable to connect with them. I felt cast out of their being cast out.The Aasis are not interested in my art project. They say they are happy, self-contained, self-sufficient people, they don’t need a western intervention from a white person.Protests erupt in India after videos of sexual assaults go viralWorld only thinks of Kashmir when it’s close to war, say politiciansThe girls hoping to fire India to Street Child Cricket World Cup gloryIndia bans imports of waste plastic to tackle environmental crisisIndia close to creating ‘green fireworks’ in effort to curb pollutionHaving been planning this project for over four years now, this is extremely disappointing. What can I learn from it? Perhaps the idea that there is never such a thing as “post”-colonial is an important observation to take from this episode. On the one hand, my proposed intervention seemed to rely on dominance and hierarchy (despite my best intentions). I approached the Aasi people with ideas and propositions about engaging with art as a form of sense-making. Some of these ideas were based around a form of art psychotherapy (with my colleagues, who were trained, and arguably blinkered around this field).Maybe this seemed an imposition of unwanted material. Who says the Aasis want or need art therapy? In the area we visited, there seemed little social unrest or disturbance. Any intervention from a westerner seemed unnecessary, unwanted. That is not to say the Aasis did not welcome usme. They listened, and two villages invited us to come into their community and make art with them, to do our project. But it is important to learn that the project being offered to the Aasis seemed to reconfirm a colonial dynamic. The contrary was my intention.I am left wondering if or how it is ever possible to be truly “post”-colonial. Are the remnants of history, the battle scars of the British Empire, impossible to eradicate or move on from? Now, I must consider how to facilitate a project which has a more elastic, symbiotic rapport with people on the margins, without reconfirming the barrier between the inside and outside of those margins.I had hoped my project would engage the Aasis’ ancient heritage and culture, to celebrate their innate capacity to regenerate. I began as the utopian wishing to destroy the empirical patriarchy I emerge feeling ever restrained, and crushed, by that very history and identity I’d wanted to challenge and disrupt.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But debate has raged about whether the detection was legitimate, as well as about where it could have come from if it is.Now it has been independently confirmed for the first time, marking a major step forward in the hunt for the mysterious source of the gas.On Earth, methane is a key sign of life, and is emitted from biological organisms. Even if the Martian gas is coming from another process, it is still likely to be an indication that the red planet\u0027s surface is far more active than previously thought.In June 2013, the Curiosity rover spotted methane on the Martian surface, near the Gale Crater.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nasa celebrated Black Friday by looking into space instead — sharing pictures of black holes230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

That should prove useful to scientists looking to investigate further where the methane could be coming from.Ever since methane was first detected, more than 10 years ago, debate has raged about whether it is coming from microorganisms or from geochemical reactions underground.If it is coming from microorganisms then scientists could be able to follow the trace of gas in an attempt to discover whatever life could be hiding beneath the Martian surface. But the researchers in the new paper, titled \u0027Independent confirmation of a methane spike on Mars and a source region east of Gale Crater\u0027 and published in Nature Geoscience, note that will not be possible until its source can be found.Scientists sent the ExoMars orbiter to the planet in 2016, in the hope that it can better understand the operation of methane on its surface and possible understand better where it is emerging from.As well as confirming the previous detection, and helping locate a possible location to search for further emissions, the new paper suggests that the methane on Mars might not be emerging in the way some expect. Rather than coming from large emissions and being present around the whole of Mars, it might instead come out in small, short emissions from whatever process is producing it, the researchers write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, right now, nothing has been agreed.”And Mr Letwin said: “This is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no deal exit. We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying.”\u0026nbspThe plan is to commandeer the Commons for the rest of the week, with MPs passing a motion on Wednesday to grab the agenda the following day, in order to pass the legislation.It would then move onto the House of Lords next week, when the UK will be just days from leaving the EU with no agreement on Friday next week.The two MPs say they are not trying to stamp on further attempts for the Commons to agree an alternative Brexit plan – but argue vetoing a no-deal must take priority.EU offers Brexit delay if general election or second referendum- liveIsis bride Shamima Begum says she is \u0027bored\u0027 of BrexitNick Boles quit the Tories over Brexit. Let the civil war beginWhat happens now after MPs rejected alternatives to May\u0027s Brexit deal?Brexit can be delayed if UK calls referendum or general electionThat would have “catastrophic consequences for manufacturing industry, food prices, medicine supplies, policing and national security”, a view apparently confirmed by Britain’s top civil servant.As last time, when the prime minister secured a delay beyond the original Brexit day of 29 March, the government would propose the length of the extension being sought. MPs would debate and vote on it.Ms Cooper added: “She needs to put forward a proposal, including saying how long an extension she thinks we need to sort things out.“If the government won’t act urgently, then parliament has a responsibility to try to ensure that happens, even though we are right up against the deadline.”The move risks cutting the chances of the EU granting an extension – because it delays the next chance for MPs to coalesce around a rival Brexit plan to justify it.Anna Soubry, The Independent Group MP, had revealed plans for a ‘composite motion’, combining a softer Brexit with a Final Say referendum, to break the deadlock.We’ll tell you what’s true.

No question.”On Monday, MPs will hold\u0026nbspa second series of indicative\u0026nbspvotes on different Brexit options after none of the eight options considered – including a customs union with the EU and a “confirmatory second” referendum – was able to command a majority in the first round.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It is unconstitutional. It is inconceivable that we should be presented with a bill which could be rammed through in one day.John Bercow, the\u0026nbspHouse of Commons speaker, has confirmed that he would allow Yvette Cooper\u0027s bill ruling out a no-deal Brexit to be debated and passed in one day.\u0026nbspMr Bercow said it was not disorderly for all of the stages of the bill - which would normally be spread out over several months -\u0026nbspto be held on Thursday, as per Ms Cooper\u0027s plan. Britain is currently on course to leave the EU without a deal next Friday.\u0026nbspOne consequence of the backbenchers\u0027 plan to introduce the bill this week is that\u0026nbspthere may not be time for Theresa May to try to hold a fourth vote on her Brexit deal. It was thought that such a vote could take place on Wednesday or Thursday, but that would be difficult if backbenchers succeed in seizing the Commons agenda to\u0026nbsppass the Cooper bill.MPs will make a fresh attempt to compel Theresa May to delay Brexit further by passing legislation on Thursday, a cross-party alliance has announced.A bill – designed to clear the Commons in a single day – would prevent a “drift into no-deal by accident in just 10 days’ time”, its supporters say.The move will delay a further round of “indicative votes”, following the failure to reach a consensus on Monday night, raising the threat of a crash-out Brexit.Read our piece here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsphttps:www.newsukpoliticsbrexit-latest-no-deal-mp-stop-april-12-article-50-extension-yvette-cooper-a8850771.htmlNEW: A cross-party move to rule out a no-deal Brexit has been table by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory grandee Oliver Letwin. It\u0027s pretty techy, but the crux is this is an attempt to stop the UK crashing out of the EU on 12 April.Letwin won the chance to control the parliamentary agenda on several days\u0026nbsp- which he used to call indicative votes. But as MPs couldn\u0027t agree, he is now focusing instead on bringing forward this bill.If the PM\u0026nbsprefuses to seek an extension of Article 50, this bill would require her to do so.Ms Cooper said:\u0026nbsp“We are now in a really dangerous situation with a serious and growing risk of No Deal in 10 days’ time.“The Prime Minister has a responsibility to prevent that happening. She needs to put forward a proposal, including saying how long an extension she thinks we need to sort things out.“If the Government won’t act urgently, then Parliament has a responsibility to try to ensure that happens even though we are right up against the deadline.Letwin said:\u0026nbspThis is a last-ditch attempt to prevent our country being exposed to the risks inherent in a no deal exit. We realise this is difficult. But it is definitely worth trying.”\u0026nbspNick Boles quit the Tories over Brexit – and now the party is in open civil war, writes Independent commentator John Rentoul.\u0026nbspRead his column here:\u0026nbsphttps:www.voicesnick-boles-resigns-brexit-conservatives-vote-customs-union-a8850086.htmlMPs have launched a new committee to probe the threats caused by disinformation to democracy. Tory MP Damian Collins will chair it - continuing his work as chair of the DCMS committee, and thorn in the side of tech giants.He said: “Since beginning our investigations, tech companies have only shifted superficially in their approach to privacy, and only for the benefit of their own PR.It’s unacceptable and we must keep up the pressure for them to shift their approach to ensure people and their rights are protected.First on the agenda will be the government\u0027s white paper on online harms, which was due to be published by the end of March.Brexit committee chairman Hilary Benn said that if the PM did not announce she was seeking an Article 50 extension, MPs could try to force her to on Wednesday.Referring to an extension request, he told the Today programme: If she does not do so then there is an option available to the House of Commons to seek to legislate to require the Prime Minister to do that.Britain\u0027s most senior civil servant has privately warned cabinet ministers of the dire consequences of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, told ministers that leaving the EU without an agreement will result in food prices rising by ten per cent, the police being unable to protect people and the economy suffering the worst recession in a decade.Direct rule would have to be restored in Northern Ireland for the first time since 2007 and the government would come under pressure to bail out companies that had gone bust, he warned.\u0026nbspRead our piece here.Despite Ms May’s departure plan having been rejected by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspthree times in the House of Commons, it is believed she may try to put it to the house for a fourth time.The meetings come amid growing speculation the prime minister could call a snap general election if a fourth attempt to pass her deal fails.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That’s what we’ll be working on this morning,” she said.Ms Soubry pointed out that the number of Tories backing a referendum was rising – from 7 to 15 on Monday night – and that, with 280 votes, a confirmatory ballot was the most popular option.“We made more progress in a days’ worth of debate than in two years of this government,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And she urged Theresa May to take the escape route from the Brexit crisis being offered, even by putting her own much-defeated deal back to the public.“If she wanted to, she could bring it back with a confirmatory vote. She would win a majority and this entire Brexit nightmare would be over by the autumn,” Ms Soubry added.On Monday night, MPs rejected all four possible Brexit alternatives, which were:* A “permanent and comprehensive” customs union – defeated by 276-273 votes* “Common market 2.0”, to keep the UK in the single market and a “customs arrangement – defeated by 282-261.* A confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal – defeated by 292-280.* Revoking of Article 50 if a crash-out Brexit looms and a no-deal has been rejected – defeated by 292-191.But Ms Soubry said the first two options failed only because their supporters would not agree to them being put to a public vote, which was the obvious area for a successful compromise.Brexit can be delayed if UK calls referendum or general electionEU negotiator warns no-deal \u0027getting more likely by day\u0027I’m a student who campaigned for Brexit – this is why I got it wrongPoliticians are obsessing over Brexit while our planet burnsPerhaps crucially, Nick Boles, the instigator of “Common market 2.0”, dramatically quit the Tory whip moments after its defeat, with a furious blast at his party’s refusal to compromise.Mr Boles also voted for the referendum option, along with one minister – Margot James – and three other former ministers, Steve Brine, Mark Garnier and Ed Vaizey.MPs will take control of the Commons agenda again on Wednesday, perhaps to pass the compromise motion, or even to try to force the prime minister to seek a long Article 50 extension.Ms May is holding a marathon Cabinet session to try and break the Brexit deadlock, as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said a no-deal withdrawal was becoming more likely by the day.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Tom Watson, the deputy leader, agreeing\u0026nbsp“if needs must, we have to then do what’s right”, when asked at the weekend about the warring parties agreeing a truce.So, what is the history of governments of national unity in this country and is the Brexit fiasco driving us towards another one?Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe key point is that they are rare, because – as you may have noticed since the Leave vote – the parties prefer shouting across the Commons\u0026nbspto cooperating across it.The last national government was led by Winston Churchill during the Second World War, following similar coalitions during the First World War and during the Great Depression of the 1930s.The obvious similarity is that all were times of huge crisis – but, just as significantly, there was an acceptance in all the parties that only cross-party working could provide a solution. Fast-forward to 2019 and there is no such recognition.We’re heading for a long Brexit delay – even the ERG is resigned to itBrexit causes record rise in stockpiling as businesses prepare for worMPs to debate revoking Article 50 before critical Commons Brexit votesBrexit batters businesses and the economy as cliff edge looms The prime minister would rather chew off her own arm than take up solutions from Labour or other parties, despite seeing her deal repeatedly rejected by huge numbers.Similarly, Jeremy Corbyn wants to use the crisis to trigger a general election that would put him in No 10 on a mission to end austerity, showing by and large a remarkable lack of interest in the details of Brexit.Meanwhile, the Commons is holding “indicative votes“\u0026nbspto try to find a common purpose, but has been unable to narrow down the options because MPs cannot agree on how to combine their favoured ones.The lesson is that it requires a consensus to form a government of national unity – and in the absence of such\u0026nbspa consensus, the idea is a non-starter.Which is why there will be not be one to solve Brexit.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

in both the single market and a customs arrangement.The Commons also turned down putting any agreed deal to a Final Say referendum – and rejected revoking Article 50 if the UK is close to the no-deal Brexit cliff-edge.The results were followed by Nick Boles, the Conservative MP behind the “Common market 2.0” plan for the single market and customs arrangement, dramatically quitting the Tory whip on the Commons floor.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, said the cabinet would discuss the impasse tomorrow – but pointed out the UK was due to leave the EU in just 11 days’ time, with no deal in

because my party refuses to compromise.

According to @AOC, they can run for President, too,” Ms Cheney tweeted in reference to a conspiracy theory espoused by Donald Trump.“I see from your dead people comment that you get your news from Facebook memes,” responded Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who linked to a Newsweek article she said would “clarify your misunderstanding” of the 22nd Amendment.Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - the Democratic congresswoman in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greets fellow lawmakers ahead of the State of the Union addressAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez participates in an event with Democratic members of CongressThe Democrat senator speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol January 30, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and fellow Democrat Rashida TlaibAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Senate chamber to watch two votes on January 24, 2019Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arrives with Chellie Pingree at a House Democratic Caucus meetingOcasio-Cortez during Donald Trump\u0027s State of the Union addressNew York State Assembly member Catalina Cruz with Ocasio-CortezNydia Velazquez talks with Alexandria Ocasio-CortezOcasio-Cortez casts her vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the HouseAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez poses with a campaign worker during a whistle stop in the Queens borough of New YorkOcasio-Cortez outside the US CapitolOcasio-Cortez after casting her ballot in the 2018 midterm general election at a polling site in New YorkAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez looks on during a march organised by the Women\u0027s March Alliance in ManhattanOcasio Cortez looks on at the Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 16, 2019Despite the crticism, Ms Ocasio-Cortez was at least partially justified in her claim Roosevelt\u0027s popularity forced a constitutional change.Lawmakers were already pushing for the 22nd\u0026nbspAmendment when Roosevelt won an unprecedented fourth term in 1944.\u0026nbspHe died less than three months after his inauguration the following year, before a Republican-controlled Congress ratified the amendment in 1947.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Government took a conscious decision and the Chancellor was very explicit that he was not prepared to spend money in making those preparations.That was a disastrous decision. I think,we had done that, then the position today would look very dferent.My preference would be to go back to Europe and say we have a clear strategy — to leave without a deal but to take six months or so to complete the preparations.Then we would be in a much stronger position.If we were to leave without making adequate preparations there would be some short-run dislocation cost. It is hard to know how serious that would be but I think the view that somehow we will have queues of lorries on the M for five years or more is absurd.The important thing is, that, with adequate preparations, I do not believe the long-term economic costs of leaving would be very dferent from staying in the European Union.But the issue should not be just about economics.One of the sad things about this whole debate is that the country has become deeply ided.People on both sides are passionate about it but they are not passionate because they have views about the economic effects.I have not met anyone who said, “I’d be in favour of BrexitI thought the impact on GDP will be less than two per cent but I’ll be in favour of RemainI thought it would be more than five per cent”.It is the issues of identity and culture and politics that are motivating people, which is why I think MPs have somehow lost the plot.When people say the consequence of leaving without a deal is national suicide, I despair.

It’s a reasonable point of view, though not one I subscribe to.But that is what we should be debating not exaggerating the economic consequences of the alternatives.I do not think it is obvious that jobs in Britain would be lostwe left the EU.Look at what has happened since the vote to leave when we were told there would be a recession.Since mid- our economy has grown by slightly more than Germany’s.The idea that voting for leave has been an economic disaster does not match facts.One of the things that many people find surprising is that the average value of sterling against other currencies is exactly the same this week as it was the day I left the Bank of England nearly six years ago. Financial markets have not panicked and businesses have carried on.We should all be more confident in our country and our future prosperity.Forget the scare stories and focus on the question: Do you, or do you not, want to be in the political club that is the European Union Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is that really less damaging than a clean break, as we’re so often told Inside the single market, our laws stay under European Court of Justice jurisdiction.We still make big annual payments to Brussels and retain “freedom of movement rules. Calling that “Brexit” makes a mockery of the  referendum result.The economic benefits of the single market are, anyway, wildly overstated. All UK firms, including the  per cent that don’t export to the EU, must comply with the expensive EU rules.The single market in services barely exists — severely penalizing the UK, the world’s second-largest services exporter.We don’t need to be in the single market to trade with Europe. The US conducts hundreds of billions of dollars of EU trade every year. We can do the same.If the single market is so great, why is the UK’s trade with the EU shrinking and our non-EU trade expanding  Why do we trade more with the rest of the world The EU’s customs union is also wrongly presented as economic heaven. But it means the UK charges tarfs on imports from outside the EU. So British shoppers pay more for a range of imports, including food and clothing, to shield uncompetitive producers in other EU states.Some  per cent of these tarfs are then sent to Brussels — billions of pounds each year.The customs union also stops Britain striking trade deals with nations outside the EU — four-fths of the global economy.As the centre of economy gravity shts decisively east, it is vital that Britain engages more with the world’s fastest-growing and most populous markets.Nations acting alone have secured far more important trade deals, covering a much bigger share of the global economy. In , Switzerland struck a trade deal with China — so can we.The narrative that Soft Brexit — or no Brexit at all — makes economic sense has been shaped by the same establishment voices who told us, back in , that simply voting to leave the EU would spark “an immediate and profound economic shock”. They were wrong then and wrong now.A Clean Brexit, in contrast, outside the EU’s main legal constructs means Britain would thrive — precisely why Brussels doesn’t want it to happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There are currently almost , empty nurse jobs in England.And a new report by think tanks the Nuffield Trust, the Health Foundation and The King’s Fund predicts this could rise to , within five years.In the meantime, it is unsurprising to hear that nine out of ten NHS nurses say staff shortages are affecting the quality of care they can give their patients.One major problem is that we take our nurses for granted. Many AE nurses in particular are subject to unacceptable levels of rudeness, abuse and even violence.Hospitals are increasingly being run by non-medical staff who are mostly driven by targets and not quality of care. And more nurses are having to sit filling out paperwork rather than actually nursing.We also don’t pay nurses enough. You can probably work in Tesco stacking shelves for the same money as some nurses are paid — and live a much less stressful le.All too often, it’s not until we find ourselves dependent on nurses doing a good job that we truly appreciate them and what they do for us.When my grandmother was very ill in hospital, pretty much the only good thing about her hospital experience was the nurses.They were kind, chatty, cared for her, spoke to her and treated her with dignity in a very grim situation.We need to start appreciating nurses before it’s too late. Then we need to put our money where our mouths are.Sure, nursing is a vocational job. But money still matters, especiallyyou are living in a big city.It costs £, a year to train as a nurse. Nurses who have served ten years with the NHS should be given that money back in what I would call a “legacy payment”.If that payment is given in their pension, it would cost the Government very little, but I am sure nurses would love it.Since , the Government has axed the bursaries for people who are studying nursing or midwery at university.The budget for helping staff to develop their skills in the workplace has also been cut to a third of its value of five years ago.We need to give more support to people who want to train and bring back the bursaries.The current pay structure means that some fantastic nurses are underpaid — and that some terrible nurses are overpaid.We need to smash the pay structure and let hospitals pay what they want to their nurses and not be confined by pay brackets, so that really good nurses are rewarded and bad nurses are not.That would make a big dference, because we all know how demoralising it is to work really hard and yet be paid the same as someone who doesn’t.Nursing involves long and unsociable hours. All too often it involves having dinner at breakfast time. Nurses need to be offered more financial reward for working night shts.How will this money be raised  For a start, the NHS needs to make efficiencies, such as central buying and not give out vanity boob jobs and other medically unnecessary procedures.It needs to start charging peoplethey miss a GP appointment without good cause, and there should be means testing for patients over the age of  before they get free prescriptions.The country is run by unsung heroes — police, doctors, teachers and nurses. They are the foundation of this country and we can’t live without them.The repercussions of continuing to treat nurses with the lack of respect that we currently show them will be many, ied and severe.Let’s not find that out the hard way.RESEARCH showing that attractive women bosses are considered less truthful and trustworthy by both sexes is so depressing.As well as thinking that a pretty female boss is less likely to be honest, apparently both men and women also think they are more deserving of being fired than a less attractive counterpart.The implication is that any woman who shatters the glass ceiling is perceived to have used underhand methods to get there.How sad.And how far away from all of our hope that we are judged on our work, not our looks.I’M a big believer that it’s not what happens to you in le that matters so much as how you respond to it.But sometimes things happen that would make most of us want to crawl into a hole and hide.I have maximum respect for Londoner Zoe Parsons, , who has managed to turn her experience of domestic violence into something truly positive.When she told her husband, Edson Peart, that she didn’t want to have sex with him, his response was to rape her violently on a regular basis.He told her: “I own you.”After she plucked up the courage to leave him – a hugely brave act in itself – Peart broke into her house and attacked her, leaving Zoe needing stitches.Justice has now been served and Peart has been sentenced to eight and a half years in prison.Zoe has trained as a le coach, helping other survivors of domestic violence – which affects one in four women and leads to two women being killed each week.Astonishingly, marital rape was only recognised as a criminal offence in .This story is a necessary reminder that some men still misguidedly think they “own” women – and that marriage makes a woman their own personal property.For a start, private companies can pay their bosses whatever they like, as the pay comes out of the shareholders’ profits.And what MPs fail to realise is that these bosses give  per cent of whatever they earn back to the country in tax.So actually we should all be thanking God for them and the contribution they make to society, rather than making them feel bad about the money they take home.MPs might not like it but, frankly, as they seem incapable of doing their jobs at the moment, they are in no position to moan about people who get paid a large salary for doing a job well.What happened to the aspiration in this country MOSES ETTIENNE was jailed this week for claiming nearly £, from the taxpayer , in accommodation and living expenses, after saying he was living in Grenfell Tower when the fire broke out, despite giving the authorities who approved his payout a non-existent flat address.How on earth is this possible, surely an address is something simple to check Quite rightly he was jailed for five years after taking money that was set aside to help those who really needed it. Scum of the earth.But spare a thought for those for whom it’s not.I’ll be spending a quiet day with my kids and my mum.I don’t want any fancy chocolates, gts, cards or presents.Just a cup of tea in bed and a cuddle from my two kids... who can’t get their heads around the fact I have a mummy as well.VERY pleased to see that trend predictor Marian Salzman, , says the “age proud” movement is on the rise in .“Gone are the days when women lied about these things,” she says. “If you don’t say your age you look dated.”I couldn’t agree more. In fact, I make a point of never lying about my age. I am  next month – and proud.Andpeople ever say that I don’t look my age, I say: “But this is what  looks like!”WHY, when anything good happens in this country, do some people just want to whine Yet critics carp that it should be eligible only for Best International Programme, as the series first aired in the US.Shut up!It’s a British production and well worth celebrating.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Across the country, those who voted Leave in  are taking note and,betrayed, will seek revenge.The Black Spot planted on Tory plotter Dominic Grieve by his constituents last week is just for starters.The real blowback will come at the next election whenever it takes place — unless Britain is no longer a member of the EU.Polls yesterday suggested Labour is five points ahead of the Tories and poised to form a minority Government.These figures are meaningless. The next election will be decided not by votes for or against the major parties, but on the candidates’ support for the referendum result.There are .million votes up for grabs. They will either support pro-Brexit candidates or stay home and sit on their hands. Either way, it will transform the poll.Labour votes will be mopped up in Leave seats by Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, what’s left of Ukip, or, in Remain seats, by Labour deserters now known as Change UK.The picture is dferent for the Tories, depending upon when any poll is held and what happens in the next few weeks.A snap election, apparently to be announced on Wednesday, would be suicidal. Anything led by Theresa May would be a bloodbath.Under a new pro-Brexit leader, with breathing space to regroup, it could be an opportunity to clear the air once and for all. Meanwhile, we face further Commons chaos, showdowns with Brussels, the possibility of fighting European elections in May — and the outside chance of “crashing out”.No Deal is no big deal, as ex-Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told The Sun last week — at least for Britain. We would swtly overcome a short, bumpy ride.Not so for Europe — and for all their bluster, EU states are beginning to fear it happening by accident.Germany is grimly aware it is about to lose the UK as a long-standing ally in the balance of European power with France and the EU’s hard-up southern states.Without our £billion-a-year contribution — one of the biggest by EU states — Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece will be queuing in Berlin for German cash.Unless a deal on frictionless trade is reached, German exporters will be hammered and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost in their manufacturing industry.Support for “populist” parties — including in Germany — has mushroomed since the UK voted Leave.Which explains this week’s dash to Dublin by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She wants preening Irish PM Leo Varadkar to stop playing games and solve the Irish backstop question.Either he bows to technological solutions to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland or there will be a hard border at Calais with Ireland on the wrong side.Merkel knows a solution to the backstop problem would persuade the DUP to support Mrs May’s Withdrawal Bill, and even push it over the line at the fourth time of asking.That, in turn, would be enough to persuade all but the most stubborn Tories to sign up and, along with a few extra Labour votes, bring this edition of the long-running Brexit soap to a close.As always with these negotiations, nothing is settled until everything is settled, always at the th hour. It is now .pm and ticking.Let’s hope the Irish Taioseach put his clocks forward yesterday.He needs results fast. In yet another bloody incident, four innocent civilians were kned at random in North London, apparently by the same man.

And yet in their droves they voted it down on Friday, regardless of the .million votes cast nearly three years ago to leave the EU.It’s all very well for the Tories to simply assume that Jeremy Corbyn et al will never get near Downing Street – but it would be criminally complacent.We’ve more or less given up on the Brexiteers who refuse to vote for the PM’s deal, even though their preferred “no deal” is essentially impossible.But those who are tempted to plump for a permanent customs union in today’s ridiculous indicative vote process must also realise that they could very well trigger an election, with unknowable consequences.We are at a crucial moment in our history, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.WHEN the Tory leadership contest begins, it is an opportunity for the party to remind the country what it stands for.You can forgive the public for forgetting.

Bodyguard came from the off-cuts of Line Of Duty and it should be eternally grateful for the association.Line Of Duty is a television masterpiece and the opening episode of the fth series was a genuine TV event that, despite a whf of plot familiarity, had me reeled in before the end of the opening credits.That was as long as it took the show to introduce Stephen Graham, who’s giving a mesmerising performance as Detective Sergeant John Corbett, the UCOwho appears to have gone rogue with an OCG .There are lots of other new faces as well, including: A gang of bikers, with no bikes, who appear to have been styled by Vyvyan from The Young Ones.Slippery police spokesman Sindwhani, played by Ace Bhatti. PC Jane Cafferty, whose le was spared in the opening hijack scene by “gangster” Lisa McQueen.And the slightly robotic Detective Superintendent Alison Powell, who’s in charge of Corbett’s “Operation Peartree” and is yet another of those department chiefs who seems strangely drawn to “Ted” .A hell of a trick for a TV show to pull off, introducing them all while still tying up the loose ends of series four and leaving viewers to guess which painkillers managed to get DS Arnott out of that wheelchair and whether Hastings’ faulty hotel toilet cistern is critical to the new plot. Or just a faulty hotel toilet cistern.The fact Line Of Duty did it, however, is entirely down to the constants that have driven this show ever since its first series.It starts, obviously, with a thrilling and complex script from Jed Mercurio, who clearly gives not a stuff for any of the lazy, modern, right-on conventions of TV writing.It’s all about the story that demands the total attention of the viewers and gets the performance of their lives from the actors.Not just the newcomers, like Stephen Graham, but regulars Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, as Arnott and Fleming, who have the hardest job in drama, unravelling the plot for the audience.Without them there would be no room for the show’s crowning glory, Super-intendent Ted Hastings, who is that rarest thing in contemporary TV drama, a strong male lead.There used to be lots of them, obviously. Now we’re generally reduced to murderers, rapists or, at best, jaw-flexing “Yes, ma’am” dogsbodies, like in Bodyguard.The joy of Hastings is that the part gets the performance it deserves from Adrian Dunbar, who’s from Northern Ireland, so he was born sardonic and can give a whole new edge to lines like: “Listen Alison. I didn’t float up the Lagan on a bubble.”Together, show and actor are a dream to watch and should be the agenda-free blueprint every new drama aims to emulate.So enjoy Hastings and Line Of Duty while you can.

She also competed for a Spilsby club.Lisa Hardy, prosecuting, told Lincoln crown court “She claimed disability living allowance and subsequently PIPs over a three year period.“She said she had serious and chronic conditions. She said she was limited to walking with crutches or using a wheelchair and that she was on morphine to control the pain.”Miss Hardy said that back in October  the DWP received a complaint that Horton’s benefit claim was fictitious but at the time she told investigators that the complaint was malicious.She said: “In February  she made a complaint for PIP. A health assessor came out to see her and she confirmed the extent of her illness.“She completed a y application process and in interview she had such severe pelvic inflammatory disease that it affected her mobility.“She said she was in constant pain every day. She said she did her food shopping online or sometimes would do click and collect. She said her husband would collect her prescription.“She told how she would live in her pyjamas for the majority of the day because it was too painful to get dressed, Lincoln crown court heard.“She said she didn’t like going out because she was too anxious. She said she would struggle to walk more than  metres.“She was asked to perform a number of physical tasks which she said she could not complete. As a result she was awarded PIP.“An investigation subsequently showed that Miss Horton as far back as January  had in fact joined a kickboxing club and was a regular member.“She received grading certicates and competed in competitions. This was a lady who expressed that she needed an extra banister fitted just to be able to get up and down stairs.“She was placed under surveillance. That showed her driving to drop off her children at school and shopping. She was seen walking independently without support.“She was brought in for interview but denied claiming any benefits dishonestly. She said her pain ied but was always there.“She said she had attended kickboxing clubs in Spilsby and Boston saying that it gave her mental focus.“This was a deliberate misrepresentation given to the health assessor.

Instead we are pursuing bilateral agreements with inidual Member States where possible, to apply in a deal or no deal scenario. We are pleased to have secured the first such bilateral agreement on local voting rights with Spain in January and we are continuing our discussions with other Member States. Mr Brake said the response showed how Brexit was tearing democracy apart due to callous Conservative Party self-interest.    He said: Far from illusions that Brexit would renew our democracy, it is instead tearing it apart and stripping people of their rights all because of Tory incompetence.Many EU citizens fill vital roles in the health service, our schools and across Parliament. They deserve better, and the Liberal Democrats demand better. The upcoming local elections are therefore an opportunity to send a clear message to Theresa May and Jeremy Corbynaposs failed leaderships by voting for the Liberal Democrats.Every Liberal Democrat elected in May is another voice fighting for a Peopleaposs Vote, with the option to stay in the EU.    Campaigners for EU citizens in the UK, themillion, said the potential loss of rights in May came on top of EU citizens being left without a vote in the  referendum. Ilse Mogensen, public affairs and campaigns officer for themillion, said: EU citizens living in the UK were denied a vote on our own future in the  referendum. To add insult to injury, we now face the loss of our right to vote and stand as candidates in local elections.

Justin Tomlinson admitted the inadvertent factual blunders while MPs debated triggering the cruel measure for the fourth year in a row.The freeze - which is now costing families up to £, a year - will kick in for millions this coming Monday.It passed without a formal vote because it was tied up with separate rises to pensions and disability benefit.But Labour warned the freeze on working-age benefits was pushing families and children into poverty.The errors were made as Mr Tomlinson commented about detailed elements of benefits policy during the -minute Commons debate.    The minister said the severe disability premium would increase from £. to £., when in fact he was referring to the the Severe Disablement Allowance. Severe Disability Premia for a single person have instead increased from £. to £.. Mr Tomlinson said the government would increase the basic and full rate of the new state pension by either .%, average earnings or inflation, whichever is highest. In fact, he should have said the government would increase the full rates of the Basic and New State Pensions by the so-called triple lock. Mr Tomlinson also said the pension credit standard minimum guarantee - the threshold below which pensioner incomes should not fall - would rise to £. for a single person.  In fact the correct figure is £., higher than the minister said. And finally, he said the plans would help the vulnerable to the tune of £.bn, when actually this figure was also higher at £.bn. Mr Tomlinson made the apology in a written statement to Parliament. He said: The Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order  maintains the Government’s commitment to the triple lock for both the Basic State Pension and the New State Pension.  The Order also increases benefits for carers, s and those with disabilities and long-term health conditions sharing the proceeds of economic growth with some of the most vulnerable in society. I would like to clary the points... and apologise to the House for these inadvertent errors. Figures in February showed a series of benefit freezes and caps since the Tories took power in  have cost families £ to £, per year. Tory DWP chief Amber Rudd faced repeated pleas to end the freeze before it kicks in on Monday, but failed to do so. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said there re no plans to renew the freeze after it ends in April .

Having demanded the right to take control of the process MPs have found it as dficult as Theresa May to break the deadlock. The indicative votes only indicated there is no majority for any form of Brexit. This is not quite the end of the process. They will seek to have another go on Wednesday in the vain attempt to reach a consensus.  There is still a possibility that Ken Clarkeaposs plan for a customs union, which lost by only three votes, could win the day. So far the exercise has only proved to underline how the toxin of Brexit has now entered the bloodstream of the two major parties, poisoning friendships and sapping traditional loyalties.    You could say MPs have finally proved they are in touch with the rest of the country – they are as ided on the issue as anyone . Mrs May will no doubt have greeted the results with a wry smile.  Her deal is not the only unpopular option on the table. But the Prime Minister still appears to have no plan for delivering a Brexit that can command the support of MPs. The chance of getting her deal through at a fourth attempt remains close to zero while the DUP refuses to budge and a diehard group of Tory Brexiteers refuse to take yes for an answer. Mrs May can neither tack towards a softer Brexit because it would split her party nor can she allow a no deal Brexit because it would provoke a Cabinet revolt. A general election could either see Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street oranother hung Parliament still unable to solve the Brexit riddle. There are no good choices facing the Prime Minister. Whichever one she chooses will come with a hefty political price.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the UKaposs most senior civil servant, says leaving the EU without a deal would hamper the police and security services, threaten national security, force companies to accept bailouts and undermine the Irish peace process. Quitting the EU without any sort of trade deal and relying on WTO rules, a move backed by ERG hardliners and some members of the cabinet, would also see a % spike in food prices. The letter emerged as EU chiefs warned the UK is facing the abyss with a No Deal looking more likely by the day. Guy Verhofstadt and Michel Barnier sounded the alarm after MPs rejected four indicative vote options for the future last night - leaving Britain in Brexit deadlock. Theresa May is now holding a four-hour Cabinet showdown to discuss either delaying Brexit or crashing out without an agreement on the April  deadline.

This morning it was announced itsand ambition had been slashed.  Last night, for the second time, MPs failed to back any alternative arrangements for leaving the EU in an indicative vote which failed to give any strong indications for a way forward through the gridlock. MPs have also rejected Theresa Mayaposs Withdrawal Agreement three times and voted against No Deal Brexit and against revoking Article .  The cabinet session today will start with a meeting of the apospolitical cabinetapos where ministers could discuss the prospect of a General Election. The Daily Mail reports that Sir Markaposs doomsday letter was sent to every member of the Cabinet last week. It will now be kept in Government files and could be released should a public inquiry be held into the handling of Brexit, which most polls show the public think politicians have bungled. The newspaper quote the letter as saying: A No Deal exit would enormously increase pressure on our law and security authorities and on our judicial system. The UK would be less safe as a result of this.  The paper claims a source said that Sir Markaposs warning on Northern Ireland has convinced the Prime Minister she could not risk taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Despite the grave warnings  Tory MPs, including  members of the cabinet, have urged Theresa May to take the UK out of the EU next week - evenshe canapost pass a deal. The Daily Mail says those ministers were Andrea Leadsom, Steve Barclay, Penny Mordaunt, Geoffrey Cox, Gavin Williamson, Brandon Lewis, Sajid Javid, Liz Truss, Chris Grayling and Alun Cairns.    Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said he had previously seen some of the same warnings in private briefings as a privy counsellor. But the Tory MP told the BBC he thought the warnings were ridiculous and a complete Whitehall scare story. A No official said about Sir Markaposs leaked letter: We donapost comment on leaks.  EU leaders will now be summoned to an emergency summit in eight daysapos time to discuss delaying Brexit. But EU chiefs today warned such a long delay would not be approved without a clear new plan from the UK.  And not only has the UK failed to draw up a new plan - it doesnapost even knowit wants to ask for a delay yet. Theresa May is expected to put her three-times-defeated Brexit plan before MPs yet again in the coming days. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliamentaposs Brexit chief, warned last night: A hard Brexit becomes nearly inevitable. On Wednesday, the UK has a last chance to break the deadlock or face the abyss.” Long delay or No Deal, Theresa May is likely to face a torrent of resignations whichever option she chooses.  Former minister David Davis saidthe Cabinet chooses a long delay it would be seen as a route to stop Brexit, adding of the Conservative Party: It would tear it apart. He added: You would see some bleeding away of people. More signicantly in immediate terms you would almost certainly have a leadership election of one sort or another very very quickly. And a new leader. And I think then all bets are off. It starts again, this process.  With Brexit deadlocked, the Times reported Chancellor Philip Hammond would use todayaposs Cabinet meeting to call for a second EU referendum. European Commission Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK now had two options - quit the EU without a deal, or seek a long delay. He said no deal becomes day after day more likely. Mr Barnier said: The UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry signicant risks for the EU. Therefore a strong justication would be needed. He added: As things stand no the option of no deal looks very likely. I have to be very sincere with you.  We have prepared for no deal. Itaposs not the option I would have gone for. You donapost need a negotiator for no deal, do you  You need a negotiator for a deal. And thataposs what weaposve done. But we are prepared. Weaposve done some serious preparation for this over a number of months now. Mr Barnier said the EU had always said it could accept a customs union, or a aposNorwayapos-style soft Brexit. MPs voted down both options but only by narrow margins last night. He added we are ready to rework the Political Declaration, part of the Brexit deal,the UK wanted to make soft Brexit happen. But he warned: If the UK wishes to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, thereaposs only one treaty available - this one.

Andwe had left on the original proposed Brexit date of March  then we wouldnapost have. In fact, the EU had even gone as far as to reassign our seats to other countries. But now, as MPs face yet more deadlock and Theresa May canapost find a majority for her deal, taking part in the EU-wide polls is seeming more and more like a realistic possibility. Which leads to a lot of questions - like when are they supposed to be held, andthey did go ahead, who would win  Well, read on - because weaposve got everything you need to know about the European Elections . When will the European elections happen  Across Europe, the elections to the European Parliament will happen between Thursday, May  and Sunday, May .The date will y depending on the country in line with their traditions or laws around voting. In the UK most elections are held on a Thursday - so the most likely date is Thursday, May .    Will Britain take part in the European elections  It all depends on what happens with Brexit. If Parliament agrees to a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU before our current departure date on April  then we will not take part. But any extension past April  will probably see the UK take part in the elections - and a long delay to Brexit. The UKaposs new MEPs would then sit until the UK exited the EU. The Electoral Commission has said that should the UK participate in the European election, polling day would most likely be May .  What changes and preparations have to be made to let us take part  To take part in the elections, the first thing that would need to happen is the government would need to amend legislation. This would likely happen when it made the necessary preparation to avoid leaving with No Deal. So it would happen on - or as close as is practical to - April th. Councils would then begin rushed preparations, with the support of the Electoral Commission, to make sure all the paperwork, polling stations and volunteers were in place for an election. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington gave council ing officers authorisation to pave the way for elections from April .    Last year the government gave the Electoral Commission £, to pay for its “activities relating to a European Parliamentary election in ”, meaning preparations were already underway. The deadline for candidates to submit their MEP nominations would be on April . On the EUaposs end, Britainaposs seats in the European Parliament have currently been redistributed to other member states - proportionally based on population. But they looked ahead and have written into the rules a way to dely that reallocation until Britain formally leaves the EU, meaning some MEPs from other countries may take their seats only after the UK leaves. How do the European elections work  The UK currently has  seats in the European Parliament, just under % of the  who make up the total. Unlike in Westminster elections, people donapost vote for a single candidate in their constituency.    Instead, the UK is ided into twelve constituencies. They are the nine English regions, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each is given a number of seats based on how many people live there. MEPs in the UK are elected by a closed proportional list system. Meaning the parties submit a list of their candidates for a region and the number of MEPs they see elected is based on the share of the vote they get.  Regions and the number of MEPs they elect East Midlands -  East of England -  London -  North East England -  North West England -  South East England -  South West England-  West Midlands -  Scotland -  Yorkshire and the Humber -  Wales -  Northern Ireland -  What is the current state of the British parties in the European Parliament  Labour  are the biggest British party in the European Parliament with  seats. The Tories have , the SNP have two, Greens three, Sinn Fein one and the Ulster and Democratic unionists have one apiece. But this is totally dferent from when the elections were held in . The biggest party then was UKIP, who won  seats and .% of the vote. But since then they have totally collapsed. Concerns over the partyaposs new hard-right direction and a number of personal squabbles.    The then UKIP party leader Nigel Farage now leads a group of nine defectors as the Brexit Party. UKIP has just seven MEPs left with other sitting as independents or one as a representative for the new SDP.   Who would win the election and are the parties ready  Basically, this is impossible to tell at the moment. Some people argue that fuelled by the idea of Brexit betrayal the elections would be a bonanza for far-right parties standing on a promise to fight the establishment. Others argue that because Brexit is such a big issue in British politics turnout would be a lot higher than the average as people would view it as a proxy for another chance to have their say on Brexit. Not that much polling has been done on the European elections but an opinion poll done for The Observer in March had Labour % ahead in the polls, with the Conservatives on %.    Rumours have been floating around that the Conservative Party has begun the process of preparing - and they have already asked their MEPsthey would stick around to stand again. Labour hasnapost said much about its election prep but it is understood to be making preparations for the pollsthey are needed. And The Independent Group, set up by MPs who defected from Labour and the Conservatives, applied to register as a political party in order to be able to fight European electionsthey take place this year.

To call the entire Brexit process a shambles is no exaggeration.

There is no guarantee a general election would produce a radically dferent Parliament or a route forward but asking the people what they would like is better than any other option. In the meantime, we urge May in the days and weeks she has left in Downing Street to listen to MPs and stop offering herself as a hostage to hard-line Brexit no-dealers both in her own party and Northern Ireland’s DUP.     One of the tragedies of this ordeal is that votes like those tonightwere not called two years ago to try to find a consensus. Twisting kne Theresa May, first as Home Secretary and now Prime Minister, should accept her share of responsibility for the surge in kne crime. Conservative governments have squeezed pay and pensions of teachers and nurses for nine years. Now, suddenly, they have been put on the frontline in the battle against crime. It is nothing more than rank hypocrisy The facts speak for themselves when May has issued marching orders to , police officers, punching holes in the thin blue line. Everybody has a role to play in ending this crisis, including educators and health workers. It is about time the PM accepts we need more, not fewer, police on our streets with the resources to do their jobs properly.

Support worker Charity Wilson, now , first met part-time chemistry teacher and author David, , seven years ago at a Christian group event. He fell in love with her at first sight and asked her out but as she was not looking for a relationship at the time, Charity didnapost take it seriously. After just three weeks of dating, Charity realised that she was in love with David and he casually proposed to her and she happily agreed. Within the space of eight months, they got married and they have been loved up ever since. Charity, from Cheshire, has two daughters from a previous relationship, and they call David their aposdadapos.    While they have received countless stares from strangers due to their age gap, the couple have never been fazed and feel stronger together after conquering many challenges together. Charity said: I wasnapost even looking for love, but we became friends and I fell in love. I wasnapost expecting him to ask me out, so when he did, it was quite a shock. What drew me to him was his personality and just looking at how handsome he is. We share the same faith and we have a lot in common due, so that played a very important role. But itaposs not just because heaposs Christian, otherwise I could have dated anyone from that event, but it was also his character and the way he handles himself - heaposs a real gentleman.    People ask me about our age gap, but you have to keep reminding me how old he is, for me it doesnapost even click in my mind, maybe when we are asked about our date of birth and thataposs when Iaposm reminded. But on a day-to-day basis it doesnapost really play any part in our relationship - heaposs my husband and someone I fell in love with and that Iaposm married to. Thataposs it. Iaposm very traditional, so David proposed, and I expected it because we both knew as soon as we got into a relationship that it was meaningful, so I saw it coming. He just said aposare you going to marry me thenapos while giving me a ring and I said aposyes, of course I will marry youapos. Charity says that they have received nothing but support from their families and her mum was charmed by Davidaposs aposlovelyapos personality. They have had a discussion about their future together and how their age gap may affect it, but according to Charity, she is not worried. Our families were surprisingly very supportive my family, who all live in South Africa, when I told them about the age gap, they were OK with it, she said.    The most important thing for them is that we both share the same faith, especially when you have to bring your children up with the same principles. He was kind and they spoke to each other on the phone before they met, and they realised that he was a lovely person and that was always the most important thing for my mum. He doesnapost look his age, he looks after himself, heaposs just my husband and we do things together we go for walks together, I cook organic food to feed my whole family and that plays an important part. We shouldnapost judge people whether itaposs race or with sexism and we canapost judge people by their age - itaposs ridiculous. You can find a twenty-one-year-old who is so mature and very responsible, or you can find a seventy-two-year-old who acts like a seventeen-year-old. We have to take people as they are.

Michelle and Scott Inglis were still dressed in their wedding finery after their reception when they arrived at the Hilton Leicester Hotel.The newlyweds had pre-booked a room and handed over their credit card to pay, reports Leicestershire Live.But when the transaction did not go through they realised they did not have enough funds to cover the room. Instead, they say they offered to pay £ on their credit card and the remaining £ in cash.  But they claim the reception staff refused the compromise, as well as other suggestions, and told the Inglises they could not stay at the hotel. Michelle, , and Scott, , who had wanted a night by themselves after their wedding at Leicester Town Hall and reception at Wigston Liberal Club, said they were forced to go home to their family. The Hilton has apologised for any inconvenience caused but said its staff were just following company policy. A spokesman added that bookings must be paid for by either cash or card, and that that was not possible in this case. Michelle said the wedding was amazing and that everything went to plan and everyone was having a great time, until she and her husband arrived at the Hilton. They said to me when I booked it in November that they donapost do card payment over the phone, but that wasnapost a problem so we agreed to pay on arrival - no problem, she said. The couple arrived at the hotel at about .am. We told them we had booked a room, and a member of the family had taken an overnight bag in the day before, said Michelle. She tried to pay for the room on her card, but the transaction would not go through. After the first time, I checked my banking app and saw that I had £, which is why it was declined, said Michelle. The room they had booked was £ plus £ per person for breakfast, making the final total £ for the stay. The new bride said she then askedit was possible to do a part-payment of card and then cash, which the hotel employee refused. After this, she said, she rang her mother to askshe could send her some money online. Her mum agreed, but the cash would not arrive until the morning. We askedit was at all possible to pay on departure, and again they said no, Michelle said. My mum then offered to pay on card over the phone and again they said no. They said no to every solution, so we were unable to stay. The couple got a taxi to their family home in Blaby, where Scottaposs daughter from a previous relationship and the coupleaposs two children were sleeping. We just wanted to have our first night as a married couple together, said Michelle, who tied the knot with Scott on Saturday, March , after  years together. We got back at about two in the morning, and were woken up by our children early in the morning. She added: I donapost normally complain about things, but how we were treated was just not good enough Hilton Leicester Hotel said that staff were following company policy. General manager James Howard said: “We have been liaising with the guest to discuss her experience and explain that we unfortunately were not able to process the check in due to a credit card decline.

Rising temperatures brought an abundance of food for the marine animals - sparking the largest barrel jellyfish influx in  years. Hundreds of the animals were found washed up across the South West coast following our warm spell. And one marine enthusiast said heaposd seen more of the creatures - the largest jellyfish found in UK seas - in the last three days than all of the previous  years. Rupert Kirkwood wrote on his blog, The Lone Kayaker: “There are more barrel jellyfish around the coast of SW England than I have ever seen in -plus years of sea kayaking.    aposaposI have seen more in the last three days than all the other years added together …  on Tuesday, + on Wednesday and + today.”Rupert added: “Their appearance seems to have coincided with a plankton bloomthat has probably been caused by the sunny weather .”He believes there could be “millions” in our waters. “As I paddle along I can see jellyfish beneath the surface up to about ft from my kayak, so I only see a tiny fraction of the vast numbers out there.    “The three locations I have seen them over the last three days are  miles apart so there must be millions of these large and mysterious creatures floating about around our coast.” The influx of barrel jellyfish means a large number are being washed up on our beaches. Journalist Lee Trewhela posted images of three jellyfish on beaches on Cornwallaposs Roseland peninsula last Friday. AK Wildle Cruises, in Falmouth, also tweeted reports of seeing lots of “huge” Barrel Jellyfish offshore. Barrel jellyfish warm in warmer coastal waters in late spring and often wash up on our beaches in May or June, sometimes in their hundreds.    They are the size of dustbin lids - giving them their other common name: Dustbin-lid Jellyfish. They are attracted inshore by plankton blooms which provide a plentul supply of food. They have eight arms, each frilly in appearance. These frills actually contain their small stinging tentacles which surround hundreds of little mouths. However their sting is harmless to humans. A member of Cornwall Marine Strandings Network told Cornwall Live it was not uncommon to see so many barrel jellyfish on the countyaposs beaches and its waters.

The teenaposs ex-partner Simone McDermott and her new girlfriend - along with two other women - can be seen battering Aimee, who repeatedly pleads let me go in the disturbing footage. Aimee had been lured to the beating by McDermott, who also got new girlfriend Melissa Marriott to take part too, the Manchester Evening News reports.    After the four thugs avoided immediate jail sentences on Monday, Aimee released the footage of her ordeal to show the full horror of what had happened to her. The footage shows the violence dealt out by the thugs, including Marriott and McDermott, who had recruited her neighbour Siobhan Wait to join in. A fourth women, Victoria Houghton, filmed the violence on her phone. All the attackers were aged  at the time they punched and kicked Aimee, who lay curled up in the foetal position on the floor while they rained blows onto her head and body as they laughed and called her names.   Now aged  and a bartender, Aimee, from Denton, criticised the suspended sentences handed down by the judge and told the MEN: I wanted them to docustodial sentences. They were saying in court they are young and that they have been through stuff but Iaposve been through stuff. I donapost go around battering people or jumping on people or even being mean to people.Iaposm annoyed about . I just donapost think justice has been fully served.

McDermott, she said, then sent her pictures of her in bed with her new partner Marriott. Sheaposs not a nice person, Aimee added. Manchester Crown Court heard McDermott lured her target Aimee, who was hopeful of a reunion, into a trap with a text that said aposI miss youapos. But Marriott led a brutal gang assault on her victim at a house in Crumpsall . Aimee is seen curled up in a ball as Marriott rained kicks and punches onto her head together with McDermott as they tried to snatch her phone and other attackers laughed.    Support worker McDermott and college student Marriott, now both , said they believed their victim had intimate pictures of them on her phone. Handing the four defendants suspended sentences at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Timothy Smith said Marriott had orchestrated a pre-planned, vicious, cowardly ambush and assault. McDermott and Marriott sobbed in the dock when they learned they would not be given immediate custodial sentences.    Prosecutor Katherine Pierpoint told how Aimee was in care in January  when she met McDermott, then also , when they were living in supported accommodation. The pair began a turbulent on-again-off-again relationship. But while Aimee was on holiday in Spain her lover began a new relationship with Marriott, then also , the court heard. The victim and McDermott were horrible to each other and would call each other names, according to the prosecutor.  Aimee bumped into her ex and Houghton, , on a tram at pm on January , . McDermott called her former partner names during a five-minute volley of abuse, prompting the victim to get off the tram. But that night McDermott contacted Aimee on Snapchat and apologised, adding she was depressed. She also lied, claiming that she had just split from Marriott.    McDermott askedshe could meet Aimee. When the suspicious victim askedshe was being set up, McDermott replied aposI miss you and she met her ex at a house in Crumpsall at am. The court heard Marriott led the attack, launching a series of Thai-boxing style kicks and stamping on the face of her victim. McDermott also kicked and stamped on her.    Houghton, a cleaner at Wythenshawe Hospital, kicked her in the head once while Wait kicked her legs and punched her twice to the back of the head. After being thrown out of the house, the victim dialled . Police found her on the street in an extremely distressed state. She was taken to hospital where a CT scan revealed no fractures, although she had signicant swelling to her forehead. The shocking video was replayed in court.    In a personal statement read to the court, Aimee, who now has a new girlfriend, said the assault left her too scared to leave her room and go out for three months and when she did finally venture out she had to have a friend with her. She said she struggles to sleep and suffers nose bleeds because of the repeated punches to her head. The court heard the injuries may have been worse had the attackers been wearing regular shoes rather than Ugg boots, which are slipper style footwear. Erimnaz Mushtaq, defending McDermott, said her client always accepted wrong-doing. She accepted it had been a deeply, deeply nasty incident but her client had believed the victimaposs phone had contained images of her. McDermott was deeply remorseful, it was said.    Brigid Baillie, defending Marriott, said her client acted because she believed the victim had aposintimate photosapos of her client on her phone and this seemed to wind her up. Her client had been suffering from mental health dficulties, the court was told. David Taylor, defending Houghton, pointed out her client was not the instigator of the attack and her actions had been totally out of character. His client was responsible for one kick during the attack and she had shown genuine remorse, he said, adding she she was totally ashamed and disgusted with herself. Mr Taylor said his client had not been in a physical relationship with any of the other defendants as she was not of that persuasion.  Patrick Williamson, defending Siobhan Wait, said his client had played a subordinate role amounting to one kick to a leg and one punch to the back of the head. At a sentencing hearing on Monday morning, Judge Timothy Smith handed McDermott and Marriott, both now , two years in a young offendersapos institution, suspended for two years. They were each ordered to carry out  hoursapos unpaid work and complete up to  days of rehabilitation activity. They were also ordered to pay their victim £ compensation each. Houghton was given  months, suspended for two years, in a young offendersapos institution.    Wait was given  months, suspended for two years, in a young offendersapos institution. Each of the four is required to complete  hoursapos unpaid work and must pay their victim £ compensation. All four were handed five-year restraining orders stopping them from making contact with Aimee. Marriott and McDermott, both of Gorton, admitted assault with intent to rob. Wait, from Blackley in north Manchester, and Victoria Houghton, from Benchill in Wythenshawe, pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Following the hearing, Aimee described how the assault had affected her le. She told the M.E.N: I have trust issues with people. I struggle to form friendships. Iaposve only recently got into a new relationship a full year after it happened.    Iaposm still very worried about leaving the house. I will only go out with my friends.

Kiara’s mother, Natasha Kinlan, has complained to police and has now spoken out in a bid to help catch the sick inidual responsible. Natasha, , from Springburn, Glasgow, said the mystery troll’s hate-filled messages are destroying her and her family. She said: “It’s sickened us. We have enough to think about without the extra stress of this.”    Little Kiara was diagnosed with brain cancer in January last year and despite undergoing a brain operation to clear away most of the cancer, doctors recently told her family there is nothing more they can do. Natasha said: “Kiara was diagnosed aged six after going into hospital with a shaky hand. The doctors found a five-centimetre brain mass and removed  per cent of it during a -hour operation. “This year, unfortunately, despite her ringing the bell at the hospital to say she was in recovery, we were told it had ed and was now at stage four. Doctors have told us she has only months to live.” Natasha and her partner Aldo Buonomo started to receive sick messages from the mystery sender shortly after Kiara’s diagnosis last year and they have continued ever since. Natasha said: “A couple of weeks after Kiara was diagnosed in January last year, we began to receive pictures on Snapchat saying ‘hurry up and die’ and they told us we were wasting NHS money. “They were calling Kiara ugly when she is clearly beautul.” Messages sent included a picture of Kiara with the caption: “Am dying yasss hurry up this time f* sake yous will never have to hear ma mongo horrible voice again.”  Another upsetting message said: “Ugly c*** Kiara will be deed soon.” The messages have continued over the last  months and have now become more sexually explicit in nature. Natasha said: “The way they are talking now is vile, about rape and other things. It is horrible. “I want these people brought to justice.” One of the messages suggested running over her brother AJay, .  Natasha said: “Kiara’s big sister Kayla has overheard conversations about the messages and was really upset. It’s making us feel sick.” The last message was received on Wednesday night when Kiara was rushed to hospital for an emergency operation. Natasha said: “Kiara had fluid on the brain last week and we didn’t knowshe was going to make it. We received the message when she was in theatre. “The person sending it clearly has something wrong with them. “The police are looking into this now and they have said they will charge whoever is guilty and take them to court.” Police Scotland said: “Police are aware of this and inquiries are ongoing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what happens you eat wetherspoons","story":"NewsWhat happens when you eat at Wetherspoons every day for a weekReporter Robin Murray ate at the pub every day for a week - Heres what he foundShareCommentsByRobin Murray:,  APR NewsThe Bristol Post reporter committed to a weeks worth of Spoons meals \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis year marks the th anniversary of a British institution. In  a then unknown Tim Martin opened his first pub aposMartinaposs Free Houseapos, opting to change the name to J.D.Wetherpoon a few weeks after an advertising board fell through the front window during a scuffle. Fast forward to  and Spoons is ubiquitous across the UK, employing , people in  branches.  It is clear that behind the chainaposs remarkable rise to high street power is its cheap drinks and long opening hours.But reporter Robin Murray, from The Mirroraposs sister paper The Bristol Post, attempted to get to the bottom of what  makes the chain so popular. Every day for a week he ate a dferent Bristol Spoons. Here is what he found out:    I should kick off by saying Iaposm a big fan of Spoons. It probably stems from a close relative of mine, whose main aim in le is to visit every J.D. Wetherspoon-owned pub in the country. Considering thereaposs around  of them, Iaposd say itaposs unlikely sheaposll manage it, but thataposs another story for another day. Anyway, given my admiration of the chain, you can probably imagine how quickly my hand shot up when my editor asked all the reporters in the office who would like to do a week-long review of Bristolaposs ious Spoons branches. Add that to the prospect of not having to make sandwiches every evening for a week, and I was well and truly sold. So without further ado, at lunchtime on Monday I left the office and headed to Tim Martinaposs empire for my first of five back-to-back visits, all in the name of research. There was plenty to find out: which is the best of all the clubs  Which Spoons has the best carpet  And how will eating at Spoons five days on the bounce make me feel  This is how I got on. It was a journey... Monday – aposChips cooked to perfectionapos   Spoons of choice:  The Commercial Rooms, Corn Street Meal:  Hummus and roasted vegetable wrap with chips and an orange Sanpellegrino .Given its prime location, Corn Streetaposs Wetherspoon restaurant is the chainaposs flagship Bristol branch, so it felt right to start my week here. Like many Spoons out there itaposs a grandiose building steeped in history, which somewhat juxtaposes what Spoons offers, some might say. Since there are no clubs on Mondays I thought Iaposd get the ball rolling with a veggie option before the unavoidable onslaught of meat came my way. And with a giant mural of Isambard Kingdom Brunel looming over me, I felt like I should order something a little more on the classy side to impress the big man. A hummus and vegetable wrap washed down with a San Pellegrino it was, then. Perhaps naively I thought I was going for a fairly healthy option by swerving a burger or something of that ilk, but my first thought as I bit into the wrap was salt. So much salt. Still, aside from that it wasnapost bad and I couldnapost help but enjoy the overall meal, especially as it came with the luxury of a San Pellegrino - arguably the most premium of all the fizzy beverages. And the chips were cooked to perfection, too - something which I later discovered isnapost always the case. For under a fiver I couldnapost really fault it. The Commercial Rooms got things off to a good start. Tuesday: Steak Club – aposPretty tasty but slightly greasyapos   Spoons of choice:  The Knights Templar, Temple Quay. Meal:  oz sirloin steak with chips and a pint of Shipyard American Pale Ale .This Spoons dfers from most others in Bristol, and indeed across the country, in that it doesnapost quite boast the same impressive architecture and could instead be mistaken as an office by passers-by,it were not for the neon green Spoons sign. Its location means it is often packed with workers from the cluster of nearby offices and commuters. When I went on Tuesday lunchtime there was just a smattering of lonesome diners - myself included. I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress behind the counter asked how Iaposd like my steak cooked, having gone in with the assumption a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak is a Spoons steak. But no, my slab of meat arrived promptlyand cooked as I had asked, and while it obviously wasnapost to the same standard as the cuts you get at the likes of The Ox, Mugshot or Pasture it was pretty tasty,not slightly on the greasy side. The chips were once again very enjoyable, the mushroom and peas were decent too, but the tomato was not. The pint of Shipyard, something youaposd often pay around £ for alone, made the £. fee an absolute steal. I was fairly impressed with the first club of the week. Wednesday: Chicken Club – aposFull yet disappointedapos  Spoons of choice:  The Berkeley, Park Street Meal:  Pulled chicken burger with chips and a pint of diet Pepsi .As a big poultry fan, Chicken Club was the one I was most looking forward to before I embarked on my Wetherspoon journey. The cycle across town to Park Street ramped up my hunger levels a notch or two and I was ravenous when I ordered my pulled chicken burger. My excitement was slightly dampened when I was informed that they had run out of the Jack Daniels honey glaze sauce a colleague had recommended. That was only a minor setback, however, compared with the awful chips that came with my burger. Unlike the previous two days they were disastrously undercooked and some were even stone cold. I probably should have mentioned something to one of the members of staff buzzing about but, given my hunger, I forced them down. The chicken was okay but covered in far too much barbecue sauce, and the bun it was served in was poor - barely toasted and a little on the stale side. I cycled back to the office, full yet disappointed. Chicken club had let me down. Thursday: Curry Club – Curry with a side of plastic Spoons of choice: Knights Templar, Temple Quay Meal: Rogan Josh with naan bread and poppadoms, washed down with a ginger beer . There was one key dference between my visit to the Knights Templar on Tuesday and my Thursday jaunt - on Tuesday there wasnapost a piece of plastic in my food. Yes, thataposs right, there I was happily enjoying my curry when I discovered a piece of plastic packaging underneath my naan bread.The irony is that I was just saying to my girlfriend, who had kindly joined me for lunch, it was the best Spoons meal Iaposd had all week thanks to succulent pieces of lamb and a tasty, perfectly spiced sauce. A minute before unearthing the unwanted item. Undeterred, I cracked on with the meal - having put the plastic to one side - and didnapost bother the waitress with a complaint, despite Rachael advising otherwise. J.D.Wetherspoon has since issued an apology, which is nice, and explained the packaging wasnapost used to wrap any of the mealaposs contents but instead came from a container in the kitchen. Friday: Fish Friday – The best food all week, but the worst service Spoons of choice:  The WG Grace, Whiteladies Road Meal:  Fish and chips with mushy peas and a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA .Before I get stuck into Fridayaposs review, I thought Iaposd describe my Thursday evening jog. I felt incredibly sluggish, having to stop for a walk after only about  minutes. Who knows, maybe it had nothing to do with the Spoons food but usually I feel much fitter when going for a run towards the end of the week, so by my reckoning it was probably the change in diet that made me feel like I was running with lead in my trainers. So thereaposs your aposscientic proofapos,you wanted it, that eating at Spoons every day doesnapost do wonders for your fitness levels. Anyway, The WG Grace proved to be hot and cold. It produced the best food I ate all week by a country mile, but was also where I found the poorest service.    Shortly after taking my seat, a waiter strolled past and plonked a plate of chicken wings in front of me. He was pretty much halfway across the restaurant before I could tell him they werenapost mine. Then a few minutes later a waitress askedthe wrap she was holding was what I had ordered. It wasnapost, so she took it back to the kitchen having not been able to locate its owner. And then, to complete the hat-trick of mishaps, my plate arrived with peas instead of the mushy peas I had ordered. The waitress wasnapost too happy about having to go and get it changed. However once my dish arrived- which I ordered using the impressive Wetherspoon app for the first time - it was top notch. The batter on the fish was nice and flaky and the chips were the best Iaposd eaten all week - far better than the soggy abominations I was served on Wednesday. After finishing my meal I felt a little bit sick, to be honest, and truly stuffed to the brim. I think I was done with Spoons by this point and could tell my body was craving some fruit and veg. What did I learn  The chips DO have an off-day The under-cooked, soggy excuses I was served at The Berkely proved this. More restaurants should adopt Spoonsapos approach to condiments I absolutely HATE those pathetic little pots of Ketchup and other sauces you get served at some restaurants, but at Spoons there are bottles of sauce filled to the brim everywhere you look - and not the cheap stuff, either. Bravo, Tim Martin, bravo.  Spoons carpets are WILD The carpets at Spoons are pretty impressive, arenapost they  I would love to know where they source them from.  Fish club is the best of all the clubs The fish and chips at The WG Grace were pretty darn good, it was just a shame about the shambolic service. Combined with a pint of Brewdog Punk IPA, it was my favourite meal of the week. Plastic and rogan josh isnapost a good combo Fortunately I didnapost eat the bit of plastic that was in my curry on Thursday afternoon, but it was still a little off-putting and made me question the care taken by kitchen staff.  Five days of Spoons isnapost conducive to a healthy lestyle This is hardly surprising, but I did not feel great after eating five Spoons lunches. As I waddled back to the office after my fish and chips on Friday, I was ready for a break from Spoons, dreading my fitness levels for Saturday morningaposs football match. Spoons service is hit and miss Over the week I found the service to be a mixed bag. Some staff were friendly but others were downright rude. The best were at the Berkely worst at the WG Grace.

The ward team will continue to monitor her physical observations regularly. The ATU where she is staying said it could not comment on an inidual case.

Not a single GCSE to her name. Despite having what the BBC describe as an aptitude for learning, the Queen didnapost have time for formal schooling, having to instead learn the constitutional monarchy ropes from a young age. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and ying degrees of success to show for it.  So just how well qualied are the royals  In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from .am until am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in , Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for the role which awaited her.  To this end, she received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. Formal education was not a priority of her parents. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping . Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didnapost harm her as sheaposs naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower. Breaking with tradition, Prince Charles was educated at Gordonstoun where he achieved five O-levels, two A-levels in historyand Frenchand a : degree in history from Cambridge University. Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a first.  Princess Diana met with less success and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland. Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, history and politics. While Prince Andrew attended Gordonstoun like his older brother, his academic choices were much like Anneaposs - six O-levels and A-levels in English, history and politics.    Perhaps unsurprisingly, Prince Edward also went to Gordonstoun and has nine O-levels, three A-levelsand a : degree in history from Cambridge. Bucking the preference for the Scottish boarding school, Princes William and Harry instead went to Eton. William got  GCSEs and three A-levels in geography , history of artand biologyand went on to get a : degree in geography from St Andrews University in Scotland.  As we all know, this was where he met his we, Catherine who graduated with a : in history of art. Harry chose a dferent path after getting  GCSEs and two A-levelsand joined the army. Itaposs widely thought  Princess Eugenie is probably the cleverest royalwhose two As and a B beats at A-level beat older sister Beatrice, who received an A in drama and Bs in history and film studies.    Beatrice went on to get a : from Goldsmithaposs in History of Ideas.

College student Abigail Harvey suffered fatal injuries when her Audi A was struck by the Iveco Stralus truck driven by Viorel Sandulache on the QEII Bridge in the early hours of November , . Abigail, from Basildon, Essex, was airlted to hospital in London but died three days later, Kent Online reported . Sandulache, , is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court accused of causing death by dangerous driving. He denies the charge but the jury has been told he does admit the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving.  Opening the case for the prosecution, Nina Ellen, said Sandulache, of Bradley Way, Grays, Essex, was driving for UK Mail when the crash happened. She said before the crash and while the lorry was moving two Google searches were made on the phone of the defendant. She told the court: The first search was for series one of a particular Romanian television programme. The second search was for series two. She said distinctive music could be heard playing in the background. He was driving towards Dartford from Birmingham when the incident happened. She said when the police investigated the crash they looked at footage from the lorry cab which showed the moments before the crash. Ms Ellen said the investigation concluded that Sandulache would have been playing that television show on his phone at the time of the collision. She said there were images which the jury may think showed the defendant gazing down and also show him appear to be laughing and smiling before the crash. She added: There was clearly inadequate distance between the car and the lorry and insufficient time to stop.  The court heard the defendant had his visual attention away from the road downwards for an extended period. Ms Ellen added: The Crown say he was watchingat the time of this incident. She also said: There was no hope at that point to stop in time and avoid a collision. She said his actions were inevitably dangerous. Ms Ellen told the court the defendant had a cavalier attitude to road safety and also said he had a conviction for speeding. When addressing the fact he had pleaded guilty to careless driving, she said he accepted his driving fell short of the required standard. But, she added: The Crown say the driving was much worse than that and fell far below. No drugs or alcohol were found in the system of  Sandulache when he was tested by police. When interviewed by police he did not answer all the questions put to him, the court heard. Ms Ellen said: He provided no specic account for the collision. She said both vehicles were travelling in lane one when the crash happened and the Audi appeared to have been driving slower. The maximum jail term for causing death by careless driving is five years, compared to  years for causing death by dangerous driving. The trial, which is expected to last a week, continues.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 12","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPIC:This beautul sunset across Loch Etive at Connel was taken with a mobile phone by Fiona McCuish from Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields need future plan","story":"NewsBob Shields: We need future plan for Ayr town centreRetail on our High Street is deadShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least five years ago – and certainly a whole elected council ago – I wrote on this page that Ayr town centre would have to change . . . or die. So please, allow me to confess that I actually got this the wrong way round. What I should have said was - Ayr town centre is going to have to die . . . and then change. And for better or for worse, that’s exactly where we are today. Our retail sector’s passing away was slow and painful. The ‘For Sale’ signs on our shop fronts began as a malady that grew into an illness - and finally became a virulent pandemic that was completely out of anybody’s control. The boarding up of a whole section of the “bottom of the town” was a warning symptom that our town centre was seriously ill. By the time BHS brought down their shutters for the final time – we were on le support. And our financial heart finally stopped beating when the leviathan that was once Hourstons was declared deceased on February . A post mortem in last week’s Ayrshire Post showed a record  shops in Ayr now lie empty. And alongside the report, a quote from council leader Douglas Campbell that . . “we have to ensure that our town centres become much more erse and about more than just shops”. I couldn’t have put it better myself, Mr Campbell. In fact, it’s almost exactly how I did put it . . . five years ago! To be fair to Mr Campbell and his Nationalist cohorts, five years ago they were languishing in opposition to a bullying Tory regime. While Big Chief Sitting Bill McIntosh ruled the class of  with  Tory councillors and some Labour nodding donkeys – the nine elected Nats sat in the naughty corner with as much power as my electric cigarette charger. After the  elections, it was role reversal. Labour jumped ship to prop up the Nats and now it’s the Tories who sit powerless – with a self-inflicted lurch from hapless to helpless. And following decades of Tory droning and dithering, the Nats of  looked like they might actually deliver something. Two years into their administration, we’ve witnessed everything from diddyness to dizziness. After last year’s budget farce and the great “Riverside Carbuncle” – the council tax paying public were right to wonderthis mob could run a tap - never mind a local authority! But in announcing their ambitious plans for a park, leisure complex, sports centre and the demolition of Burns House – we have to askour council has finally turned a corner that isn’t a blind alley  Have we reached that “rain in Spain moment” in My Fair Lady where the potty Professor Higgins finally says, “I think she’s got it!” Has SAC finally “got it”  Let’s hope so. If not – the “unprecedented funding” of £ million they’re ploughing into this will be the greatest waste of money in SAC history.The elephant in the room, of course, is the “building next to the Ayr Station”.How SAC can have a “vision” for Ayr town centre – without first resolving this nightmare – doesn’t make sense.Just in case they hadn’t noticed, the big sandstone thing draped in white IS the centre of Ayr!

The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think tank of Ayr partisans - and they’ve delved into the past to come up with a future. A key plank is to rip-up the dated one-way system and construct a new inner ring road circling the historic centre. That involves re-using the old rail bridge across the River Ayr and incorporating Miller Road. Their new plan - called The Bruce - is in its infancy. The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre.The #ADB advocates the entire bottom end of the High Street no longer being a shopping area, and all businesses relocated towards the top of the town. Spokesman Pat Lorimer revealed: “We looked at what was special on the  map then we added in the favourite shops, bars, cafes and walking routes. “You could argue  was the heyday of Ayr.” Though the Bruce Plan will not be published for several weeks, we can reveal a new traffic plan is a priority to replace the present shambolic system that confuses visitors. The new inner ring road system would not involve Sandgate at all. Pat said: “The current system was developed piecemeal without a master plan, that is why it is so hopeless. “When visitors come to town by car they actually have no idea where they are within Ayr because of the confusing road.” Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure. The metal bridge was finally removed in , long after the single track rail had been pulled-up. The Bruce Plan is named after King Robert the Bruce who burned the English troops out of Ayr. The Ayrshire Post revealed last week there are  empty shops and buildings in the town centre area. The river end of the High Street would be completely given over to leisure and heritage. The council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. Retired architect Pat revealed the group were “trying to run with” and help South Ayrshire Council rather than be against them. That’s despite the view the council has a poor executive compared to the way East and North are run. However, unlike Ayr Renaissance - which had a £,-a-year chief executive -they won’t be funded by the council. Pat said: “There is a great future for Ayr and we need to find it. “We need action, not another consultant’s paid for report and more talk.“We are a pressure group of like-minded people who all want to help Ayr.” Already signed up as members are Ronald Alexander, Toria Cassidy, Michael G Clark, Rob Close, Kirsty Darwent, Michael Davis, Peter de Moncey-Conegliano, David Dickson, Allan Dorans, Chris Fremantle, Christine Fremantle, Lianne Hackett, Nigel Hackett, Ali Logan, Patrick Lorimer, Andy McAvoy, Ian McKinnell,Norman McLean, Angela McNay, Alistair Paterson, Gordon Smith and Fiona Walker.

The deal Clic Sargent struck to sell the land and buildings to McCarthy and Stone hinged on planning permission being granted and the Prestwick development going ahead. But, with last week’s bombshell news that McCarthy and Stone pulled the plug on the project, the charity is stuck with a £.m white elephant. Clic Sargent agreed to sell the buildings and land in  and struck a £.m agreement with McCarthy  Stone. But when the developers unveiled their luxury flat plans they became embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work had to stop. And last week the developers announced they had pulled the plug on the project. Now it has emerged the entire deal was conditional on planning permission being granted and the development going ahead. Kevin O’Brien from Clic Sargent said: “We are hugely disappointed that the sale hasn’t gone ahead as we’d hoped. “Every day that this building sits empty it not only impacts on the people of Prestwick. It means that we are not able to provide vital support for all the children with cancer in Scotland who desperately need us. “Selling Malcolm Sargent House was a really dficult decision because we are extremely proud of its history and the role it played in the local community.” He added: “We continue to seek a buyer so that we can use this money to pay for vital services like our social workers and Homes from Home, which provide an essential leline for families when they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter said: “We now have a site that’s going to lie empty and Clic Sargent have no idea what they are going to do with it. “They also have a £.m black hole in their books. “It’s been a shambles.” In  a petition to save Malcolm Sargent House received nearly , signatures in just a week. Councillor Siobhian Brown, who launched the online protest, said: “I am sure in time it will be sold off again for residential development.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrPrestwickSouth Ayrshire Council"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14194803.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_280219_TENNIS_0045JPG.jpg","title":"south ayrshire tennis duo return","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire tennis duoto heroes reception after Special Olympics medal haulJack Dickson and Frances Smiley were both among the medals in Abu Dhabi.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR NewsJack receives a heroes welcome in Troon, left, and celebrates with Frances, right\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA tennis ace completed his dream week by bagging Special Olympic gold just days before turning .

Now Robert Dunlop has gained a criminal conviction for terrorising the people of Troon. The former Troon butcher, who turns  on April Fool’s Day, waged a letter vendetta against seven members of Troon Community Council. This reduced some community councillors to tears and one woman was so terried she now has a police panic alarm. Dunlop, of A Barassie Street, Troon, was found guilty on Friday by Sherf Scott Pattison of causing fear and alarm but not guilty of having a lock kne in Dundonald Road. His partner Krystyna Domanska, , was also on trial but was cleared of any involvement. Both had denied conducting the campaign between October  and September . Dunlop escaped with a slap on the wrist and has been warned to be of good behaviour for the next six months. His bail conditions banning him from approaching any of the community councillors will remain in place. This week a Troon Community Council spokesperson said: “We are very unhappy at the sentence but glad this man is now a convicted criminal. “He upset so many lovely volunteers in Troon and put us through the ordeal of having to give evidence in court. “It has been a very stressful time and we are all delighted this is now over.” Dozens of threatening letters were delivered to the home addresses of the community councillors. It was sparked when Dunlop lost the plot with the then South Ayrshire councillor Nan McFarlane, who had tried to help him in a benefits issue. The letters claimed the community councillors were involved in corruption, fraud and assault. Dunlop threatened to inform the public of this and claimed he was entitled to “bear arms and inflict violence”. The Ayrshire Post also received a nine-page letter, quoting an ancient Roman law called the Augustine Petition as the basis for the hostility. One y diatribe claimed all  South Ayrshire councillors were corrupt without providing any evidence. Other letters were despatched to South Ayrshire’s chief executive, legal head Ralph Riddiough, Troon police and the chief constable. Churches were also sent letters in a bid to blacken the names of citizens. Dunlop and Domanska made national headlines five years ago when the French village they were living in turned against them. They were accused of being neighbours from hell after building a wall, preventing the popular couple next door using their front door and nailing down their window shutters. The village mayor said the neighbours had been “terrorised” and Dunlop sent a -page letter to the French justice minister and an -page epic to then president Nicolas Sarkozy.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonScotlands CommunityAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thieving girvan florist ordered cough","story":"NewsThieving Girvan florist ordered to cough upLaurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February .ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsAnnabel Laurenson appeared at Ayr Sherf Court\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA thieving florist has made just one repayment on £ compensation ordered by a court, writes Edwin Lawrence. That was for £ - and was made over a year ago, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Yet social media pages during that time show Annabel Laurenson on days out all over south-west Scotland. They also show a new family car and pay-to-view sports channels in her family home. Laurenson was lucky to escape jail when sentenced at Ayr Sherf Court in February . She admitted stealing from the Nicola Jayne Flowers business in Girvan on dates between January ,  and December , . Laurenson was ordered to complete  hours of unpaid work, and to pay back £ in compensation to her former bosses. The total value of cash and goods she stole was estimated at much more than this figure.    And the hurt and distress caused to her former employers, who were also her friends, can’t be quantied. Defence lawyer John Gallagher last week told Ayr Sherf Court that Laurenson, , had completed her unpaid work. But he admitted the only repayment she has made was the £ she turned up at court with - on the day of her sentence in February last year. Mr Gallagher claimed Laurenson, of Girvan’s Maxwell Street, had hoped to secure a loan from her father. But he died in November, and the costs of his care and his funeral made this impossible. “She is unemployed, but her husband is in work, and she is well aware this has to be repaid,” said Mr Gallagher. The lawyer said the remainder of Laurenson’s father’s estate would have to be shared with her mother and siblings. “How much is she likely to inherit ” asked Sherf John Montgomery. “I’m not sure,” said Mr Gallagher. “But not enough to pay this back.”    “The time for repayment has lapsed,” said Sherf Montgomery bluntly. Mr Gallagher insisted that Laurenson was anxious to pay the outstanding £. He asked the sherf to revoke the original payback order, and instruct a new compensation order. Mr Gallagher said Laurenson could pay £ per month, and Sherf Montgomery agreed to the request. Laurenson had worked at the popular Dalyrmple Street business for many years, and was a trusted member of staff. Shop owner Nicola Jayne Purdie said she was ‘devastated’ to find out her colleague and friend was ripping her off. She said at the time of last year’s sentence: “She stole a substantial amount of money and stock. There has been absolutely no remorse. She hasn’t said sorry. I feel betrayed. This is a family business and we were working together for  years.”Nicola Jayne said the theft came to light after she noticed discrepancies within the business. Laurenson who shared family occasions with the Purdies, including parties, weddings and funerals, offered no explanation for her behaviour.

His father had just passed away and he ended up drinking too much.\"Sherf Peter Paterson said the behaviour merited a custodial sentence but added he could impose the alternative.But he warned: \"If you are back before the court again because of your drinking, you will be jailed.\"Hadden was given a  months Community Pay Back Order with supervision,  hours unpaid work and a four months Restriction of Liberty Order at his Hawthorn Road home between the hours of pm and .am.In addition he was told to pay pound compensation to each of the four women - the two customers, the bar employee and the police constable - he subjected to abusive comments."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-chef-michael-hoping-to-follow-in-famous-footsteps","story":"A CHEF from the Borders has made it to the final of a prestigious cooking competition after impressing celebrity judges with his culinary skills.Michael Cruickshank, who grew up in Newtown, will join five other talented young chefs from some of the countryrsquos finest eateries in the Roux Scholarship National Final on Monday, April .The winner of the scholarship, founded by chefs Albert and Michel Roux in , will receive training in a three-star Michelin restaurant.The Roux Scholarship, which funds all expenses, also provides the winner with the opportunity to travel across the world and a pound, bursary for professional development.Michael, who previously made the final of the competition in , currently works at the Michelin-starred restaurant Bohemia, in Jersey.Having come so close two years ago, he is looking to go one better this year.He told The Border : ldquoAfter getting to the final in , I see getting to the final is the minimum level I want to aim for.ldquoItrsquos been a crazy couple of weeks with a mixture of nerves and excitement.ldquoI had loads of help from my head chef, who gave me time to practise and take time out to come here today.ldquoAs Michel Roux Jr said, you canrsquot do it without people helping you.Michael made it to the final after wowing the judges with his interpretation of the competition brief, with a recipe utilising roasted hogget loin with hogget kidneys in a haggis-inspired faggot.The judges at the regional final, held in London, were impressed by the levels of creativity, technical skill and knowledge displayed by the chefs.Renowned chef Michael Roux Jr, one of the judges who sent Michael through to the national final, described the ldquoamazing standard on display.

Deloris is a Philadelphia lounge singer who dreams of stardom, but when she witnesses her lover-turned-gangster shoot one of his mob, she flees into the arms of good guy cop lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo .Delorisrsquo world is turned upside down when she is placed under witness protection in a rundown convent, disguised as nun Sister Mary Clarence.Although the adaptation does not feature songs from the original film, the musical repertoire is erse and magical.When we first catch a glimpse of the nuns, as they meander across the stage squawking like a bunch of demented penguins, I grimace. They are so out of tune I pray I donrsquot hear that god awful sound again.Upon learning that Deloris will be joining the convent, Mother Superior, played by Pam Graham, prays: ldquoDear Lordthis is a test, I cannot fail with you by my side. May she be of faith, of modestyhellip But she is stopped in her tracks by the voice of a brash American Deloris.Mother Superior continues: ldquoPerhaps the choir of angels drowned me out and you didnrsquot hear me Lord.Pam plays the exasperated Mother Superior prissy and clipped, with subtle comedy delivered in perfect tone.Of course things donrsquot run smoothly for the ghetto-fabulous a-turned-nun as you probably can imagine. It isnrsquot long before Deloris ruffles Mother Superiorrsquos habit and puts the nuns in danger, which leads to Deloris being given just one simple activity, joining the choir.Can she really unleash the songbirds trapped inside these nuns  This is when the show steps up a notch, and, although all dressed in habits, the audience can start to identy with the lead characters.In steps jolly Sister Mary Patrick, played by the enigmatic Claire Bell, along with Sister Mary Robertas the timid church mouse, and deadpan choir director Sister Mary Lazaruswho fully captured the gravelly voiced cantankerous nun. Her reprisal of the screen character is uncanny and garners lots of laughs from the audience.When the large ensemble of nuns gathered together, I did feel a sense of sisterhood and that they were each playing dferent characters despite having a minor role or no dialogue. Their pitch perfect delivery of lsquoRaise Your Voicersquo and lsquoTake Me To Heavenrsquo would draw the crowds into any church Irsquom sure.Playing the leading lady is no easy task, but in scene after scene Nicola embraces Deloris and puts her own sass and ghetto style into the character, belting out powerful tunes. To sum up her performance, what better words to use than those of Deloris Van Cartier herself ndash shersquos lsquoFabulous Babyrsquo!The last time I saw Lizzie Bell she was stumbling about drunk and shouting at a group of young kids, so I was shocked to see her convert to a Catholic nun. Of course, Lizzie was in character then as the vile orphanage boss Miss Hannigan, for Annie, performed by the Kids Innerleithen Theatre in November last year. The young actress shows true ersity, by portraying the meek Sister Mary Roberts with an enchanting solo performance.Although the female performances were powerful, they did not overshadow the male cast. Roger Brydon, Stewart Wilson and Colin Tweedie had me in tears as bumbling henchmen Joey, TJ and Pablo. Their comical performance of lsquoLady In The Long Black Dressrsquo didnrsquot leave females in the audience weak at the knees, but it did conjure up a few belly laughs!David Paterson was cast as Curtis who played the mob boss brilliantly, dominating the stage fiercely. And mild mannered officer Eddie Souterwho gave a cracking solo, proves he lsquoCould Be That Guyrsquo going from lsquoSweaty Eddiersquo to lsquoCool Copper, saving Deloris and winning her heart. A special mention to Jamie McCubbin, as the Irish Monsignor OrsquoHara ndashI closed my eyes Irsquod swear it was Father Ted!Needless to say the cast were at the top of their game, but anyone going to the show will no doubt be dazzled by the glitzy backdrop and detailed stained glass art of the fictional Catholic church.

The wood surrounds a lake of the same name, which is actually a reservoir created  years ago.Pressmennan Lake is nearly km long and meanders through the wood, giving the appearance of a river rather than a loch. In summer, the lush canopy of trees which surround the lake can engulf the senses, and for a moment you can be fooled into thinking you are in the middle of an ancient forest.And in a sense, you are. The wood is a fragmentary remnant of the ancient oak wood which once covered most of our county. Records show it existed in medieval times, and Irsquom sure well before that.Much of it was felled, so tradition tells us, when the warship The Great Michael was built on the order of James IV around . This ship was famously constructed using the oak woods of Fe, but such was the size of the vessel that wood from where was also needed, including Pressmennan.Yet the wood seems to have survived, and in  the felling of trees here is said to have been stopped due to its importance as a habitat for the kingrsquos deer.It remains a place rich in wildle. Roe deer still roam free amidst the trees here. They are creatures of woodland magic, and native to these isles. They are small and nimble-footed, and will dart into the undergrowth at the sight or sound of approaching danger. They have short antlers and a tailless rear, which usually has a white patch. This is the part of the animal you most likely see, as it quickly bounds away from you.The wood is full of other wildle: owls and bats, hares and foxes, stoats and weasels, and, according to the Woodland Trust Scotland, who own and care for the wood, otters have also been seen in the lake. The birdle here is likewise rich, and there is a crescendo of song in the spring. The trust acquired the wood in  and is slowly restoring it to its natural character, planting oak and other native trees.We arrived at the wood last weekend, on a day of changeable weather, but laden with the promise of spring. There is a childrenrsquos map provided by the Woodland Trust and it proved a great hit for my kids, who followed the loch-side path looking for the features identied.These are wood carvings and sculptures made by artist Robin Wood. Part of the trail includes doors and windows in the trees which are said to be the homes of magical creatures called the Tootflits and Glingbobs.My children, well-versed in the folklore traditions of our county, know all about faeries, brownies, selkies, kelpies, witches and wizards. But Tootflits and Glingbobs were new to them, and to be honest myself as well.They are mythical creatures created by the artist and trust to provide a sense of wonder and adventure for children as they explore the wood. You can search for their homes and the wood sculptures along the way.And so we set off on our adventure of discovery. The path by the riverbank needs care with wee ones when wet, but it whispers magic. Ancient oak trees line the banks of the lake, their branches dipping into the water.These old trees were still leafless, biding their time for the arrival of spring proper. But they were a spine-tingling sight, a reminder of what once was here in abundance. But then, as we ventured deeper into the wood, we made a less pleasant discovery.Some people had decided it was a good idea to hammer coins into the sculptures, and even into the living trees. We found the homes of the Tootflits, and at their door was a pile of rusting coins which had clearly been left as a gt or good luck charm. Rusting coins also lay all around the base of the tree.I understand the desire to leave a gt or charm for a magical creature, but polluting and damaging nature with the ultimate symbol of materialism was, for me, horribly ironic.We removed what we could, and my daughter Skye searched for a more suitable gt. She found a small lsquofaerie cuprsquo, which was the cupule of an acorn, and placed it on the doorstep.ldquoThere, she said, with a sense of satisfaction.We continued our search but we found every sculpture defaced in the same way. One had actually collapsed due to the splintering and rot caused by the coins being hammered into it.The final sculpture was a frog on a log. It too was peppered with coins hammered into its body. In the universal measure of things, this damage was insignicant and perhaps even well-meaning, for I assume it was done by people who came to enjoy the wood and merely wanted to leave their charm here.But eventhere was no malice, it was a desecration. Then my heart tore as I watched my children scrape their fingers as they tried to pull the coins from the poor creature. But they were mostly rusted and too well-embedded.As we left the wood, I was reminded of a famous quote, attributed to the Native American chief Seattle: ldquoTake only memories and leave only footprints.The word lsquophotosrsquo is often used instead of memories but the message is the same, and now more powerful than ever. Itrsquos a worldwide issue ndash the desecration of natural sites by people who unthinkingly want to leave their mark. The coins that werenrsquot rusted we put in a charity box.The experience affected my daughter.ldquoCan you write about what we found, dad, and ask people not to do that  said Skye at bedtime. ldquoAsk them to find presents in nature, like faerie cups or stones or fallen branches or pine cones or berries, or even make a love heart shape in the ground. Faeries donrsquot like metal anyway or need money.And I promised her I would. As she slept, I kept my promise."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-business-continuing-to-be-conducted-in-private","story":"Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeewas established by East Lothian Council last February after the British Horseracing Authority threatened to pull the coursersquos licence to race over concerns about its governance.Relations between members of predecessor body Musselburgh Joint Racing Committee were described as ldquofestering.It was made up of four East Lothian councillors and three members of Lothians Racing Syndicate , the latter representing racing interests.But the two factions were described in an independent report as having ldquoconsiderable mistrust, weariness, resentment and bitterness.Staff under the previous committee threatened to strike and there were claims of a lack of transparency surrounding their meetings and decisions.The independent report by Pinsent Mason was branded commercially sensitive by East Lothian Council, which refused to publish it until an investigation by the Information Commissioner led to a redacted version being made public.In February last year, the council replaced the old management committee with MRAC, giving the council a - majority over LRS.However, MRAC has held only four public meetings in council chambers in Haddington Town Hall since it was set up, with  of the  items of business on the agenda heard in private.On each occasion, the council has cited Local GovernmentAct , paragraph six, which allows it to exclude the public for ldquoinformation relating to the business affairs of particular persons other than the authority.East Lothian Council said that it ldquolooks to ensure that, as far as possible, committee matters are progressed in public.A spokesperson added: ldquoThe MRAC often considers matters in public session.ldquoAs with other committees, some reports may require to be held in private should they contain exempt information.Reports which have been withheld from the public include the current yearrsquos budget, financial reviews and racecourse general managerrsquos report.East Lothian Council is currently looking for a third-party operator to take over the running of the racecourse, which is on Common Good land.The hunt for a new operator is currently out to tender with hopes an appointment will be made before the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"prestonpans-shop-could-feature-on-bbc-show","story":"Corner Shop Cook Off is coming to screens across the country to show off the importance of local convenience stores in Scotland.The new show is presented by actress and musician Clare Grogan, with winner of MasterChef The Professionals Gary Maclean as the resident chef.Each week, a prominent Scottish chef will guest star, going head to head with Gary, only using ingredients from a selected local convenience store from around the country.The Day-Today on Redburn Road in Prestonpans has been selected as a possible store to feature on the show and,it is picked, the BBC portable kitchen will be set up in Prestonpans Town Hall for the event next month.The BBC said that it wanted the local shop owner and the customers to be the judges, adding: ldquoThis means we can really get into the heart of towns all over Scotland and show how essential the local convenience store really isIf confirmed, Corner Shop Cook Off will be filmed on April  and  in Prestonpans Town Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-as-prestonpans-charity-elcap-marks-its-30th-birthday","story":"The Lighthouse Hub hosted the event with a buffet, guest speakers and local musicians.Even microphone problems and a broken slideshow couldnrsquot dampen the mood as the birthday bash opened with two pipers from Preston Lodge High School Pipe Band.Bette Francis, member of the ELCAP board, hosted the event, introducing the speakers: chief executive Paul White, ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, and lastly a moving testimony from fellow board member Kirstin Doherty.Paul White, who was appointed chief executive five months ago, started the talks by outlining the importance that ELCAP played within communities, a point that was reiterated by guest speaker Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell.The final speaker, Kirstin Doherty, a member of the ELCAP board, has been supported by the charity since .

She called it Big Baby.She decided it was a girl and it became her favourite doll. It was soft and easy to cuddle, and Manja would take it with her everywhere.After years of being carried, played with and subjected to all manner of pampering with nail polish and make-up, the condition of the doll began to deteriorate.Then one day, Big Babyrsquos right leg came off! The seam holding the leg had torn and repeated repairs failed.At that time, I suggested we could replace her. But my daughter looked at me in horror: ldquoJust because she has one leg doesnrsquot mean I love her less.I remember being stung by my own insensitivity. Big Baby was not just an old doll, and I should have known that.Manja was six then. She is near  now. She has obviously grown in her games and play, yet Big Baby remains an important part of the family. But the loss of her dollrsquos leg led Manja into talking about disability. Over the years, it was a topic she wouldto when she was playing with her. She adapted clothes for Big Baby and refused to treat her as broken, or any less a doll.Then, recently, during one our story-making sessions together, she suddenly came up with this tale. We then wrote it down. I helped her with spelling and some phrases, but otherwise this is all her work and idea.I agree that children need to be taught empathy, but they often soon get it in ways adults forget, as I did. The discrimination and prejudice we encounter is taught by adults to children. Butwe listen to our children, they can often be the best teachers of understanding and empathy for us all.So here is Manjarsquos tale, which she titled The Magic Bracelet:Once there was an old man who had a foot which wouldnrsquot work and so he had dficulty walking.He had to use crutches and people said he was disabled, and because of this nobody would give him a job.So to get some money he would sit by the roadside and make porridge. Hersquod sell bowls of it to people who were walking by on their way to work. He told them that porridge was healthy and the best breakfast, which is true of course.So people would give him a penny for a bowl of his delicious porridge. That way he made some money.One day, while he was making his porridge, a young girl came and told him she would love to have a bowl of porridge but she had no money. The porridge maker gave the girl a kind smile.ldquoNever mind, he said, ldquoI always make extra just in case itrsquos needed.He handed her a bowl of porridge and she sat down and ate it. She was very hungry.As she gave the porridge-maker the bowl back, she noticed his crutches leaning against the wall.ldquoWhy do you have crutches  asked the girl.The porridge-maker looked sad and told her that he couldnrsquot walk very well because of his foot that wonrsquot work. He explained he needed his crutches to walk.The girl thought for a moment and smiled at the porridge-maker.ldquoI have a friend who can help you so you wonrsquot be disabled anymore, she said. The old man smiled at her, but this time it was a sad smile.ldquoThat is very kind of you, he said to the girl, ldquobut the doctors have told me that there is nothing that can be done to fix my foot, so I will be disabled for the rest of my le.ldquoPlease meet my friend, asked the girl. So the porridge-maker agreed.The girl helped him up and he walked slowly with his crutches with her. She took him to a beach.ldquoWait here, Irsquoll go get my friend, said the girl. The old man sat on the sand and waited for a long time. Eventually the girl ed.ldquoHere, she said, ldquotake my hand and Irsquoll take you to my friend. But first you must wear this shell bracelet.It was a beautul bracelet, made from dferent shells. He put it around his wrist.The porridge-maker went to pick up the crutches but the girl said: ldquoNo, leave them there, you will not need them.ldquoBut I canrsquot walk without them, he said. The girl just smiled and said: ldquoTrust me. So he did.She held his hand and slowly led him into the sea.He was hobbling at first, but the sea rose over his legs and his body got lighter in the water. Soon he was up to his waist in water.ldquoI cannot swim, said the porridge-maker, now feeling worried.ldquoTrust me, said the girl, ldquoI am wearing a bracelet as well, so we will e in together.So he trusted her and he ed into the water. Suddenly, he realised that there was some magic happening because he could breathe under the water. And he wasnrsquot cold or afraid.Then he saw the girlrsquos friend. She was a mermaid. ldquoWelcome, said the mermaid.ldquoYou see, said the girl, ldquoI told you my friend could help. The bracelet is magic, it gives you the ability to be like a mermaid and swim under the sea.The porridge-maker swam perfectly under the sea. He was not disabled under the sea. He could swim fast and he did circles and back flips. He smiled at the girl, this time a happy smile.ldquoThank you, he said. She smiled a happy smile back: ldquoMy friend said you can keep the bracelet and use it as often as you want.And so he did. And he realised it wasnrsquot his foot which made him feel disabled, but other people being unkind and making fun of him or treating him as useless.He still couldnrsquot walk well, but he knew he could breathe and swim under the water like a mermaid, while those who made fun of him couldnrsquot. And he could make the most delicious porridge ever. He understood now that although he had a disability, he was not disabled."},{"url":null,"title":"wallyfords-new-public-library-based-in-school-to-open","story":"The facility has been provided as part of the new Wallyford Primary School project at Futures Way to meet the demands of major new house building in the area.The library bears the name of Margaret Oliphant, a th-century writer from Wallyford.Born on April , , she died on June , .Alister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, has given support about local historical events which are reflected in the new building.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \"The community library has been named the Margaret Oliphant Library.\"The graphics on the internal windows, the old ship wheel from the former school badge and the external brickwork reflect aspects of Wallyfordrsquos history.\"This will be further developed in partnership with the community council and library over time.\"The library, which replaces the former library at Faside Buildings, has a separate entrance and exit when open for the public on: Monday and Tuesday, pm to pm Thursday, pm to pm Friday, am to pm and pm to pm Saturday, am to pm.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction. Who says personalities donrsquot matter in great historical events "},{"url":null,"title":"dennis-kelly-on-writing-matilda-the-musical","story":"ldquoFor a big musical, the show feels really theatrical, says Kelly, who wrote the show with composer and Edinburgh Festival Fringe favourite Tim Minchin. ldquoIt is polished, but it doesnrsquot always feel like it, which is great. To do the burp, we talked about loads of dferent ideas about how to do it and make it feel as though a burp had just happened, but in the end we went for something really simple, which works in big theatres, but which you could do in tiny spaces as well.The sort of spaces Kelly is talking about are exactly where the London-born writer began his play-writing career after joining a youth theatre while a teenager working in Sainsburyrsquos. His first play of note, Debris, was staged at the tiny Theatre , situated above a Battersea pub, in . He came to further prominence two years later when After The End was seen at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh in a production directed by Roxana Silbert for the Paines Plough Company.By , Kellyrsquos BBC Three sit-com, Pulling, co-written with Sharon Horgan, was en route to being nominated for a BAFTA, while his  stage play, Orphans, premiered at the Traverse in a Birmingham Rep production directed by Silbert. The same year saw the National Theatre of Scotland premiere Kellyrsquos play for children, Our Teacherrsquos A Troll. With such a relatively left-field back catalogue, being approached by the Royal Shakespeare Company, then led by former director of Glasgowrsquos Tron Theatre, Michael Boyd, wasnrsquot what Kelly expected to happen next.ldquoWhen the RSC came to me and said they wanted me to do a musical, I said I didnrsquot have a clue about how to do that, Kelly remembers. ldquoI think they knew my work from Debris and Our Teacherrsquos A Troll, and I wrote about three drafts and then Matthew Warchus came on board as director. They looked around exhaustively for a composer, and as soon as I spoke to Matthew about Tim Minchin, I think he knew he was the one.Minchin is the Australian-based performer, whose internationally renowned musical comedy show, Darkside, was an Edinburgh hit in , winning him what was then the Perrier Comedy Award for best newcomer. By the time Kelly and Minchinrsquos take on the story opened in Stratford in , both had been through an extensive development process.ldquoWe did four of these huge two-week workshops, Kelly remembers, ldquoand it was a lot of work. I donrsquot really like workshops, to be honest. I find that stuff hard. The first person I want to hear doing something Irsquove written is the actor playing the part, but with something this big you just have to get on with it and do it.Kelly reckons the entire process took about four years.ldquoSomeone said to me at the time that was ten per cent of my le, he says.Matilda The Musical looks set to last a lot longer than that. Following its West End transfer, the show opened on Broadway, and went on to win seven Olivier Awards ndash the most ever won by a musical ndash and five Tony Awards. It has also toured Canada and Australia prior to its current UK tour. Has such international success changed things for Kelly ldquoIn some ways it changed things, he says, ldquoand in some ways it didnrsquot. Irsquove had a show on for the last eight years, which feels strange. As a playwright you tend to have a show on, then it closes and another one goes on, so it is dferent with Matilda, but after all this time I donrsquot have a lot to do with it anymore. I donrsquot think Irsquom a lot of use to it. I used to go in and maybe give a bit of advice, but at some point yoursquove got to step back and let them get on with it.ldquoHow I wanted to work didnrsquot change. Itrsquos not like this was what I was working towards, meeting famous people and swanning round musical theatre or anything like that. I still write grimy little plays, and always have done, and writing Matilda was no dferent from writing anything  Irsquove done.Such a down to earth approach is part of Matildarsquos appeal. ldquoThere are two things I really like about it, Kelly says. ldquoThe first is Matildarsquos inability to accept the status quo, and secondly, she doesnrsquot whinge about it. A lot of the time in musicals, people say, oh,only this or that happened, I could have done this. Matilda never really does that. She just gets on with it and sorts things out. I think as well itrsquos a bit cheeky and a bit naughty as a musical. The great thing about Roald Dahl is hersquos rude, and Irsquom rude as well, and so is Tim, so it all came together because wersquore all rude. But apart from anything , itrsquos amazing seeing that little girl telling the story, and holding , people or a couple of thousand people, in the palm of their hand.Kellyrsquos forte charting the adventures of unruly small people has continued with his version of Pinocchio, which he wrote for the National Theatre in London in a production that ran in  and  directed by John Tfany, formerly of the Traverse and National Theatre of Scotland. In this way, Kelly seems naturally drawn to such fictional trouble-makers.ldquoBeing able to watch someone who is very small overpower someone who is very big, thatrsquos not a bad message, he says. ldquoI learnt very early on, kids hate things that arenrsquot fair. If you tell a kid off and yoursquore wrong, they hate it. I just love the idea that therersquos a little girl out there who gets up and sorts things out.

Four-fths of Scotlandrsquos peatlands are now listedas damaged.An army of expert contractors and volunteers from East Ayrshire Coalfield Environment Initiativecreated or repaired the  hectares of peatland, including  within the Muirkirk Uplands Site of Special Scientic Interest.CEI manager Daisy Whytock said: ldquoPeatlands make up one-fth of the land cover in East Ayrshire, and much of this area has been degraded in some way.ldquoThe peatland restoration work carried out by the CEI, its partners and local land owners has the potential to benefit bioersity, the environment and local people.The work at Muirkirk was carriedout over winter with the help of Sorn Estates, which will farm the moors.Between December  and February , specialist peatland restoration contractors installed more than , dams and water-retaining bunds across a dense network of old ditches to re-wet the degraded peatland.Peat-forming Sphagnum mosses and bog plants can now grow in the blocked ditches and will slowly seal them with new peat.This work will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve local water quality and protect habitat for rare species such as hen harriers, curlew and Large Heath butterflies.A healthy bog acts like a sponge, capturing rainwater during storms and slowly releasing the filtered water into local river catchments throughoutthe year.On drained peatlands rain water pours into ditches and watercourses carrying eroded dry peat. This contaminates water courses and increases the risk of flooding. By blocking drainage ditches, local rivers and communities will benefit from improved water quality.These special wetlands are home to many rare plants and animals that are specially adapted to the soggy conditions. Draining the bog makes it harder for these wet-loving species to survive and prevents the formation of new peat.Peat is formed from partially-decomposed plant material that accumulates in the wet, acidic conditions. As they grow, peatland plants trap carbon from the atmosphere that is then stored as peat below the bogrsquos living surface.Drained peatlands release vast amounts of carbon back into the atmosphere. It is estimated degraded peatlands contribute . per cent of global, man-made CO emissions. The peat soils at Sorn Estate are more than ft  metres deep in some places and the work carried out by CEI will help keep the peat locked away. A wet surface covered in bog mosses will also capture more carbon from the atmosphere, helping to combat climate change.More than % of Scotlandrsquos land area is covered in peaty soils. Largeareas have been damaged over centuries, with extensive damage to the core peat reserves and its specialised vegetation.Scottish Natural Heritagersquos Peatland Action said Scotland losing the carbon stored in our peat soils would be the equivalent of more than  times Scotlandrsquos annual greenhouse gas emissions.

This week, as parliament debates the climate change bill, theyrsquove invited the oil and gas industry to lobby MSPs right outside the chamber.ldquoItrsquos clear that on climate policy, like many other issues, Labour is at war with itself and canrsquot be trusted.Dr Richard Dixon, FoE Scotland Director, said: ldquoThis is sadly symptomatic of the many MSPs who apparently see no contradiction between supporting the expansion of oil and gas extraction and action on climate change.

Member who asked the questiona no deal Brexit could expose lamb exports to a . per cent plus €. kg tarf. Is that going to be good for our sheep farmers ”Responding on behalf of the government, the Rt. Hon. Robert Goodwill, minister of state for fishing and farming, said: #The best way to prevent a situation in which we have a no deal Brexit is to vote for the deal. Nothing yesterday was supported by the House. The deal is the best thing for agriculture, the best thing for the future, and the best thing for a long-term relationship between ourselves and the European Union.Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “For Brexiteers to talk about the post-Brexit agriculture industry being of #paramount importance# while cheerfully voting for a #no deal# Brexit that could destroy it, smacks of hypocrisy. Our farmers and crofters need to realise that those who promote #no-deal# Brexit are not on their side. They are prepared to damage the livelihoods of our livestock farmers and crofters to pursue their Brexit unicorns.“The test for any deal the government comes back with for our rural communities, must be whether it allows them to continue to access key European export markets.

Waste cooking oil, lubricant oil and garden waste would need to be taken to  Bossack.Businesses wishing to do this should note they would need to register as a waste carrier with SEPA . There is currently no charge for this for many businesses.It’s also important businesses understand they need to register with the council ahead of taking waste or recycling to Bossack or Chinglebraes, to avoid delays at the gate — or possibly being turned away.Businesses can set up a trade waste and or recycling collection service with the council.Darren Richardson is the council’s head of infrastructure services. He said: “We’re issuing these reminders now to help businesses avoid falling foul of SEPA and possibly incurring fines.“Equally, we’re keen to spread the word amongst businesses that recycling where possible is not only a legal requirement, but it can also save them money.“It’s far cheaper to separate out recyclates than it is to dispose of these items in general waste. It also contributes to the Zero Waste Plan for Scotland where targets proposed include recycling  per cent of all Scotland’s waste and only  per cent of remaining waste ending up in landfill by .“The situation is slightly dferent on the isles with regards to recycling — so we are writing separately to isles businesses.“We’re here to help all businesses and we’d encourage any local business, no matter the size, to contact usthey’re unsure about what they need to do or wish to establish a recycling or waste collection service with us.”Resources and information for businesses is regularly updated on the council’s website and any business, large or small, who is unsure of whether their waste and or recycling is classed as commercial waste should get in touch with the council’s Waste Team on .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The subsidy is unlawful state aid and it will disturb the market.”The company decided to go to Scotland’s highest civil court after an announcement from the Scottish Government last month. The ministers had decided to name three companies who are bidding to provide ferry services between Aberdeen and Orkney and Shetland.Final tenders for the contract are expected to be submitted by the end of April  and the successful firm will receive a subsidy estimated to be worth around £ million.Legal papers lodged in the case show that Pentland Ferries seeks a declarator from the court that the proposed subsidy is unlawful and breaches obligations placed upon the government by EU law.Today saw lawyers for the Scottish government argued that the ministers had acted lawfully.Having finished hearing from both sides, Lord Boyd said he’d issue his decision at some point in the near future.See next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian for the full story.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Interviews will cover veterans’ experiences and their thoughts on remembrance.“It is important that these stories are captured now before they can no longer be shared, ensuring greater understanding for future generations.#What’s more, our research has shown that audiences are keen to understand more about recent conflicts and the experiences of our veterans.”The veterans will be asked the same set of questions giving a unique insight into their experiences and views at dferent times in history. Poppyscotland will also conduct group interviews to allow intergenerational interaction.The completed body of work will be available to view on the charity’s learning website and made available to schools. The short video clips will help the public to develop a better understanding and engage with veterans, and have greater appreciation of more recent and less well-known conflicts.If you are a veteran and would welcome the chance to tell your story, please contact Veterans’ Voices researcher Hannah Uttley on   , or atveteransvoices@poppyscotland.org.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The clarion has been called, all roads now point to independence as the only show in town.There’s no doubt the Brexit omnishambles is pushing folk towards “freedom” with Indyref coming to a cinema near you shortly. Theresa May has started talking backwards like something out of Twin Peaks and everyone who doesn’t work as a political journalist has given up on trying to make sense out of the whole sorry saga.Polls and stuff on Facebook say that two thirds of Scots who are “undecided” about independence, believe Brexit makes it likely and more than half would now opt for the Tunnock’s Caramel WafersBritain leaves the EU without a deal. : Kevan Christie: What Plato had to say about BrexitThe time has come to tell the Eton Rles where to go – Rees-Moog, Dominic Saab, Boris and the like can do one.

With schisms in both the Tory and Labour parties, there is no end in sight to the misery, no matterNoel Edmonds finally gets his Brexit Deal or No Deal passed in the House. The whole thing has been a disaster from beginning to end and it’s no surprise that more people are toying with the idea of voting for independence when it inevitably comes around again.I feel there is a season of goodwill towards Scotland in the European Union. The likes of Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier know we are not supporters of this Brexit bampottery and voted for no such thing. Not in my name. Perhaps, they’ll let us join the EUwe go independent or at least let us stay pals via the EEA or EFTA routes.If Indyref does come about, let’s make it swt and above all be nice to each other. The opportunity for Scotland to be a cool wee Tommy Robinson-free country is within reach, but we cannot allow the SNP to dominate.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in .

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were.

They need tangible changes now, not months down the line.“Teachers are entitled to a safe working environment in which their wellbeing is safeguarded. Their Employer has a legal duty of care for them, which at the moment it is failing to deliver.“We hope that the Employer will agree to engage meaningfully with the union to address members’ concerns fully so that further strike action can be avoided.”The school will remain open this week despite the strike action.The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools called on the NASUWT to continue to engage in attempts to resolve the dispute and said the outstanding issues would not be resolved through strike action."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one of our most unique and historic resting places","story":"There are no signs directing visitors to Tullyrusk graveyard which sits in the expanse of fields beyond the Ballymac Hotel. And there isn’t even a road to it. This graveyard is a precious relic of old Ireland that has been forgotten by all except those whose relatives lie there.Dúlra only learned about it from a reader who had happened upon the cemetery while out for a walk. The reader had mentioned that there were yew trees in the graveyard, and it was those trees that finally caught Dúlra’s eye or he wouldn’t have found it at all.And so he walked through a farmer’s gate towards a circular mound in the distance that is raised above the surrounding rolling fields that sweep down towards Lough Neagh, up the stone steps and in through the double iron gates. And what Dúlra found was a beautul, remote, wild resting place with stunning views over much of Ulster.It’s a graveyard from the mists of time. In ancient days it was a church whose name has long been forgotten which was reputedly founded by St Patrick. A thousand years later it was demolished by Cromwell. The foundations of the church are still visible, along with a holy well nearby.Indeed, the church at Tullyrusk was so famous it got got name-checked in story written in Armagh way back in the s.The gravestones reveal a mixed clientele – Catholics and Protestants made equal by the Great Leveller. Simply known today after the townland Tulaigh Ruisc, the hillock of the march, the oldest legible gravestone inscription dates from  . The most recent, as Dúlra was soon to discover, was last Friday on the day of his visit, a poignant reminder that in Ireland, history and the present day are rarely separated.A century ago cultural activist Francis Joseph Bigger called Tullyrusk the “last of the old burial places left to the ancient stock”, and said that a hundred years previously, the old Irish keening would wail around the crumbling walls during funerals. Some say it can still be heard in the wind after the burial of the old clans, he wrote.But the grave of one heroic resident of Tullyrusk remains unmarked. A local man called Armstrong was condemned to hang in Lisburn in  after messages from the United Irishmen were found sewn into the lining of his waistcoat. As he awaited the gallows, his we and children were allowed to see him, begging him to save his le by turning in his comrades.“Do not tempt me, mo chroí,” he told her. “My le is only one, and God will watch over my widow and children.” If I inform, he said, many “wives would be made widows and hundreds of children left fatherless”.As Dúlra walked through the small graveyard, its ground uneven due to the multiple burials over centuries, he thought of the distraught widow burying her husband that summer’s day in , her children gathered around her. There could have been few sadder sights in the tragic history of this land.Dúlra was making his way around the old gravestones, doing his best to decipher them, when a gravedigger arrived. “This graveyard is rarely used for funerals nowadays,” he said. “I’m called here once a year at the most.”Dúlra left before the funeral cortege arrived – access is through a nearby bungalow and the coffin is usually carried across the fields amid the glorious backdrop as has been done for countless centuries.Dúlra could not think of a better place to lie, below the beautul yew trees in one of the country#s most unique and historic resting places.A place apart, overlooking Lough Neagh and beyond, and alongside countless generations of a proud people. * If you’ve seen or photographed anything interesting, or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"air ambulance at scene of ongoing incident in co antrim","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Full UK-wide participation in the customs union and single market is acceptable to the DUP because it does not leave Northern Ireland aligned to the EU in isolation.It would maintain a soft border, debunking the persistent myth that the DUP wants a hard border.On Wednesday, the DUP opposed harder Brexit options - such as customs union membership alone - because it would not remove the backstop on which the May-EU withdrawal agreement rests.The DUP also rejected Labours fantasy option of membership of a customs union - asthere is an a la carte menu of such unions - in which the UK would miraculously continue to have the right to its own global trade deals and input to those of the EU.Belatedly, the dferences between the European Research Group - obsessed with Brexit - and the DUP - preoccupied only with Northern Irelands equal Brexit alongside the rest of the UK - have begun to be laid bare. Boris bin, ditch and junk the backstop Johnson wont be getting a repeat slot at the next DUP conference.Having used the event to launch his Conservative Party ascendancy, any fidelity to the DUP dissolved the moment Theresa May said \"support my backstop deal and theres a leadership vacancy\".Shameless is too inadequate a word.Et tu, Jacob Ill only changethe DUP moves Rees-Mogg, you changed as the DUP held steadfast. The DUP conference gig could have been yours, Jacob. I was looking forward to the first such gathering to be addressed in Latin.Many continue to criticise the DUP. The extensive support for the backstop across Northern Irelands business and farming communities shows a determination that economic logic ought to trump constitutional politics. Seamless access to EU and UK single markets matters, protecting livelihoods.To those at risk, this matters more than unproven claims that Northern Irelands unique alignment to the EU single market would be a constitutional betrayal, jeopardising the Union.In trying to persuade the DUP onside, the UK Government has made clear that it will not allow regulatory ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In other words,EU single market regulations change, the Government will adopt them across the UK to protect Northern Irelands EU and UK trading relationships.The problem is that the DUP will not trust successor governments to honour that pledge.A certain mythology has developed over the seamlessness of Northern Irelands place in the UK single market.A reader, Alan Brookes, contacted me wondering how many people recalled that some British people from where in the UK could not work in Northern Ireland from  until  without a work permit.Such permitswere issued only to qualied essential workers, with notable exceptions such as members of the Armed Forces, religious ministers and teachers.Under the old Stormont regime, the Safeguard of Employment Act was designed to create local jobs for local workers. Brookes recalls his final interview with a Northern Ireland engineering firm in . \"When they asked did I need a work permit as I was born in England and I stated I did they immediately cooled and I was informed it would be too dficult\".There have long been checks on certain commodities travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and identication is always required.None of this has threatened the Union, but it has highlighted the distinctiveness of Northern Ireland.If the backstop worked well, it might possibly stem the rising demands of nationalists for constitutional change via a border poll and shore up the Union. After all, Northern Ireland only looks vaguely secure when it is economically prosperous and politically ing.Rarely, in other words.The DUPs intransigence has been matched by the EU steadfastly refusing to change a single word of the withdrawal agreement.There might be something faintly ridiculous about the chancelleries of Europe standing paralysed before Sammy Wilson, Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster, but its where we are.The DUP will never back the backstop in its current form. Amid all the noise, the party has at least been consistent, wanting a deal, but clear that no backstop removal equals no deal.What more can Theresa May do to sell her agreement given she has laid down her political le for the bargain  Rename it St Andrews perhaps The withdrawal agreement is as unsellable to the DUP as it is unchangeable for the EU. Mays promise to stand downher deal passes could be the longest resignation note in history. It is utterly irrelevant to the DUP. And the DUP do not fear a general election.Charting a way forward,the DUP does believe that UK-wide customs union and single market alignment to the EU solves the backstop conundrum, why not vote for it, rather than abstain,another opportunity arises For the DUP, its all about UKexit, not Brexit.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of books on the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed alevel league table for northern ireland catholic schools dominate top positions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Teachers are being told that they must teach relationships and sex education in an integrated way and that,necessary, they should be able to remove young people from some parts of their lessons, but not others.\"As I see it, the Government could address the problem by amending the regulations, either to mandate that sex education and relationship education be taught as two separate subjects or to ensure that the right of withdrawal continues to cover both sex education and relationships education. \"The latter decision seems to me more sensible and would be very easy to make.\" The DUP has been approached for a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"berlinborn polar bear cub named hertha after local football club","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is vital our leisure services are made welcoming for our entire community.Council chairman Mark Murnin welcomed the move and said he was delighted that families with children with autism could enjoy the same facilities as families in Newry.Committee chairman Cllr Gareth Sharvin said he had raised the matter with the February meeting.The move was also welcomed by Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.The news has been welcomed by Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group which has been working with the council on the proposal.Group chair Aacuteine Sloan welcomed the move, saying ldquoit will now make this first class facility accessible to all.She added: ldquoIt will give local autism families the opportunity to use the pool and feel more relaxed alongside other families that understand the struggles that may arise. I hope this is something that continues after the trail period.ldquoWe are also hopeful that the council will source fully qualied special needs swimming instructors soon too so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan business gains contract with leading aircraft firm  ","story":"AIRCRAFT manufacturer Dornier Seawings has contracted Ballygowan precision engineering company McGreevy Engineering to machine parts for its iconic Seastar amphibious aircraft,.Dornier rose to prominence in the s and s as a manufacturer of large, all metal flying boats.The Seastar, designed in Germany, is engineered to operate from runway and water surfaces allowing for short field take-off and landing capabilities.Representatives from the local company met initially with Dornier Seawings at the Farnborough Airshow last July and subsequently gained a number of contracts.The Ballygowan firmrsquos managing director, Aaron McGreevy, said it was very pleased to be working with Dornier Seawings, a multicultural and multi-national joint venture between the Dornier family and two fully state-owned Chinese enterprises.ldquoGiven our recent investment to ersy our capabilities this is great news indeed, said Mr McGreevy.ldquoThe Dornier brand has a heritage of a pioneering spirit.

A Rhys OrsquoDonnell box kick was marginally long and carried back with interest before quick hands from Crosbie put his winger in for a superb try.The conversion left the game in the balance at -.The home side continued to dominate possession and territory and a Reaney penalty following a great breakdown turnover from skipper Aaron Cairns gave them a little breathing space.Old Belvedere, despite showing admirable invention, were guilty on occasion of overplaying and a series of errors meant they were pinned back in their own half.The bonus point score went to Cronin who drove over the line when Adair was held up just short and with  minutes to go Hinch looked certain of victory at -.A superb defensive effort then kept their Dublin opponents at bay in relative comfort until the th minute when the pressure eventually led to an overlap to leave the away side in with a chance of a draw as the game reached its final moments.However, in their desperation to run the ball out of defence and keep the game alive, Old Belvedere conceded a penalty which Reaney knocked over to clinch the win.That should have been the end of proceedings, but a penalty from a scrum led to another Belvo charge and they were awarded another penalty which Crosbie slotted with the last kick of the game to take two points back to Dublin.Ballynahinch continue their winning run and stand level with Old Wesley at the top of the table with two games to go.Ballynahinch Old Belvedere AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Best friends laid to rest after accident  ","story":"BEST friends Shane McAnallen and Martin Patterson were buried side by side on Saturday.The two men in their twenties died together in a car crash on the Carlingford to Omeath Road in the early hours of Monday, March .It is believed they died at the scene and that no other vehicle was involved.Mr McAnallen was from the Castlewellan area and Mr Patterson was from Bryansford.Their tragic deaths, and that of missing Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire who also died in Carlingford over the St Patrickrsquos holiday weekend, left the community numb with grief.A community candlelight vigil was held in Carlingford on Sunday night which was attended by representatives from the deceasedrsquos families and rescue and emergency services.All three were connected to Bryansford GAC mdash the young men were former under-age players while mother of three Ms Maguire was the clubrsquos under-age coach.Mr Patterson also played for a time with Ballynahinch RFC U-s.He and Ms Maguire were also connected to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Newcastle.Ms Maguirersquos children attend the school and she was active in the St Maryrsquos Parent Support Group while Mr Patterson was a fondly remembered past pupil of the school.Ms Maguire was also known through her work as a casual leisure attendant at Newcastle Centre and also as a nursing assistant at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.The  year-old had been reported missing from a group of friends on a hen night while there were out socialising in Carlingford on Saturday.An extensive land and sea search was carried out on Sunday.On Monday, her body was recovered from the lough around the same time as the deaths of the young men became public.Mr McAnallen and Mr Patterson, also known as Marty Patt to friends, were laid to rest in separate ceremonies with many local people attending both services.A funeral for Mr McAnallen was held in St Malachyrsquos Church in Castlewellan early on Saturday morning.

local councils are being encouraged to provide financial support for the Air Ambulance Northern Ireland.The appeal has been issued by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who last month secured across-the-board political support from his Newry, Mourne and Down Council colleagues to provide funding to the service which plays a critical role across the district.It has been revealed that between August  and November last year, the air ambulance responded to  incidents across the council area.ldquoThe air ambulance is vital for people across the district, given its rural nature and attractions like the Mournes and Strangford Lough, Cllr Walke rsaid.The Rowallane politician recently visited the air ambulancersquos base outside Lisburn where he was joined by two of his party colleagues from Mid Ulster and Derry and Strabane Councils, both of which have agreed to provide financial support for the lesaving service.With three local authorities already on board, Cllr Walker hopes that the remaining eight Northern Ireland councils will provide financial support.He said while Stormont funds the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment, it should be picking up the remainder of the servicersquos running costs.He confirmed that Strangford MP Jim Shannon plans to raise this issue with Department of Health Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly.ldquoDown District is already a main user of the air ambulance service which has already helped save a number of lives, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoThe service relies heavily upon donations to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs and while this is welcome, I believe local councils and indeed the Department of Health needs to do more.Cllr Walker says while the air ambulance relies heavily upon public support, it also needs a sustainable funding stream to ensure it can continue to save lives and hopes this will be provided by the Department of Health.ldquoThe service is a key component of the emergency services and should not have to rely on charitable donations, he continued.ldquoGiven the costs to keep the service in the air, I believe all of the Provincersquos  councils, supported by the government department, have a role to play.Cllr Walker, who was recently made aware of the excellent work of the air ambulance when the crew responded to an emergency in Killyleagh when a woman was involved in an accident in Plantation Street, confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos financial contribution to the service will be agreed at a meeting of its efficiencies working group.He added: ldquoThe air ambulance is an excellent service which all of Northern Ireland is fortunate to have and it is important that we continue to support its

the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough is seeking a meeting with local politicians.The Lecale Lightkeepers want to meet face-to-face with Newry, Mourne and Down councillors to spell out why the beam must be retained and why the proposed LED replacement suggested by the Dublin-based Commissioner of Irish Lights is totally inadequate and unacceptable.Campaigners have also submitted a Freedom of Information request to the local authority for copies of all correspondence between the councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Department and the Commissionerrsquos office on the lighthouse issue.Last month, the local authority was heavily criticised for excluding the press and public from a meeting mdash billed as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe.The council subsequently confirmed the workshop, held at the local authorityrsquos headquarters in Downpatrick, was a ldquopreliminary information session for councillors and that prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for the future of the lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation would take place.The workshop lasted well over one hour but the report from the behind-closed-doors session which has been sent to councillors amounts to a paltry two and a half lines.Signicantly, the paper does not detail the questions put by councillors or, most importantly the response from Commissioner officials, compounding the frustration of those seeking to retain the beam.They are angry that the council report provides no detail whatsoever of what was discussed and simply states the issue of the lighthouse beam will be raised at district electoral forums across the district.Campaigners insist that as the Commissioner of Irish Lights had the opportunity to put its case before councillors, it is only right and proper and in keeping with equality legislation and good old fashioned fairness, that the Lecale Lightkeepers should be afforded the same opportunity.The campaigners have been exchanging correspondence with council officials and described one response confirming the sweeping beam issue will be discussed at ious district electoral forums with a view to having a joint meeting with Captain McCabe, which the public could also attend, as ldquodismissive and derogatory.The Lecale Lightkeepers have also vehemently rejected the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be the ldquomost appropriate forum to address the issues they have raised.A spokesperson for the campaign group said councillors were keen to protect the iconic, sweeping beam, describing plans to remove the mercury bearing which rotates the Fresnel lamp due to health concerns as ldquoflimsy and flawed.They have also rejected claims that a new LED light proposed by the Commissioners would be the same, arguing this ldquosimply isnrsquot true.Campaigners say it is their understanding that some councillors are at a complete loss as to why the local authority is denying them a chance to meet all of the councilrsquos  members to state their case.They say Commissioners were in Downpatrick last month because councillors voted unanimously to invite them for a meeting to discuss the controversial plan to replace the sweeping beam with what, in their view, is a much inferior light.ldquoThe irony of what is happening is not lost on us, said the spokesperson for the campaign group.ldquoCouncillors discuss the issue of the sweeping beam and unanimously agree that it should be retained. They propose to meet with the Commissioners which happens but yet when campaigners ask to meet with all the districtrsquos elected representatives at one time, we are denied this opportunity. Why The spokesperson added: ldquoWe hope councillors will demand a detailed account of the recent workshop so the views of the Commissioners can be critically examined and scrutinised by not only campaigners, but elected representatives, to determinethey are accurate.ldquoIf, in our opinion they are not, we should be given an opportunity to refute them in front of councillors who were elected to represent the people of this district and who are accountable to them.ldquoIf changes are made at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse, the historic character of the sweeping beam will be lost forever. We must all stand together and ensure this does not happen. What is being offered by the Commissioner is inferior to what we currently have.A council spokesman said officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums.He explained this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for St Johnrsquos Lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.The spokesman added: ldquoRequests for details of future public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar food sauce firm in deal with Aldi  ","story":"PREP House Sauces in Crossgar has won its first business with discount retailer Aldi in the Republic of Ireland.Prep House is a family business which has won a string of national awards for its original sauces and dressings.Itrsquos now supplying its pepper sauce to Aldi for its network of  stores across the Republic.Managing director Paul Bell, who took over the management reins of the company in , described the new deal as ldquoa marvellous boost.ldquoThis very important business for us resulted when we swtly followed up a lead from Invest NIrsquos Drew McIvor, he added.ldquoOur approach was well received by the Aldi buyer who was extremely interested and very supportive.

I am confident that the completed public realm scheme will signicantly enhance the ambitious plans to develop a new retail and commercial centre at this part of Downpatrick.It was confirmed recently that the former police base will not be bulldozed as part of the ambitious multi-million pound plan to regenerate this part of the town.The building mdash which enjoys protected status mdash is to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project which, in addition to new retail and commercial space, could also include an element of housing provision.Council officials insist the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and view preserving the former station as an opportunity and a challenge, insisting it very much remains part of the overall development project and potentially could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.To date, senior retailers including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in opening new premises at the proposed retail complex which will be built on a huge area of land stretching back as as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue.A council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that while the public realm works were scheduled to complete on March , a utilities company was required to undertake work in Irish Street before the public realm contractor was able to get on site.She added: ldquoDue to unforeseen circumstances experienced by the utilities company on site which required their attention, it resulted in a delay to the completion date of the overall public realm scheme.

We are appealing to anyone who knows the identity of those involved to pass that information to the police.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoWe do not want another summer of trouble, the community group chairwoman declared. ldquoPeople are very shocked at what happened last week and the fact that it was pensioners who were targeted.ldquoThe protest was a direct response to what happened last week and an opportunity to send out the strongest possible message that this behaviour will not be tolerated.Ms Perry added: ldquoThe clear evenings will soon be here and it is important that the community stands together and demonstrates that there is to be no more trouble.

He said that in addition to the trauma of suddenly losing a young child, they now faced the added pressure of having to have their child flown to England for post-mortem.Mr McGrath said it was his understanding that the issue impacted on around  families a year, highlighting the importance of doing everything possible for families.ldquoThere are a number of considerations here, suggested Mr McGrath. ldquoWe have to consider the period of time to conclude the post-mortem andthe child to their family for burial.ldquoI am very heartened to hear that the present model involving Liverpool is maintaining the turnaround times. What is also of the utmost importance is supporting the childrsquos family and I am glad to hear that there are bereavement support teams here for families.Mr McGrath added: ldquoThis is not going to be an easy process, however what is absolutely vital is that we get the right long term solution and my colleagues and I will be pressing the government department for that.ldquoCllr Trainor and I met departmental officials to ascertain how we can progress matters for the peace of mind of families here.Explaining the background to sending babies to Liverpool for post-mortem, Cllr Trainor said the paediatric pathologist who was involved in carrying out these procedures in Belfast moved from his current post and there was no one available to fill the position.ldquoFrom our meeting, it is apparent that there is a shortage here of paediatric pathologists and this is why the link with Liverpool has been implemented as a short term solution, he said.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoThe Department of Health is also looking at the possibility of an all island approach. However, such a process would take some time to develop as we look at the possibility of a standardised level of care between north and south.Local health campaigners are also seeking a meeting with senior health chiefs to discuss the issue of child post-mortems being held in Liverpool.The Down Community Health Committee believes thatpriority was given to funding and enticement for the training of pathologists, post-mortems could continue to be carried out on a regional basis.At one of its recent meetings, Mrs Anne Trainor, suggested that the possibility of pathologists travelling to Northern Ireland periodically from England, Scotland, Wales and further afield could be considered.She described the decision to perform post-mortems in Liverpool as ldquosickening and immoral and argued health officials should have done more to continue the service.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoFor women who have had a miscarriage or whose baby dies, it is the single worst thing that is ever going to happen in your le.ldquoYou will lose parents, aunts and uncles, husbands and wives, but you will never experience the pain and heartbreak of losing a child. For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.

As a starting point, dementia care and in particular the lack of dementia care beds in Fermanagh at present has been very prominent.”Parents feel ‘abandoned’ by long waiting times for autism diagnosis Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingThree year-old missing N.I. boy is foundNI road closed after serious two vehicle collisionMulti-vehicle collision closes major NI roadDual carriageway closed after serious road traffic collisionlsquoAwesomersquo, lsquoExcellentrsquo and lsquoWonderfulrsquo -

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

[]js  djs.id  idjs.src  \"embed.playbuzz \"fjsThe Prime Minister has already staked her future on the passing of the withdrawal agreement, saying to backbenchers she will quit ahead of the next stage of the Brexit negotiations provided her deal passes.This means the country is likely to see a Conservative Party leadership contest or a general election, and a new Prime Minister.

Who are the favourites Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt lead the polls for the Conservative Party hopefuls. Mr Gove is the bookies favourite at   and is seen by many to be a good choice to take charge of the next stage of the Brexit process. Conservative MPs would need to forget his betrayal of Boris Johnson in the  leadership race when he ran against Mrs May instead of supporting the former Mayor of London.Boris Johnsons stock is still high in the party, with many seeing him as the obvious hard Brexit choice from outside the cabinet. However, his time as Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London was prone to gaffes, and the Brexit bus still sticks in the memory of many voters.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is third favourite according the bookies, and would need a similar surge at the polls as the party had in  to challenge for a majority.As the longest-serving Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt is seen as a safe pair of hands for the top role and backs a harder Brexit than other cabinet colleagues. This stance and his reputation could edge him ahead of the likes of Sajid Javid, Amber Rudd, and Matt Hancock.The long shotsMatt Hancock has publicly backed Mrs Mays deal throughout and is considered part of the next generation of Conservative talent and could be a dark horse.

Belfast Power wants to built the huge plant at Belfast Harbour, which could produce up to half of Northern Irelands electricity at peak times Now, the Department for Infrastructure has issued a notice of opinion to approve the massive development. The firm behind it says  jobs could be supported during the build, with  full-time roles once it’s operational. Work is expected to start in autumn, with the plant up-and-running by  Ciaran Devine, director of Belfast Power Limited said the green light comes at a “critical time for Northern Ireland’s electricity industry, and the power station will play a central role in ensuring we have enough electricity to meet demand over the coming years. “The project also represents a signicant sht towards low-carbon electricity generation in Northern Ireland. Using state-of-the-art Siemens technology, it will be the most efficient of its kind anywhere in the UK and Ireland. “This is good news as we continue the journey towards decarbonisation and will ensure competitive costs, which will benefit consumers. “At a time of considerable uncertainty, we’re proud to be bringing this level of investment to Belfast, which will result in the creation of over  full-time jobs when construction begins and over  full-time roles when the plant is operational. “DfI has been thoroughly professional in its approach to the application since it was submitted in April . Belfast Power Limited will in the coming days participate in the T- capacity auction, which is being overseen by the Utility Regulator to secure electricity generation for the period commencing September .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/meade_1.jpg","title":"david meade has his mind on international markets","story":"Posted on Monday  March  by Ulster Business David Meade, the renowned international keynote speaker and broadcaster who runs David Meade Events, on creating one of Northern Ireland’s most exciting success stories Whether it’s winning a million dollars from a Las Vegas casinoor being mistaken for a numerologist and receiving hate mail for allegedly predicting the end of the world, David Meade has had an eventful few years.

Asked how he had ersied into events and keynote speaking from being an on-stage mentalist, David says: “I’ve actually been delivering events and keynote speeches very successfully in the UK and Ireland for a number of years, but I suppose most people know me for my tours and the more corporate side of my business was lesser known. “I moved into this space roughly seven years ago because I love inspiring and motivating people and it was a natural move to work with companies who want to inspire their teams to be innovative and the best they can be.” David believes there are even more opportunities outside our region and this year the company is investing over £, to take advantage of them. This includes investing in new video learning services, enabling people to access David’s bespoke training services remotely, from wherever they are in the world. “Over the last number of years, the company has grown at a phenomenal rate and this latest investment was a no-brainer because we simply had to respond to that growth.” David says: “We are still based in Northern Ireland, but there is a huge untapped market that we want to explore further. The world is getting smaller because of technology and we want to meet the challenge and work with people all across the globe. So far in  we have contracts in  countries, including Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland and many more are in the pipeline.” David’s list of international clients reads like a who’s who of the biggest and most impressive organisations in the world including Apple, Hard, Mercedes Benz, Adobe, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, British Airways and Canon. David attributes his company’s success and ability to attract such high-level clients to its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the market. “If the uncertainty of today’s marketplace teaches us anything, it’s that you must evolve and that’s what we’re doing – keeping up with the ever-changing market and meeting the ever-increasing demands, both in Northern Ireland and across the globe.” One of the company’s most exciting innovations has been the development of a bespoke in-house video production studio. This has greatly enhanced its capacity to produce media projects for its clients. Allowing clients to access the bespoke training remotely means the firm can compete all over the globe. This view of the company, as competing on an international stage, is a vital part of David’s approach to business and informs the business decisions he makes, including this recent quarter of a million-pound investment. He explains “The investment in our video learning service means we can deliver training to clients in any corner of the world, at any time. Thinking of ourselves as part of a global economy, rather than just the Northern Ireland economy has been key to shting the company up a gear.” He has grown to a team of  and this year the company is expected to achieve a turnover of £m, an impressive milestone for any company but something David considers not a destination or even a point to slow down, but simply a  to push on to bigger and better things. “As the company continues to thrive and grow every year, I find myself looking at new and innovative ways to keep up with demand. Hitting that £m milestone will be energising and whilst I’m proud of the work my team have done here, I’m already thinking ‘OK, what’s next ’ With this investment, our ability to evolve and the international demand for the services we provide, there’s so much more we can do.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"stormont departments compiling emergency no deal brexit contingency list","story":"Posted on Wednesday  March  by John Mulgrew Stormont departments are building a key list of emergency contacts across business and the wider sectors amid contingency planning for a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Ulster Business can reveal. It’s understood departments have begun contacting companies, organisations and business groups as part of “Brexit contingency” ‘no deal’ planning, in order to “locate someone who can assist them in normal working hours and out of hours”. An email seen by Ulster Business, sent by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , says in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario “time will be of the essence and identying the correct people to help solve any problems or issues in a very short space of time will be critical”. It’s understood the Department for the Economy and the Department for Infrastructure have also made contact. A Northern Ireland Civil Service spokesman told Ulster Business: \"Since the UK Referendum, the Northern Ireland Civil Service has engaged in a signicant programme of work which covers a range of issues that arise as a consequence of the UK leaving the EU. \"Over recent months, there has been a greater focus on no deal planning across government, including the contingency plans that would be necessary in the event of a no deal outcome. \"The Northern Ireland Civil Service has been engaged in this process and plans have been developed on a ‘reasonable worst case scenario’ basis. \"These contingency plans are under constant development as we continue to engage with key stakeholder groups and partners in government.

Now, George Lowden has taken the biggest step in his career and paired up with a global superstar to develop an instrument for the masses, writes John Mulgrew If you first began making guitars as a boy in Bangor, it’s perhaps not surprising that after  years your instruments are among the greatest in the world. Now, George Lowden’s journey has taken its biggest step in decades – teaming up with one of the world’s biggest pop stars to produce a range of more affordable instruments George’s guitar-making story has taken many turns in the last few decades, from making small numbers himself, to larger-scale production and outsourcing, before moving to his current Downpatrick home and building some of the most beautul and acoustically rich-sounding instruments. They are regularly in the hands of people like English folk hero Richard Thompson and Pierre Bensusan, but have also graced the stage along arguably one of the greatest players of a six-string instrument, Eric Clapton. In fact, the former Cream and Bluesbreakers man took to the stage at the Grammy’s in  with a Lowden – forgoing the Martins which he had, and has, used throughout his career. But the next step in the Lowden journey came something out of the left field for many in the industry, and players alike. George and managing director Ausdahl took to the NAMM show in Anaheim, Calornia alongside Ed Sheeran – collaborating on a more affordable range of instruments. The most interesting part of that, from a production perspective, is the guitars will still be made in Northern Ireland, while the majority of the big US makers outsource production of cheaper ranges. “It all started about five years ago with Gary Lightbody when he was using my guitars,” George told Ulster Business. “I made one for Ed Sheeran. I thought, he uses small guitars and we don’t have them. “So, I decided to design one. I went up to the north coast and spent about a week there – thinking and drawing, and designed what is now the Wee Lowden.” After that, Ed used the guitar for recording, and it spurred on a relationship with the instruments which led to the new partnership. “I definitely didn’t want to outsource the production, having had experience of that in the s, with licensing there are limitations – particularly when it comes to quality control and design. “I decided,we do this, we are going to do it here. The challenge of course, is salaries and productionare higher than the Far East, for example. I had confidence that because of the tech available – the careful marriage between hi-tech processes, and more traditional hand processes.” “One of the interesting things is,you examine guitar-making worldwide, in the Far East the processes tend to be more hand made, because labour costs are very low. “In the US, the processes are more machine orientated. I wanted to develop some ground-breaking processes, which I think will be taken up by other companies in due course, but also keep some of the very important hand processes, most importantly hand carving the internal bracing system.” For acoustic guitars, the bracing inside the instrument is one of the keys to the overall tone of the instrument, along with the wood selection – and resonance – and the quality of the build, parts and set up. “That’s not a small challenge for us. We have to train young people to use sharp chisels. But I have found in the past, people have reasonable hand-to-eye co-ordination, so can pick it up quickly.” And from the volume perspective, George says he’s already pre-sold three quarters of the first year of production. That’s starting off at around , instruments a year, but growing that “considerably higher” in year two. Speaking about the burgeoning relationship between George and Ed Sheeran, managing director David Ausdahl, says it was a meeting of minds which focused on simplying design while retaining high build quality and tone. “There was a trecta of requirements. Not compromising on quality, doing it here and making it accessible to a whole new market and a whole new price point. George never moved out of that space. “We have had unprecedented demand. People were coming across the standand some hadn’t previously known the company. It gives them an introduction to a new market. “Young people are able to get engaged with the guitar, and make music.” If you aren’t familiar with the existing handmade Lowden range, prices start at around £,, while guitars using more exotic woods and parts can quickly rise to the cost of a small hatchback. But George is kicking off the new Sheeran by Lowden range at less than £. “We realised, for young people, that a price point of say £, is what most young people aspire to. One of our aims, both Ed and I realised, all too often, young people who want to take up guitar and write songs. They buy a guitar which is the best they can afford. But it’s uninspiring, has a hard tone and is dficult to play – far too many of them would just give up. “we could produce a guitar, that doesn’t have the cosmetics, butwe can make one that sounds really good, at an affordable price, something worthwhile.” To keep costs down, Lowden has cherry-picked production priorities, retaining hand made work for areas such as the internal bracing. “We also clearly did not want the two ranges to encroach in others territory.” He says existing players have already taken an interest in getting their hands on the new Sheeran by Lowden instruments. “From a commercial point of view, it’s a large market but obviously it is more competitive than the high end market Lowdens. I personally have to be very proud of what we do, and I feel, as long as I’ve done my job, I feel confident it’ll be a great success.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gas_1.jpg","title":"work to start on m ni gas scheme","story":"Posted on Monday April  by Ulster Business A proposed £m natural gas storage facility in Co Antrim has taken a step forward after an engineering design firm was appointed to the scheme, it has been revealed.InfraStrata wants to build the facility at Islandmagee.
