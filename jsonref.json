Unvaccinated travellers currently must get a negative Covid-19 test within one day of departure.Dilek Kalayci, health senator in the state government of Berlin, said there were also several more suspected cases of the new Omicron strain in the city of 3.6 million people. So far, little is known about the new variant, but there is a risk of a further spike in infections due to a faster spread of the virus, Kalayci said in a tweet. “My plea: Reduce contacts! Keep distance! Wear a mask!”, she added. On Wednesday, the public health office in the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said four people had tested positive for the Omicron variant even though they were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. They had only mild symptoms. We’ll have more on this as the story develops.  The news comes after a man who attended an anime convention in New York City in late November tested positive for the Omicron variant when he returned home to Minnesota, marking the second case of the variant in the US and leading officials Thursday to urge thousands of convention attendees to get tested. The Anime NYC 2021 convention Nov. 19-21 drew about 50,000 people, according to event organisers, and attendees were required to wear masks and show proof of having received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.As usual, some numbers out of Australia for you.  The state of New South Wales has recorded 337 new locally acquired Covid cases today and no deaths. Numbers are also out in Victoria, which has recorded 1,188 new locally acquired cases, a drop on yesterday’s numbers. The state also recorded 11 deaths overnight. Federal health minister Greg Hunt has said all the Omicron cases in Australia have been “asymptomatic or very mild”. Hunt was on the TV morning programme Sunrise, saying authorities were “cautiously optimistic”. Plans to invite all adults for a booster jab by the end of January were announced on Monday, but healthcare providers have yet to be told how the NHS is expected to ramp up vaccination services. One NHS trust leader said the only way to hit the deadline would be “to stop less essential and more routine work” at a time when waiting lists are already at records levels. The National Audit Office (NAO) warned on Wednesday that the backlog for NHS care could reach anywhere between 7 million and 12 million by early 2025. Another senior trust leader said: “We don’t have enough staff to manage the vaccination we have now, it will lead to a massive additional load of work. The chances are it will take staff away from the services we’re still struggling to get running.”Amid concerns over the Omicron variant, the government was accused of sending mixed messages about whether people should change their behaviour in the festive period despite no laws prohibiting social contact between healthy people. Sajid Javid became the latest to weigh in, contradicting the work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey’s warning against kissing strangers under the mistletoe. Meanwhile, guidance issued to civil servants in the Home Office on Wednesday, seen by the , said they could celebrate with colleagues, but urged people to “take sensible precautions”. Read the full report here: According to new evidence collected by the country’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), the latest epidemiological evidence suggests that Omicron can evade immunity from infection with earlier variants and is causing reinfections at three times previous rates. “We believe that previous infection does not provide protection from Omicron,” said Anne von Gottberg, an expert at the NICD. Scientists from the same institute have said initial data suggests that Omicron may provoke less severe illness than previous variants although that may be skewed by the fact that many of the first Omicron cases have been identified in younger iniduals or detected in very recently screened travellers. In mid-November South Africa was reporting about 300 Covid cases a day. On Wednesday, it reported 8,561 new cases, up from 4,373 the day before and 2,273 on Monday. Read the full story here:  The Colorado department of public health and environment reported that the patient had been vaccinated, had mild symptoms and was recovering at home, KKTV reports.  Colorado is the third state in the US to identify an Omicron case, after California on Wednesday and Minnesota earlier today. Health officials said a case had also been found in an adult man who attended an anime convention in New York City in late November. The man, who had been vaccinated, tested positive after returning home to Minnesota and sought Covid testing after showing mild symptoms on 22 November. Officials in New York said they were working to trace those who attended the Anime NYC 2021 convention, held from 19 to 21 November at the city’s Jacob K Javits convention centre. Vaccinations were required for the event. Governor Kathy Hochul said there were no confirmed Omicron cases among New York residents, but mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement that “we should assume” there is community spread of Omicron in the city.The two new cases are two people who boarded in South Africa, passed through Ethiopia, landed in Guarulhos, and finally arrived in Brasilia. One inidual has mild symptoms of the disease and the other is asymptomatic. There are still eight investigations in progress.Employees were previously told they would be expected in offices on 10 January in a new hybrid work format, with offices in different countries and locations to determine for themselves when to return beyond that date depending on local conditions.

The 19-year-old woman, who was asymptomatic and had been vaccinated, had tested positive for Covid-19 on arrival in Malaysia, via Singapore, and was quarantined for 10 days before being released on 29 November. Five other people who shared a vehicle with her prior to her quarantine all tested negative, Reuters reports.  Authorities, however, have asked the student along with eight close contacts to undergo further testing after her earlier test samples were confirmed to be the new variant.In early March, 1.7 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, dispatched via the Covax mechanism for poorer countries, arrived in the DRC. But authorities postponed the start of vaccinations after several European countries suspended vaccination campaigns with AstraZeneca over fears that it caused rare but serious blood clotting. Rumours flooded social media, claiming that vaccination made people sterile or that Africans were to be used as “guinea pigs” or even killed. The coronavirus was presented as a “white man’s disease” brought into the DRC by travellers. President Felix Tshisekedi made his suspicions of the AstraZeneca jab widely known. “I think I was right not to be vaccinated ... I had my doubts,” he said, adding that he preferred to wait for other vaccines before taking the plunge. Many Congolese say they have not been vaccinated “yet” or are waiting to see, but among others, scepticism runs deep. “They say that vaccines in Europe are not the same as here,” Emmanuel, a 62-year-old police officer, told AFP by way of explanation. “In my opinion, Covid does not exist,” Fabrice, a 21-year-old architecture student, said, adding he did not even know anyone who has caught it. A total of 9,216 new cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, according to a ministry of health update.  The nation’s active caseload currently stands at 99,976 - the lowest since March 2020.The restriction applies to travellers who have been to South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe or Malawi within a two-week period, Panama’s government said in a statement, Reuters reports. Panamanians and residents of the country who are vaccinated must present a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours of arriving in the country, while those who are not inoculated must place themselves in “preventative quarantine,” the government said.More than 150 cases have been recorded in the city of Manzhouli since 28 November, centred around the freight hub. On Tuesday it reported another 53 locally transmitted cases. On Wednesday the city, in the northern China region of Inner Mongolia, said it would halt cargo loading and unloading and customs transportation and clearance at the highway port of entry.  The city had already closed several cargo yards as a result of the cases, and flights, trains, coaches, taxis and city buses have been suspended. Schools were moved online, and hospitals have been limited to emergency care only. Authorities had also imposed controls on city exits, temporarily closed markets and cultural, sports, leisure and entertainment establishments, and put limits on weddings, religious gatherings, and restaurants. The more than 300,000 people who live in the city were ordered to get tested. The ban, which goes into effect at midnight on Friday, covers people who have been in or transiting through South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Malawi and Hong Kong. Travellers who have been to these countries in the past three weeks will also not be allowed to enter Nepal, and all other international visitors already in transit must spend seven days at their own cost in hotel quarantine, the government said in a statement. “Nepali nationals are advised against non-essential foreign travel for fear of the new variant,” Home Ministry spokesman Phanindra Pokharel told Reuters. The daily rise brings the cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases in the country to more than six million with 6,051,560 cases. The Los Angeles County public health department says a full vaccinated county resident is self-isolating after apparently contracting the infection during a trip to South Africa last month. The person’s symptoms are improving without medical care and some people who were in close contact with the traveller have tested negative for the virus and don’t have any symptoms, the department said in a press release. The traffic light system, announced by prime minister Jacinda Ardern in late November, ends lockdowns in favour of restrictions on the unvaccinated. For the vaccinated, much of life opened up at midnight on Thursday: they could once again invite family and friends into their homes, plan a trip to the gym, drink in a bar, sit in a cafe and drink an espresso.  Our New Zealand reporter, Tess McClure, has the full story here. Qin told a dinner hosted by the US-China Business Council that Beijing would also work to make Covid-19 testing more convenient and would allow executives to work during quarantine, Reuters reports. He repeated Beijing’s call for Washington to abolish additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the administration of former President Donald Trump. Thailand has reported another 4,912 cases of Covid-19 and 33 deaths over the past 24 hours. South Korea reports another 4,944 cases of Covid-19 and 34 deaths. The figures are a drop on Thursday’s record of more than 5,200 daily infections as concern grows over the sharp rise in patients with severe symptoms.Another 11,535 new cases and 44 deaths have been reported. This is a significant jump from Wednesday’s 8,561 new cases, up from 4,373 the day before and 2,273 on Monday. The Omicron variant has fuelled a “worrying” surge in coronavirus cases in the country and is rapidly becoming the dominant strain, local health officials have said. Omicron appears to be reinfecting people at three times the rate of previous strains, experts in South Africa previously said. Hawaii Epidemiologist Dr Sarah Kemble said Thursday that the adult had been infected with Covid-19 a year ago, isn’t currently hospitalised and had “mild-to-moderate” symptoms including headache, body aches and cough. She wouldn’t identify the patient other to say the person lives on the island of Oahu.Of the new infections, 80 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 53 a day earlier. China reported 24 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, compared with 13 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. As of 2 December, mainland China had 98,993 confirmed cases.In addition to the conventioneer, health officials said tests showed five other people recently infected with Covid-19 had the variant, the Associated Press reports.  They included a person in the city’s Long Island suburbs who had recently travelled to South Africa, residents of Brooklyn and Queens and another case possibly linked to travel. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the geographic spread of the positive tests suggested the variant was undergoing “community spread” in the city, and wasn’t linked to any one event. Officials in the city of 8.8 million said they expected it would be only a matter of time before the new variant was reported in the city. “We should assume there is community spread of the variant in our city,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. As comfort over air travel returns, it’s inevitable that new variants like Omicron will spread from country to country and state to state, said professor Danielle Ompad, an epidemiologist at New York University’s School of Global Public Health. “We shouldn’t panic, but we should be concerned,” she said. I’ll be giving you a rundown of the latest coronavirus updates as they happen. Let’s start off with the news that multiple cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have been detected in New York, health officials said late Thursday, including a man who attended an anime convention in Manhattan in late November and tested positive for the variant when he returned home to Minnesota. Health officials also said tests showed five other people recently infected with Covid-19 had the variant in the city’s Long Island suburbs as well as Brooklyn and Queens, the Associated Press reports.  Governor Kathy Hochul said the cases were “no cause for alarm” as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the geographic spread of the positive tests suggested the variant was undergoing “community spread” in the city.

The EPA report emphasises a necessity ‘to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling’. File photograph Moya NolanThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has highlighted “worrying trends” on Irish waste, with volumes increasing at the same time as a marked decline in recycling and an overreliance on incineration.Its latest report on volumes, issued on Friday, confirms key waste streams are trending in the wrong direction, coinciding with sustained economic growth. This will make it difficult to adhere to demanding European Union requirements over the coming decade, warns the EPA.Systemic change is needed across all economic sectors “to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling”, it adds.The share of municipal waste sent for incineration – with some energy generation – is up from 4 per cent in 2009 to 46 per cent in 2019, the EPA confirms.Ireland’s recycling rate for municipal waste fell from 41 per cent in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2019, while the recycling rate for packaging waste has declined from 70 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2019.“The trends show that Ireland is facing a widening gap to meet ambitious new EU recycling targets from 2025 onwards,” warns the national waste statistics summary report for 2019.Waste generation in Ireland increased significantly in 2019 with municipal waste up by 6 per cent to 3.1 million tonnes, packaging waste increased by 11 per cent to 1.1 million tonnes and hazardous waste rose by 10 per cent to 0.6 million tonnes.Director of the EPA’s office of environmental sustainability Sharon Finegan said: “A circular economy is one that is based on less waste and more reuse of materials these trends show Ireland is going in the wrong direction. Our rising levels of waste are unsustainable and need to stop.“Systemic change is needed across all economic sectors to shift the focus to designing out waste and promoting reuse and recycling.”Over the past decade in Ireland there have been dramatic changes in waste management. Only 15 per cent of municipal waste was landfilled in 2019 compared with 61 per cent a decade earlier. There has been a significant increase in the share of municipal waste sent for incineration with energy recovery over the same period, from 4 per cent in 2009 to 46 per cent in 2019.Ireland’s recycling rates for municipal and packaging waste have been in gradual decline for several years, as efforts to improve recycling have been outstripped by the growth in waste being generated and the amount being sent for energy recovery.Municipal wasteThe share of plastic packaging waste sent for incineration with energy recovery increased from 64 per cent in 2018 to 69 per cent in 2019 2½ times more plastic packaging waste was disposed of in this way than was recycled (221,000 tonnes versus 89,000 tonnes).The recycling rate for municipal waste has fallen from 41 per cent in 2016 to 37 per cent in 2019, while the recycling rate for packaging waste has declined from 70 per cent in 2013 to 62 per cent in 2019. The trends show Ireland is facing a widening gap to meet ambitious new EU recycling targets from 2025 onwards.EPA senior scientist Dr Tara Higgins said Ireland’s declining recycling rates were a significant cause for concern. But she acknowledged “measures needed to increase recycling and close the gap to new EU recycling targets” were introduced recently.These include: allowing soft plastics such as films and wraps into recycling bins continued expansion of brown bin services to households new requirements for all packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2030 and a levy on waste recovery.The EPA estimates Ireland generated 1.1 million tonnes of food waste in 2019 up from 1.05 million tonnes generated in 2018 – food waste is responsible for up to 10 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions.About half of Ireland’s food waste is estimated to come from the processing and manufacturing sector, with the remainder arising from households (23 per cent) and the commercial sector including restaurantsfood service and retaildistribution (32 per cent).

Should highly pathogenic AI be confirmed, these TCZs will be revoked and a three-kilometre protection zone (PZ) and 10-kilometre surveillance zone (SZ) established.”Dr Huey warned flock keepers to urgently take steps to protect their birds.“Given this suspected incursion of notifiable AI, we cannot afford to be complacent.

Photograph Nick BradshawFurther Covid restrictions for the Christmas season, including reduced capacity for pubs and indoor hospitality and limits on the number of households that can mix, are likely to be discussed by Ministers and senior officials today.Ministers were last night awaiting recommendations of new Covid restrictions from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), which met yesterday. There was a wide expectation at all levels of Government that Nphet would propose further restrictions to deal with the current wave of cases and the threat from the new Omicron variant.People may be asked to restrict the number of households they mix with at Christmas, with three households permitted to visit a fourth, while capacity limits on indoor hospitality, as well as a limit on the size of groups in pubs and restaurants, are also likely to be considered by Government. Requiring Covid certs for entry to a wider range of settings is also thought to be among the measures. “There is a mood of resignation around,” said one Cabinet Minister. He said his colleagues were querying the need for further restrictions at this point as cases appeared to have plateaued and begun to fall, a view echoed by another senior Minister. However, several sources said that with the potential for the new variant to spread more quickly, it would be hard for the Government not to follow any new public-health recommendations.Other sources familiar with discussions said there was also likely to be a focus on compliance with the existing regulations, while it is also thought likely that a package of supports for the hospitality industry will be introduced if the proposed restrictions are approved by Government. Sources acknowledged the tensions between Nphet and the Government, particularly in the approach to schools. Dr Cillian De Gascun, a leading member of Nphet, said yesterday he was “hopeful” schools could reopen after Christmas if case numbers had not increased and the Omicron variant was not circulating widely in the community.But the Taoiseach and senior officials have repeatedly stressed in recent days that there is no question of closing schools. Breakthrough infectionsMeanwhile, the Health Service Executive’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, has warned there will “probably” be breakthrough infections among people who receive Covid-19 vaccine booster doses.He was responding to reports this week from Israel that two triple-vaccinated doctors had been infected with the Omicron variant and had shown mild symptoms of the disease.Dr Henry said the HSE had so far found no cases of breakthrough infections among the boosted Irish population but predicted cases were likely as more people received third doses.“The greater number of cases out there in the community, the greater amount of community transmission, the greater the likelihood is that you will see breakthrough infection.”He told the HSE’s weekly Covid-19 briefing the early benefits from boosters were a “cause for hope” as new infections and hospitalisations among older age groups have fallen sharply,The briefing heard case numbers in hospitals were “stabilising” but at “an extremely high level” presenting a “huge risk” to the health service heading into the winter period.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the numbers of people with Covid-19 in hospital and in intensive care units were “still far too high” with Christmas and New Year approaching and that they were having a “highly disproportionate impact” on the health service.“We go into December on high alert,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the life and legacy of charles j haughey with professor gary murphy","story":"Depending on who you ask, Charles J.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe president stood up, put on his green velvet cap, lifted the gavel and brought it down sharply to call us to order. We were sitting in a horseshoe on either side of him, half of us with a red rose in our lapel and the others wearing white ones.He was the most interim of presidents, in office for one night only as neither the outgoing incumbent nor his chosen successor could be there and he confessed right away that he didn’t know what he was doing. He confirmed it a few minutes later by getting the date of the club’s foundation wrong, shrugging amiably when a member draped in a couple of layers of old tweed corrected him.The club has met twice a year for dinner since the 1890s, for most of that time in the same building in Mayfair where about 30 of us were sitting now. It commemorates a single poem written in the 19th\u0026nbspcentury and honours its author while celebrating conviviality, friendship and the view that life is not to be taken too seriously.The format is always the same with the names of all the members and guests printed on the menu, which has a drawing on the front and a poem on the back. The poem is recited by its author, the artist explains the drawing and there are two other speeches, one a learned reflection on the club’s literary subject and the other a vilification of the guests.My guest demanded we meet outside because he was afraid to go in on his own, an anxiety that proved well-founded when he was confronted by an old friend of mine who has become more eccentric over the years.“Are you a spy?” he said.When I boasted that my guest was, in fact, a poet it only deepened my old friend’s suspicion and he gave us both an arch, knowing smile. He sat next to me at dinner while my guest was trapped on the other side of the table with his, a morose figure who announced as they sat down that he had nothing to say.My old friend’s conversation was more promising although it came in fits and starts, stopping abruptly every so often as he stared at the ceiling or jumped up to take a picture of me with his phone. During one of his silences, I asked him about one of the guests on the other side of the room.“The one who looks like Marcel Proust?” he said.It was true. He had the same heavy eyelids, smooth, sallow complexion and soft, drooping moustache and he sat impassively throughout, watching quietly. Before I could find out more, my old friend stood up and announced that he was swapping places with my guest.After our dinner of beef and suet pie washed down with wine that had oesophageal reflux written all over it, the speeches began. The artist was a little sentimental about missing friends during the lockdowns, the poet made no claims for his doggerel and the learned speech was mostly inaudible.The highlightAs always, the vilification of the guests was the highlight as the club secretary used the biographical details we provided to accuse them all of being imposters and fantasists. It was revelatory too, so that I only noticed how improbably broad Marcel Proust’s shoulders were when we were told that he was a professional rugby player.As we laughed and blushed our way through the speeches and the members toasted the guests, the guests toasted the members and we all toasted our honoured poet, I thought about how many gatherings like this were happening all over England on this cold, dark night. Every country has its clubs and associations but nowhere are they invested with so much ceremony and with so much effort put into the most trivial of rituals as in England.Roger Scruton described it as a kind of enchantment that endows objects, customs and institutions with a moral character, so that we respond to them as we respond to one another and to which the English were more than normally alert.“They related more easily to clubs, regiments, schools and teams than to human beings. Or rather, they found human relations more natural, more easy to conduct without embarrassment, when they occurred between people already joined by some shared form of membership,” he wrote.Looking around towards the end of the evening, the timid and the awkward seemed as contented as the charming and the clever and the brilliant chatted easily with the bores. As we were leaving, I saw my old friend standing alone like Charlie Chaplin with his feet splayed and an umbrella over his arm.“Let’s meet again soon,” he said, looking at the floor.“We can talk about, I don’t know, life.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"europes omicron panic has left continent dark place","story":"It may be tempting fate to say it, but Britain is perhaps the best place in Europe to spend this Christmas. Bavaria’s winter markets have closed, France’s bistros won’t let anyone in without a pass sanitaire, Belgium has banned private parties and Ireland’s pubs are all under curfew. But in Britain, the vaccinated and the unvaccinated can walk, work, eat and drink where they like. Unless the omicron variant changes everything, we may well see in the New Year having overcome the virus and upheld the basic values of liberty.Things are rather different in Germany, where hospitals are filling up and the government is planning to lock down the unvaccinated. Olaf Scholz, the incoming chancellor, favours making vaccinations compulsory and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, is suggesting that all 27 EU members consider doing the same. Freedom should not mean freedom to infect others, runs the fairly clear argument. So it’s time for governments to take back control.This would be an easier argument if science backed it up, but studies so far make this a hard case to defend. Vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness but no guarantee against either acquiring the virus or passing it on. This makes it impossible to declare that a restaurant full of jabbed diners is “safe”. The no-jab, no-job argument also comes up against the case of the unjabbed who have had the virus. An Israeli study of 750,000 people showed that natural immunity was far stronger than vaccine-acquired immunity. So, on what grounds can someone with post-recovery immunity be fired?In France, vaccine passports have had some success in narrowing the uptake gap between young and old. But in Scotland they have proved a flop, with vaccination rates rising no faster than those in England after Nicola Sturgeon’s scheme was announced. Anyone proposing to make life harder for the unjabbed also needs to be honest about who they tend to be: ethnic minorities, the poor and the otherwise-marginalised.The unvaccinated that Angela Merkel is now squaring up against, in her final act as chancellor, are far more likely to live in her old East Germany where Alternative for Germany (AfD), the populists, are strongest. One poll found that half of unvaccinated Germans voted AfD in the recent election. This fits a trend. Across Europe, the anti-lockdown cause has tended to be picked up by Eurosceptic populists who find blunt ways of making their objections known. This has complicated the debate, with politicians often seeing the face of their political opponents in the various protests.The arrival of booster jabs makes the idea of compulsion harder still: if top-ups are needed every three to six months, how will this affect vaccine passports? Will people have to receive every top-up for the ongoing right to enjoy their liberty? Otto Schily, a minister in Gerhard Schröder’s government, yesterday pointed out that even Communist China isn’t considering mandatory vaccines. So where, he asked, will Merkel’s idea lead? Will Mr Scholz now yield to the activist lawyers advocating prison sentences for vaccine refuseniks?The politics of all this is just as isive in Italy, now in its 19th consecutive week of anti-restriction protests. Next week, it will bring in a “super green pass” where a negative test is no longer enough. Austria will start issuing fines for the unvaccinated from February, as Greece will do next month (but only for pensioners). Even Sweden, having defied the world for so long by rejecting mask-wearing and lockdowns, has now succumbed to vaccine passports. Britain is starting to look like the new Sweden: keeping calm and carrying on.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has flatly ruled out compulsory vaccination, seeing it as not just illiberal but counterproductive. “If you make the vaccine attractive, people will want it,” says one senior official. “If we start to threaten people, it all changes very quickly.” Right now, Britain has face masks on public transport. And non-binding advice from one minister to go easy on “snogging under the mistletoe”. And, so far, not much else.This shows Javid’s difference in style. Rather than leaping to worst-case hypotheticals, he’s keeping his eye on the data – and they show virus levels still under control. Among pensioners, vaccine uptake is 93 per cent and antibody levels are at 98 per cent: figures unlikely to be pushed much higher by restrictions. The omicron variant could put everything back to square one – and if so, there are no end of emergency buttons to press. But so far, there is no cause for alarm.Javid and others took plenty of political heat in the summer when they ended lockdown. The idea then was to face whatever Covid had in store when the health service was better able to take it – and specifically to be ready for winter. That’s why there is such reluctance to follow the rest of Europe into lockdown now. Why take the hit on the economy and the health service in anticipation of a variant that might not be so bad?Prof Philip Thomas, who predicted the third wave with modelling for Bristol University, envisages Covid steadily petering out over the next few weeks. Omicron has not (yet) changed his mind. Against this come studies – one from South Africa yesterday – saying there’s a decent chance that omicron has “substantial” ability to reinfect. It will be weeks, most likely, until anything is known for sure.Nothing is ever certain with Covid, and bumps (like yesterday’s case spike) are a reminder of how quickly things might change. Inside No 10, there are plenty of people ready to reach for vaccine passports, given half an excuse. But even Sturgeon had to give up on her plan to roll them out when the evidence showed they didn’t work. There are plenty in Government who think ending lockdown in summer did enough to “save Christmas” and don’t want it imperilled now.Last time around, Britain locked down longer and harder than anyone else in Europe. This time, Javid’s instinct is the opposite: not to jump too soon, trust the boosters and see what happens. Quite a gamble. But this time, it’s one the Government is willing to take.More from NewsFriday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Prosecution team in Ghislaine Maxwell\u0026#39s trial opens with series of own goalsAlec Baldwin: \u0026#39If I felt that I was responsible, I might have killed myself\u0026#39BLM urges boycott of white companies for \u0026#39Black Xmas\u0026#39Supermarket chain turns to \u0026#39Orwellian\u0026#39 facial recognition cameras to bag thievesOld Bexley and Sidcup by-election result: Tories hold off Labour challengeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"merkel claimed great unifier leaves great divider","story":"Angela Merkel’s 16 years as Chancellor of Germany ended last night on a nostalgic, even bathetic note, with a torchlit military parade accompanied by a band playing a Communist-era East German pop song. The ceremony, broadcast live to the German nation, marks the end of the Merkel era. This Grosser Zapfenstreich dates back three centuries to Frederick the Great, who imported ceremonies by torchlight from Tsarist Russia. Mrs Merkel might not seem to have much in common with Prussia’s most martial monarch, but she was brought up in Bandenburg, the heartland of “Old Fritz”, and there is something profoundly Prussian about her legacy.It isn’t just her frugality and formality, her sentimentality and ruthlessness, her love of rules and regulations that mark her out as a proper Prussian. In her long reign Mrs Merkel has recast Germany in her own image: happy to carry on pretending that everything is fine, when in reality every major problem is postponed, evaded or brushed under the carpet. As so often in its chequered history, Merkel’s Germany is a nation in denial.The evasions began soon after she took office in 2005. The financial crash hit Europe hard, and soon morphed into a crisis of the euro. Rather than loosen the straightjacket of the single currency, however, the Merkel government forced the weaker EU members to endure austerity policies and crippling unemployment rates in order to keep German exports competitive. Her intransigence reminded smaller EU countries of their suffering under German domination in the distant past. Greece, which was worst hit by austerity, has still neither recovered nor forgiven Mrs Merkel. Most Germans, though, ignore the fact that they remain beneficiaries of an artificially low exchange rate, instead imagining that they are bailing out the rest of Europe.Around the same time, the Fukushima disaster panicked Germany. Mrs Merkel persuaded herself that abandoning nuclear power was a sensible policy, when in reality it forced Germany to rely on filthy “brown coal” (lignite) and Russian gas. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, now awaiting regulatory approval, is a strategic nightmare, giving President Putin more leverage at Ukrainian expense. She could have halted Gasprom’s project at any time in the last 15 years, but she never dared.Such moral cowardice showed in the next crisis, over migration. It began with Mrs Merkel taking a tough line, which she abruptly reversed after appeals from refugee children. Her offer to accept undocumented migrants from Syria was born of a mixture of genuine sympathy and fear of international criticism: Germans could never be seen to put refugees behind barbed wire. But she never expected a million asylum-seekers to arrive, nor that her neighbours would refuse to pick up the pieces. In the end, a temporary solution was found by bribing the Turks to keep them in camps — enabling the autocratic President Erdogan to blackmail the EU. Germans have convinced themselves that her gesture restored their moral authority in reality, it has solved nothing, as the new crisis on Poland’s borders shows.This largely unnecessary migration crisis led directly Brexit, another case where her Prussian obsession with inflexible rules led the EU to lose a key member state — a disaster for which its collective leadership still denies responsibility. David Cameron tried hard to cultivate Mrs Merkel, but she never believed his warnings that the British would vote to leave. This stubborn refusal to face the fact that the EU was rejected by popular vote still persists, fed by a wariness of democracy inherited from the “Red Prussia” of her youth. The fall of the Berlin Wall, her most formative experience, did not teach her to trust the people — rather, the opposite. Mrs Merkel has always prided herself on being tough in her dealings with dictators. She speaks fluent Russian, but this has not deterred Vladimir Putin from trying to intimidate her — exploiting her nervousness of dogs, for example, by allowing his hounds into one of their meetings. While Mrs Merkel has championed human rights and the rule of law, she never dared to stand up to Russian, Chinese or Iranian leaders. Notwithstanding Georgia and Ukraine, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Israel or Syria: where vital German interests are at stake, business is business.With Donald Trump, Mrs Merkel could allow herself more liberties. Yet she neither sought nor deserved the roles of “leader of the free world” or feminist icon which some conferred on her. However unpretentious, she has become a pretender to greatness.Unlike the truly great Prussians, Frederick II and Bismarck, Angela Merkel was a figurehead but never a fighter. The Iron Chancellor saw politics as the art of the possible, yet achieved the impossible. For the Teflon Chancellor to whom we now bid farewell, politics was about promising to move with the times while actually clinging to the past.

That appears to suggest Brits could be offered a fourth dose, given the supply would be more than enough to do so. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the buy-up will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead and future proof the Great British vaccination effort.And the head of Pfizer today said annual vaccinations are likely. Dr Albert Bourla told the BBC : Based on everything I have seen so far, I would say that annual vaccinations... are likely to be needed to maintain a very robust and very high level of protection. The government said the deals include  million extra doses of the Moderna vaccine and  million more Pfizer BioNTech doses. That is top of million Pfizer doses due in the second half of next year, and  million Novavax and . million GSK Sanofi doses expected in . It means the UK government has now secured early access to .million vaccine doses from six firms. The UK has still not completed its pledge to give million doses to poorer nations by mid-, including sub-Saharan Africa where the Omicron iant appeared.  Minister George Freeman defended the buy-up, telling Sky News “it’s a balance and adding: The British public would expect us to make sure we’re providing the supply in the UK. But Prof Andrew Pollard of the Oxford Vaccine Group said: As we approach the moment when  billion doses of COVID- vaccines will have been administered worldwide, it is scandalous that such a small proportion have been administered in low-income countries. Pfizer boss Dr Bourla also backed the idea of vaccinating children aged  to , telling the BBC: Covid in schools is thriving. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it. Boris Johnson has imposed new restrictions to buy time for scientists to establish whether the Omicron iant is able to evade existing vaccines.The strain, which was first detected in South Africa and has spread to the UK and a number of countries, is believed to be more infectious than the dominant Delta iant. Masks are now mandatory again in shops and on public transport, with all international arrivals told to take a PCR test and isolate until they get a negative results. Contacts of Omicron cases will be forced to isolate for  days - regardless of their vaccination status. All eligible adults in the UK will also be offered a booster jab by the end of January to boost immunity levels, the PM has pledged.But Mr Johnsonaposs new target - which also sees the minimum gap from second dose to booster slashed to three months - will force NHS chiefs to signicantly speed up the programme.Roughly . million people have had a second dose so far, while .million have had a booster. This leaves some . million people in need of a booster by the end of January. Mr Javid said: Thanks to the Vaccines Taskforce, we have an excellent track record of securing the vaccines the country needs to keep this virus at bay. “These new deals will future proof the Great British vaccination effort – which has so far delivered more than  million first, second and booster jabs across the UK – and will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead. “This is a national mission and our best weapon to deal with this virus and its iants is to get jabs in arms – so when you are called forward, get the jab and get boosted.” People are being urged to wait until they are contacted to get their booster as the NHS calls in the army and volunteers to speed up the rollout. Previously only the over-s and people with certain health conditions were being offered a third dose - but the rollout has now been expanded to all over-s. The priority list will move down in five-year age bands. NHS England is due to write to vaccination centres to ask them to invite all over-s by December , according to The Times. The Prime Minister, , is expected to get his own booster jab on Thursday. Labour leader Keir Starmer, , is expected to receive his booster jab next week.His spokesman said the party chief has also been using lateral flow tests multiple times a week. The orders come on top of the  million additional Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of next year, and the  million Novavax and . million GSK Sanofi doses expected in .

The Government hasn’t a clue either. In the space of four days we have been told not to socialise, then ordered to take a lateral flow testwe are going a party and then advised to keep any gatherings small. One minister at the Department for Business suggested large firms should not hold Christmas bashes only to be contradicted by another who said they should go ahead. Boris Johnson is now saying we shouldn’t cancel any plans. We have had a blizzard of advice but absolutely no clarity.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Either the Government is incapable of coming to a decision or it is being deliberately opaque because it does not want to be held responsible the consequences. They seem to have forgotten that we are dealing with a deadly virus. Lack of clear guidance is undermining confidence and sowing confusion at a critical moment. It is not just creating resentment, it is hampering our ability to control Covid. Beyond evil During his short le Arthur Labinjo-Hughes suffered unimaginable cruelty. It is unbearable to think of the torture and barbarity this six-year-old endured at the hands of his father and stepmother. The way they treated him was beyond evil. And while they hold ultimate responsibility, it is right that a review has been launched into the role of the social services. One questions that must be examined is whether lockdown was a factor in Arthur’s death. The NSPCC and Childline both reported an increase in calls when schools were closed and restrictions were in force. It is heartbreaking to think how many other children may have suffered during this time. Car blimey... A woman of  has been revealed as Britain’s oldest learner driver.

Heres what the guidance says, and what MPs have added on topBoris Johnson switching on the Christmas lights in Downing Street Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsYet again, you’d be forgiven for being confused about Covid rules. With the Omicron iant on the rise, the government imposed new laws on face masks and travel testing in England. But that then triggered a wave of ‘freelancing’ advice from ministers and a top official that wasn’t government policy. No has been forced to deny the Cabinet are at loggerheads amid the flurry of conflicting comments.Officially, the government’s Covid advice in England is as follows.It’s a legal requirement to wear a face maskin shops, public transport, banks and hair salons. It’s also a legal requirement for all arrivals in the UK to get a Day  PCR test and isolate until it is negative. And it’s a legal requirement to isolate for  daysyou’re a close contact of a suspected Omicron case - evenyou’re vaccinated. However, it’s not a legal requirement to cut down on gatherings or close contact, work from home, or reduce travel. Masks also aren’t a legal requirement in hospitality venues. Guidance - which is voluntary - “strongly recommends” that people wear a mask “in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Guidance also says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test” for Covid in certain situations. These include on days when they’ll be “spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” So with that out the way, what on earth have Tory ministers - and an advisor to the government - been saying  We take you through it.‘Don’t snog under the mistletoe, much’ Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said Brits should refrain from smooching strangers at Christmas. I donapost think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe,” the Work and Pensions Secretary told ITVaposs Robert Peston. Donapost need to do things like that. But I think we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us and thataposs why weaposre working so hard to get the deployment of as many vaccines as possible, and of course continuing to encourage people who havenapost been vaccinated at all yet, to come forward, recognising that weaposre still trying to understand the impact of Omicron.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: Well, not with people you donapost already know! No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. ‘Companies may cancel big Christmas parties’ Science Minister George Freeman turned into Mr Freelance when he appeared to contradict his own boss and No. He said: “For many small businesses, four or five staff working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. “And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’, given the pandemic and given where we are.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.“There is no government guidance to that end.  “It’s right that post Step Four weto the position were people can use their inidual judgement.” Meanwhile Mr Freeman said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash. But his words came weeks after the Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. A Business Department source said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned.‘Maybe take a lateral flow test, I might wear a mask’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid tracked close to the official guidance - but that only went to show how vague it is.He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules, but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a Christmas party. If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think he was very clear about what he was saying. He was setting out that we do have a signicant testing capacity, andpeople wanted further reassurance they could use that.‘Go to nativity plays - but obviously wear a mask’Care Minister Gillian Keegan encouraged parents to attend school events - but added they should “obviously” follow non-mandatory guidance. Asked about nativity plays, she replied: “I think we’ve said go about your plans. “I mean, obviously wear a mask, be cautious, you know, all the things that people usually put in place, to be honest. “I think most people have been sensible all along, but we’re not saying to people cancel your plans and I’m sure it would be lovely to go to a nativity play right now.” AskedChristmas would be “ruined”, Ms Keegan replied: “Hopefully not”.‘Try not socialising when you don’t need to’Dr Jenny Harries is the odd one out in this list as she’s a non-political scientic advisor to the government, not a Tory minister. But the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agencytriggered the whole row earlier this week with her comments. She said working from home could be a “key” element of controlling a possible surge in future - despite No resisting the measure. She also said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. She told the BBC : Weaposve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and Iaposd like to think of it more in a general way.Which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay. So I think being careful, not socialising when we donapost particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs which, of course, people will now be able to have at a three-month interval from their primary course. Boris Johnson directly rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.”‘We’re not in Plan B yet and don’t cancel anything’Lastly we come to Boris Johnson, who despite enacting mask laws has insisted we’re still not in his Plan B for winter. He has insisted people should not cancel anything and only need to follow the guidance. Despite saying “what Jenny’s saying there is right”, he directly rejected her advice. Askedhe agreed with her he said: “The answer is no.” The PM added: “We’re not going to change the overall guidance, we don’t think that’s necessary. We don’t see anything to suggest that we need to go for instance to Plan B, but what we do need to do is take particular precautions against Omicron until we’ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetBBCConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Amid the fall-out of The Mirroraposs exclusive story, she asked whether the Cabinet Secretary had been aware of the gatherings that were taking place. Ms Rayner wanted to knowhe would be conducting an internal investigation into the use of Government property for the parties and the role played by Boris Johnson and his officials. The Labour deputy leader wrote: You will no doubt understand the seriousness of the allegations made. This Government is undermining public health messaging with their actions and we cannot let this go on unchecked. It cannot be that the Prime Minister believes there to be a set of rules for the public and a totally dferent set of rules for himself. Mr Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number  in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. It is alleged that officials knocked back glasses of wine during a yuletide quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. The following day the PM aposcancelledapos Christmas for millions of people across the country.Mr Johnson refused three times to deny that the boozy parties had taken place when pressed at PMQs.  No  has claimed that Covid rules were followed at all times. But a Downing Street insider claimed there were often evening get-togethers while millions of people were observing the strict curbs imposed by the PM. The source said: “It was the only place you could get together and socialise. They happened most Fridays.” The Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group slammed the PM, who faced demands to apologise for what appears to be a clear breach of his own rules. Member Safiah Ngah lost her father Zahari, , to the virus in February. The -year-old said: “Last Christmas is sadly one I will never forget. “One in  people in my borough had Covid- and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. To think that just a few miles away, Boris Johnson was throwing a ‘Christmas party’, with no care for the rules he had set, is sickening.“In September, he looked bereaved families in the eye and told them he had done ‘everything he could to keep their loved ones safe’.

Mince pies baking  Mulled wine simmering  Nope, it’s the stench of utter hypocrisy… yet again. It takes quite something to make Matt Hancock look good – and he still doesn’t, but at least he resigned when caught breaking Covid rules. Boris Johnson instead appears to be adopting the approach of frenemy Dominic Cummings. He and his staff only attended crowded parties during lockdown to test their eyesight, presumably. We all tried to make the best of it, and hark back to Blitz Spirit and the like, but Christmas  was terrible. At best. At worst it was devastating, and tragic, because many were robbed of sharing a loved one’s last ever festive season. That the restrictions were necessary didn’t make them any less painful or easier to endure. The only thing that made the depressing damp squib of a yuletide in any way bearable was the knowledge that we were all in the same boat. So to find out now that a select few REDACT  or  were in fact enjoying Christmas perks like packed parties featuring festive quizzes and enough booze to make a festive quiz seem fun is just too much. Brings a whole new meaning to the term Secret Santa, doesn’t it   Once again, it’s a case of Do As I Say Not As I Do from this hideously corrupt bunch, who do not deny that these parties took place, but insist that “rules were followed.” Something of a contradiction in terms seeing as the rules literally were that these parties could not take place. Just like when the Johnsons were caught having an overnight guest during the peak of lockdown last Christmas, presumably the Prime Minister now considers this matter closed. Remember, he only begs for forgiveness when he loses his place in a speech about Peppa Pig.

Conservative Louie French took more than half the votes in the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election, while only a third of those eligible to vote took part in the contest triggered by the death of Tory MP James Brokenshire in October.The turn-out was %, with , votes cast, down from almost % at the snap general election two years ago, when , votes were cast.The Conservatives expected to retain the constituency despite a bruising few weeks for Boris Johnson’s administration.The contest took place following damaging headlines over allegations of sleaze, claims that lockdown rules were broken in No  and the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus iant.Mr French was the bookmakers’ firm favourite to win the election, with Labour acknowledging that they did not expect an upset.  In his acceptance speech shortly after am on Friday, the new MP said: “I’m incredibly proud of the campaign my team and I have run based on local issues that matter to the people who live here. “And tonight, those people send a clear message: they want an MP who will work with the Government to deliver on their priorities. “My focus will now be delivering on those promises that I made during the campaign – get our fair share of London’s police officers, securing more investment for local schools and hospitals, protecting our precious green spaces.” He promised voters he would “work tirelessly to repay the trust that you’ve placed in me and I will not let you down”. Mr French, a local councillor, said he was the first home-grown MP for the seat. “This is the greatest honour of my le. And I hope it inspires people to achieve their own dreams.  Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: “We’re pleased with the result tonight.“This is a Conservative stronghold, somewhere that had a , majority at the last general election and what we’ve seen tonight is that majority being slashed. There’s been a % swing over to Labour this evening.“We’ve been knocking on doors for weeks here and finding many, many Conservative voters that have said actually I’m not going to vote for them this time, I’m going to vote for Labour. “I think it’s clear that we’re winning back the trust of people and it’s a remarkable result for us in a Tory stronghold.” Restricting the Conservatives to less than % of the vote would be “great”, a Labour source said before the result was announced. A party official dismissed the suggestion from Conservative deputy chair Justin Tomlinson that Labour would have to run the Tories “very, very close”it was serious about being an alternative government.  They said: “No Conservative candidate has every got below % in this seat. If we can get them down to %, that will be great.” Mr French’s share of more than % of the vote is “almost unheard of”, the Conservative deputy chairman has said. Justin Tomlinson said: “We’re absolutely thrilled. For a Government to get over % of the vote in a parliamentary by-election is almost unheard of, and with a majority of over %. “A fantastic local candidate, positive campaign, focused on the tangible dference we’re making to people’s lives, having navigated the unprecedented challenges of Covid.” He added that the result was an “absolute disaster” for the Labour Party, saying: “They do not look like a Government in waiting.” Reform leader Richard Tice came in third, claiming his party was now “on the upward march”. A string of senior Tories, including the Prime Minister, have visited the constituency during the by-election campaign, with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps among the MPs bolstering the effort to get out the vote on Thursday. But a turnout of just % suggests the by-election contest has failed to excite the public in the constituency. Labour also had a high-profile on the streets of Old Bexley and Sidcup, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and her sister and shadow solicitor general Ellie among those knocking on doors on polling day on behalf of candidate Daniel Francis. Former Cabinet minister Mr Brokenshire, who had represented the constituency since , was diagnosed with early stage lung cancer in . He held the seat in  with a large majority of , votes. A defeat in the by-election would have been a major blow for Mr Johnson, who has suffered a hit in the polls following weeks of sleaze allegations and political blunders. The constituency has always had a Conservative MP since it was created in . Former Tory Prime Minister Ted Heath held the seat - and its predecessor, Bexley - for  years.The last time Labour won in the constituency was in a  by-election. The seat is in the outer-London boroughs where the Tories and Liberal Democrats are traditionally successful. However Labour would expect to face criticismit failed to cut the Conservative majority, on what is expected to be a low turnout. Tributes poured in from across politics to Mr Brokenshire on his death in October at just -years-old. The popular MP was hailed by many for his kindness and decency. He was first diagnosed with cancer in  and resigned as Northern Ireland Secretary to have lung surgery. He ed to Parliament only five weeks later.Mr Brokenshire was made Housing Secretary from April  to July , and he was named as Security Minister in  by Boris Johnson. He took a leave of absence in January  to prepare for another operation, and resigned in July after struggling with his recovery. Mr Brokenshire, who had never smoked, announced in August that the cancer had progressed and he was starting a new line of treatment. Announcing his death in October, his family said in a statement: It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of James Brokenshire MP at the age of . James died peacefully at Darent Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside. He had been in hospital since Sunday after his condition rapidly deteriorated. James was not only a brilliant Government minister as both Security and Immigration Minister at the Home Office and Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry for Housing, Communities  Local Government, but a dedicated constituency MP, first for Hornchurch from  to , and then for Old Bexley  Sidcup for the past  years. But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many.

Sajid Javid said it was not up to the Government to decide who people can kiss amid growing confusion over Covid guidance this Christmas.New restrictions have been brought in to tackle the Omicron iant, including mandatory masks in shops and on public transport, and PCR tests for all arrivals from abroad.But ministers have sowed confusion by saying wildly dferent things about the guidance - which is voluntary rather than a legal requirement - on things like social contact.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told Brits that snogging under the mistletoe should be avoided with people you donapost already know on Wednesday night. But Mr Javid disagreed, telling ITV News today itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, when asked about how people should behave over the Christmas period.He said: People can snog who they wish. Iaposll certainly be kissing my we under the mistletoe, itaposs a Javid family tradition and itaposs got nothing to do with the government who you kiss, or anything like that. Thereaposs guidance already out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves. He did not expand on what he meant by being cautious. Labour leader Keir Starmer also said he didnapost think it was for the Government to dictate who people can kiss or not kiss.I was quite surprised to see that suggestion come out of Government, he told ITV. I think it just demonstrates how they are at sixes and ninesthataposs what they are now discussing. No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. Earlier this week, top official Dr Jenny Harries enraged Tory backbenchers by saying people should reduce their social contacts and avoid socialising when we donapost particularly need to.  Boris Johnson later contradicted her and said events did not need to be cancelled.But then Tory Minister George Freeman muddied the waters by appearing to suggest people should not have big Christmas parties.He told the BBC : Inidual businesses, in the end, have to make judgments on what is appropriate internally.“It slightly depends on the nature of the business. “For many small businesses, four or five staff, who are working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isnapost a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide, this year, is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are  Mr Freeman also told Times Radio: I can tell you the Department of Business, we wonapost be having a big Christmas party this year. Nobody would expect us to. Later on Thursday, Mr Johnson again insisted that people did not need to cancel their festive plans.  Speaking to broadcasters after having his booster jab in London, the PM said: I want to repeat the guidance is there and Iaposm very, very keen that people understand this, we donapost want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things, to start... you talk about kids in nativity plays and that kind of thing. I donapost think thereaposs any need to stop that at all.I think weaposre taking a balanced and proportionate approach to the risk, but I want and I believe that Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year.Boss of pub group Youngaposs Patrick Dardis said some Christmas parties had already been cancelled amid concerns over the Omicron iant.He said: I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent.

Boris Johnson insisted they should go ahead before a business minister urged them to be scrapped. One pub boss said: “It’s terribly confusing.”With Christmas approaching, families and ­festive revellers are desperate to know what they can or cannot do as the Omicron iant threat grows.But the public were left none the wiser tonight after a stream of mixed messages poured out of Downing Street, from advice on parties to kissing under mistletoe. And the muddled advice caused further outrage among a public already furious at No for holding parties last year during lockdown.  Amid fears get-togethers could spark a surge of the latest Covid iant, Boris Johnson insisted no one should cancel yuletide bashes. But hours earlier, Business Minister George Freeman sug­­gested that larger firms should scrap Christmas parties. The confusion grew further today as Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey warned “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with strangers. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said tonight: “People can snog who they wish.  “It’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss. There’s guidance out there, just be cautious and enjoy yourselves.” Mr Johnson, who today had his booster jab at St Thomas’ Hospital in South London, insisted “we want people to continue as they are”. He added: “People should follow the g­uidance that we’ve set out and people shouldn’t be cancelling things, and there’s no need for that at all.” But Mr Freeman cast doubt on works parties. He said: “Inidual businesses must make judgments on what is appropriate ­internally. It depends on the nature of the ­business. “For small businesses, four or five staff, who work together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people in from around the world to a big party, and they may decide is that sensible given the pandemic and given where we are ”  Adding to the lack of clarity, Mr Freeman insisted his Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash – just weeks after Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. He added: “Nobody would expect us to. My parliamentary team, I think we’ve agreed, ­probably given the new iant, we’ll get together on Zoom and toast each other.” Mr Kwarteng had said on October : “We’ve got some arrangements in place, and I look forward to having a Christmas party as usual.” A Business Department source today said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned. It is understood Mr Kwarteng’s bash is still going ahead. The boss of pub group Young’s revealed some parties had already been cancelled due to the confusion. Patrick Dardis said: “I think the messaging has been terribly confusing and inconsistent. “One moment we’re told to avoid socialising and an hour later you have Sajid Javid saying the opposite. “I think the messaging started as a complete ­overreaction and, unsurprisingly, it has concerned some people.” Royal College of Nursing Council chairwoman Carol Popplestone said the “mixed messages” from ministers over Christmas plans could create “even more worry and confusion”. Shadow Business Secretary­ ­Jonathan Reynolds urged revellers to take Covid tests before parties. But he added: “I don’t want to see people cancelling parties now. “People need to live their lives and have some fun but also it has a huge impact on things like the hospitality industry.” A further seven cases of Omicron were confirmed today in England and three in Scotland, the UK Health Security Agency said. It brings the total to . Up  people are believed to have been infected with the iant after a festive party in Norway, the world’s largest outbreak so far. The mixed messages Kissing under the mistletoe Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said: “I don’t think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: “Well, not with people you don’t already know.” But Health Secretary Sajid Javid declared that people can “snog who they wish” this festive season.  Big Xmas parties Minister George Freeman appeared to be freelancing when he suggested that big firms could cancel their festive bashes. He said: “Some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’” But No  said: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.” Socialising Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, said “not socialising when we don’t particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. But Boris Johnson rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel events.”  Testing Mr Javid tracked close to the official guidance on tests but that only went to show how vague it is. He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a party. “If you are invited to a Christmas party, there’s quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. “Go to the party but just be cautious.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas partyPoliticsCoronavirusTory GovernmentCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

According to National World, MBU Capital Group is a London-based financial firm which invests in national resources, education, cannabis CBD and real estate. He took the new job on  November , and according to the register, expects to work for eight hours a month - which amounts to £ an hour.  Mr McPartland, shortly before his election in , promised: “If I became Stevenageaposs MP, I would treat it as a full-time job.” Boris Johnson has promised an overhaul of the rules governing MPs outside earnings - banning MPs from “exploiting their positions” by working as paid consultants. But Labour have argued his plans don’t go far enough, and pledged to ban all second jobs for MPs, with just a few exemptions.It emerged last night that a string of Tory MPs had given up their second jobs in the wake of the scandal. The latest register of members interests shows former chief whip Julian Smith has given up paid roles worth more than £, a year. They include Hygen Energy - a green fuel firm founded by Jo Bamford, the son of JCB mogul and major Tory donor Sir Anthony Bamford - which paid him up to £, a year as an “external adviser advising on business development”. Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith’s register has been updated to show he is no longer a member of the advisory board of healthcare tech firm Tunstall. And Winchester MP Steve Brine’s record has been updated to say he has stepped back as a “strategic adviser” to Sigma pharmaceuticals.

The code phrase is part of the Ask Angela campaign aimed at helping people who feel unsafe, vulnerable or threatened in bars, clubs and other night time venues, Liverpool Echo reports. Anyone who feels this way, can approach bar or security staff using the special code word Angela, which indicates to staff that they require help or support.This might be in the form of calling them a taxi, reuniting them with a friend or calling security and or the police. Adam Potter has been asked the question several times since he started his job as doorman in Liverpool city centre five months ago. The -year-old said every night at work he is approached by women who ask him to keep an eye on men who are making them feel uncomfortable on the dancefloor. And when Adam has been asked by women is Angela in tonight , he says he has stepped in to help.  Adam told the Liverpool Echo: They basically say aposcan you keep an eye on this guy heaposs making me feel uncomfortable apos I probably get that at least once a night, possibly three or four times a night - thataposs just girls who come up to me. They might say aposheaposs tapped me on the bottomapos, in which case he gets thrown out. Any touching inappropriately they get thrown out immediately. Adam has spoken out in the hope of raising awareness of the Ask Angela campaign and encouraging other bar staff to learn about the initiative. It comes after a post was shared widely on social media about the importance of the campaign in keeping people safe on nights out. Adam said: What happens is,a girl comes up to you and says aposIs Angela in tonight apos you know exactly what she means. What you then do is say aposyes apossheaposs in tonight just come with me.apos You take her behind the bar into the staff area and phone for a taxi. In more extreme cases, bar staff might have to call the police or security. Adam said: I went into this job basically just to help people and I do my very best but when I hear about girls constantly being harassed and not being as safe as they used to be going out it makes me feel upset.

Cordelle Scotland, , had to take time off following an operation to treat her endometriosis and was told by her boss to try and swap her shts. Cordelle, who worked at Heathrow Airport as a customer services representative, complained after failing her probationary period and was told she had been sacked as she had been late to work several times. A tribunal ruled the airline treated her unfavourably by criticising Cordelle for not swapping shts. The airline was ordered she be paid £, compensation for injury to her feelings.  Cordelle suffered from fibroids and endometriosis, which causes excessive bleeding, a hearing was told. Having worked for BA for eight months and had her probationary period extended due to concern over absences and lateness, she told bosses she needed to undergo surgery for the condition. The tribunal heard Cordelle sent an email in November  explaining: I am due for hospital admission on th December for an abdominal myomectomy due to my fibroids and endometriosis reaching the stage of disability which in turn affects my work and le in general greatly.To put it into perspective, my uterus is the same size as a five and a half month pregnancy due to the tumours.The recovery period is about  weeks however I have concerns as to how this may affect my probation. I need to have this surgery on this date as I have been having treatment for the last three months to help shrink the fibroids before surgery and it is not recommended for me to continue the treatment any longer than three months as it has induced me into menopause which can trigger osteoporosis. My third and last treatment will be on the th November. As a result, she was signed off by her GP for two weeks from December . When her probationary period ended in February , Cordelle was told her employment would be terminated as your attendance level is unacceptable and you have been late to work on  separate occasions between March  and February . In an email, Heathrow Services Manager Nicola Drinkwater added: I have taken into account that you had a planned medical procedure on the th December , which you have been recovering from and signed off work by your GP between th December  - nd February .  However the seasonal roster you were working offers vast amounts of flexibility to swap shts and work on available rest days prior or post your procedure. She also cited a further three occasions of lateness which came after a review meeting in October  that extended Cordelleaposs probationary period due to concerns regarding your attendance and performance. Cordelle then emailed CEO Alex Cruz and Tom Stevens, BAaposs Head of Worldwide Airports, and said she made all attempts to ensure my surgery would not interfere with my employment. She added: For Nikki to then make the statement that I should have sorted my recovery time off with sht swaps and leave is completely unfair and discriminatory. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.My surgery was gynaecological for endometriosisand uterine fibroids . Why should I be expected to have covered recovery time from major surgery with leave and sht swap. Ms Drinkwater told the tribunal Cordelle was sacked for the high number of times she was late and that it was not because of her sickness absence nor the need to be on restricted duties following herto work. Cordelleaposs claims for wrongful dismissal, direct discrimination because of race and or sex and or disability were dismissed by the tribunal. It also ruled that BA failed to make reasonable adjustments for her disability. The tribunal further ruled that BA had treated her unfavourably under the Equality Act by considering her absence for the operation when terminating her contract and in criticising her for not swapping shts. In his ruling, Employment Judge Oliver Hyams stated: Ms Drinkwater plainly did take into account in making her decision the fact that [Miss Scotland] had had some absences from work on account of sickness which was the result of having endometriosis, which [BA] accepted was a disability. Ms Drinkwater did that by criticising [Miss Scotland] for not swapping shts with the result that she did not, as far as Ms Drinkwater was concerned, exhibit what Ms Drinkwater would have regarded as a commendable spirit. That treatment of [Miss Scotland], ie that criticism, was made only as a result of her being unable to work because of the surgery which had been required to mitigate the effects of her disability. The tribunal said Cordelle would have been sacked anyway because of her lateness but awarded her compensation for injury to feelings.

With everything  he’s got to contend with Riley also suffers from anxiety and the whole experience has helped a lot with that. “Even now when he’s struggling with his illness or feelings of anxiety he’ll reflect back on the day his dream came true to take his mind off the problems of the here and now. “We couldn’t have asked for a more amazing experience.” Riley’s dream day came about with the help of Make-A-Wish UK, this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal charity, an organisation mum-of-two Rachel, , says has offered a ray of hope to the family during some of their most dficult times.“To have time away from what can feel like quite traumatic experiences makes a huge dference,” she says. Riley, now seven, was born prematurely at  weeks in September  weighing lbs oz. “Nothing was picked up during my pregnancy but once I was in labour Riley went into foetal distress and was delivered by emergency C-section,” recalls Rachel, from Newcastle.“Virtually as soon as he was born his journey with one surgery after another began. He had his first operation at just a few hours old.” Riley was diagnosed with TOF OA, two rare conditions that meant he was born with a gap in his oesophagus. Surgery quickly after delivery meant mum Rachel and dad David, , couldn’t kiss him for the first two days of his le. It was four days before they had their first cuddle.  “It was terrying from the beginning,” recalls Rachel. “Even though he had surgery straight away, it was weeks before the gap in his oesophagus was repaired and all that time he was in intensive care.” Riley was allowed home aged seven months old. By then the tot had also been diagnosed with a range of other health problems, including hemivertebra, a congenital condition which means parts of his spine are not properly developed. He also has dextrocardia which means his heart is slightly to the left of where it should be and he has suffered from respiratory illnesses over the years.  “He’s had a tough time,” says Rachel. “But he’s such a lovely boy.” The family’s challenges don’t stop there however, with Riley’s little sister Ruby-Leigh, five, also born with TOF OA. Both youngsters were even hospitalised at the same time. “Nothing was flagged during the pregnancy with Ruby-Leigh either,” says Rachel. “Over the years she’s had multiple surgeries on her oesophagus too. “They both go to mainstream school but it’s dficult, and particularly at this time of year. Very often one of both of them will end up with a respiratory illness as they have tracheomalacia, or a floppy airway, so even a common cold can end up with a chest infection that could lead to pneumonia.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Which is why the experience provided for Riley by Make-A-Wish in January  made such an impact. “I can’t put into words just what help they’ve given us,” says Rachel, who along with partner David is a full-time carer for her children. “Even now we talk about meeting Tim. Make-A-Wish gave us tickets to see him on stage in October and he gave Riley a shout-out. We can’t thank Tim and the charity enough.” Online: www.make-a-wish.org.uk mirror Text: To donate £ text the word LIGHT to .

The six-year-old was living with his paternal grandparents, who “loved and cherished him”, when the pandemic hit. But his dad Thomas Hughes decided to move in with girlfriend Emma Tustin when the country was plunged into lockdown.Today his evil stepmum convicted of murdering the defenceless child after a horric campaign of abuse, while his dad was found guilty of manslaughter.Det Insp Laura Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said it “was the worst decision that could have been made”. “If only Hughes had left Arthur with his grandparents who absolutely doted on him, loved him and cherished him,” she told the Mirror. “The manipulation and the toxic relationship between Tustin and Hughes meant the family were cut out of Arthur’s le and didnapost play a part. “The lockdown meant professionals didn’t have the opportunity to monitor him in the same way they would do with children normally. “I do think that lockdown contributed. “The professionals who would ordinarily have been involved in Arthur’s le, such as teachers, weren’t having that contact with him and spotting changes in his behaviour or bruises on his body. “Tustin and Hughes cut off family members so Arthur was no longer seeing or speaking to him. “And when social workers went out to Tustin’s home there was an absolute manipulation of them by the defendants. “It was the only day when Arthur was allowed to play in the garden and he presented very dferently as a result. “When the professionals did speak to him they weren’t picking up on the signs they would have donehe had been segregated in a hallway. “Tustin and Hughes pulled the wood over the eyes of the professionals. They didn’t want children’s services involved.” Specialist grief counsellors were drafted in to help police left traumatised by Arthur’s death.  Veteran detectives were left in tears as they watched CCTV footage of the helpless youngster alone in his family home. They also discovered harrowing evidence that Arthur had been sadistically poisoned with salt by his dad and step-mum. DI Harrison described it as the “most traumatic” case she had ever investigated. She compared his death to the murder of Daniel Pelka, the tragic four-year-old boy killed by his mum and step-dad in . In both cases the children were deliberately poisoned with salt to increase the suffering before their deaths. “I knew when we started it was a horric case, but there have been moments that have just completely got me,” she said.  “Everyone involved has found it really haunting having to witness and experience the evil and horric torture that Arthur was subjected to. “There are real similarities with Daniel Pelka, definitely in terms of salt poisoning. “I’d not heard of it before in child cruelty cases and it’s been really hard to comprehend. But it is a haunting parallel. “A physical assault is one thing - but it’s very devious and manipulative to dose a child up with salt. It’s another level of evil. “It could only have been done as another way to control Arthur - an extra punishment. “We think maybe they did it to make him more thirsty but we don’t know because they’ve never given us an explanation. “It’s been really dficult for the officers who have to sit for hours watching CCTV footage of Arthur being isolated.  “I arranged for a trauma counsellor to come in to explain the emotions people might be experiencing and to teach coping mechanisms they could put in place. “They have been able to independently see the counsellor without the rest of the team knowing. “We don’t ordinarily get faced with CCTV like this. “The footage really got to the heart of what Arthur was being subjected to and thataposs why it’s been so hard-hitting and dferent to similar cases. “When you add in the  recordings of Arthur in distress and the brutal text messages, it sets it apart from the Pelka and Baby P cases. “We’ve been reliant on medical expert opinion and it’s been crucial. “But the actual emotional element of this case has been proved by that CCTV or hearing audio clips where he is calling out for family members, calling out for food or water, and that nobody loves him. “We all know children in our lives. You just cannot comprehend anybody being able to neglect a child over such a sustained period of time. “It was not a sudden loss of control, it was a well thought-out campaign of abuse, both physically and psychologically, towards Arthur.” DI Harrison said it was “hard to comprehend” how Hughes and Tustin tried to blame Arthur for his fatal injuries. She said: “They’ve blamed each other and they’ve blamed Arthur as well. “How can a six-year-old boy be responsible for what happened  We know he couldn’t have inflicted his fatal injuries himself. “They are both equally responsible. Although Tustin killed Arthur, Hughes encouraged the killing by actions.” The sheer cruelty of the couple was played out in the courtroom over two months. Texts between them showed their feelings towards the little boy, whose mother was previously jailed for the manslaughter of her boyfriend. In brutal messages, Hughes told Tustin to aposjust endapos Arthur and also apostake his jaw offapos and aposgagapos him. He also threatened to apostake his neck offapos and aposdash my food off his headapos. The day before the child died, his dad texted about paying someone to aposdig Arthuraposs graveapos. Tustin was equally vile, the court was told. In one message she said aposf****** launch this lying little f***apos and in another she warned she was aposgoing to chin this little c***apos.

The children are currently not in school due to concerns over covid and Toby’s type  diabetes condition.\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _RGP_MDM_Morris_.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" The Morris family in Somerset - Charlie Morris with children Finley,  , Toby, and Phoebe,  at their home in Whitchurch, Bristol Image: Rowan Grfiths   Daily MirrorByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsSarah Brooks has chronic ­rheumatoid arthritis. Like many people on immunosuppressant drugs, she is double-vaccinated but hasn’t developed any ­antibodies to Covid-. Her four-year-old daughter, Ella, has a rare type of epilepsy that can be ­triggered by a virus or a fever. With Covid rates rising, and the new Omicron iant gaining ground, Mrs Brooks has taken the decision to home school her three children. But – under current government rules – now faces being fined. “We were invited for a meeting with the attendance officer and were told we face fines and or prosecution,” says Mrs Brooks . “On the same day we got a letter saying that the school itself was at the centre of a Covid outbreak. It’s bonkers.” The family have now got in touch with the Good Law Project, who have sent a pre-action letter to the local council challenging the decision to enforce attendance. Getting “back to normal” has left millions of clinically vulnerable people behind. At one time .million were official “shielders”. One in four of them has never stopped according to ONS figures. Now they are just people who can’t go out, but have no extra support. Last week, the number of pupils absent from school in England because of Covid rose by about %. Some , state-school pupils were absent with confirmed or suspected cases on November . Rather than recognising the dilemma faced by vulnerable families, the Secretary of State for Education, Nadhim Zahawi, has doubled down on the Government’s position with a letter to school leaders about “maximising” school attendance. “We are at a crucial point in the pandemic and must collectively act now to ensure lower levels of attendance do not become the accepted norm,” the letter says. “I hope you agree on the urgency.” For the Morris family in Somerset, the letter was devastating. Toby Morris, , has had Type  diabetes since he was a baby. He is a brittle diabetic who needs round-the-clock monitoring. The Morris’s are having to homeschool his sister, Phoebe, seven, and brother Finlay, , because of the risk of them catching the virus at school. Finlay, who himself has asthma, shares a bunkbed with Toby. And their mum, Abi, , has an immune condition. “Because the Government is saying no one has to shield and children should attend as normal, we’re stuck in this nightmare,” their dad Charlie,, explains. “The bubbles, isolating, all the things schools were doing to keep children safe, it’s all gone out of the window. “There are thousands of families like ours put in a position where schools are saying they can’t authorise any absence because it’s meant to now be attendance as normal – but because there are vulnerable people in our family that isn’t safe for us. “School is important – I’m a former teacher. But an education is no goodyou’re dead or suffering a chronic illness as a result of a nasty infection. Our son’s already suffered enough living with a le-long, le-limiting condition.” The family is also being supported by the Good Law Project after claiming their local MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to reply to them. This week, the Government ­introduced masks into communal areas in schools, but stopped short of further mitigations like increasing ventilation, classroom bubbles, masks in classrooms and further access to vaccinations for children. Many Year  children won’t turn  until long after winter. Even then, the vaccination programme for children is grindingly slow. Nadhim Zahawi recently met with Miriam Cates, a Tory MP and education committee member who believes “Covid isn’t a risk to children”. Andrew Lewer MP tweeted “Miriam Cates MP  I met with @nadhimzahawi about face masks in schools  our aspiration to phase them out.” Cates is known for her ­opposition to masks because “showing our faces is part of being human”. She’s also called for an end to regular testing of schoolchildren without symptoms, and says there’s “no rush” for vaccines in schools.For Ella Brooks, at home in the Midlands, catching Covid could be a death sentence. Her rare form of epilepsy means she suffers intense seizures particularly when she has a fever. These can start in her sleep and cause her to stop breathing. “Once again we are behind Wales and Scotland in terms of mitigations being adopted, despite Covid currently running rampant through most schools in England,” her mum says. “The message seems to be ‘attendance at all costs’ – but for us, that cost could be someone’s le.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The best place for young people is in the classroom, it is vital for their education and mental health which is a priority. “All children should be supported to continue to attend school and our guidance to schools about attendance of clinically vulnerable children has been clear throughout. In line with guidance every child aged  and over with specic underlying health conditions has been offered the vaccine.” No one wants ato lockdown home schooling. And yet failing to use masks alongside mitigations like ventilation will likely end in soaring cases. Yesterday, Gwynedd in North Wales, announced ato online learning after a spike in cases. More councils may soon be following suit. “There’s this  argument you’re pro-freedom or pro-lockdown but it’s not that simple,” mum Sarah says. “We don’t want lockdown and we want schools to stay open, but we need them to be made safer and at the moment, for families like ours, they’re not. As parents it’s really stressful.” For her the choice comes down to one thing. “I’ve sat at my daughter’s bedside, watched her struggling. Her condition can be le-threatening and I have to do what I can to prevent that.”Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tory GovernmentJacob Rees-MoggNadhim ZahawiEducationSchoolsMental healthArthritisPoliticsEpilepsyCoronavirusCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The incredibly rare time capsule, that is now worth £,, was the first to leave the production line in September . The show car toured for , miles across the country and was used by the carmakers to advertise their state-of-the-art creation. But after its star-studded first years, the Aston passed into private hands and was put in storage in  where it was left to fall apart. The Vantage was forgotten about until  when it was bought by classic car enthusiast John Cook at an auction.  He spent a whopping £, on an extensive restoration project, ing the car to its factory condition with Fiesta red paintwork and black leather interior. It even includes original copies of magazine reviews, its parts catalogue, instruction book, owner logbook, and test certicates. Charles Ramsey, owner of Classic Connection in Burley, Hants, where the car has ben consigned for sale, said it was the ‘rarest DB in existence’.  He said: “The most impressive thing about this car is that it was the first DB Vantage - and only the third DB - ever to leave the production line. “It was used as a factory demonstration for advertisements and magazine reviews making it very rare to a collector. “The car has been fully restored to its original Fiesta red and all its specications compared to others of its kind which were often changed.  “The history file includes magazine reviews of the car, its owner logbook, instruction book, and factory build sheets. “It’s a blessing this piece of Aston Martin history was discovered after lying dormant and restored to such a remarkable degree”. Mr Cook handed the motor over to Aston Services Dorset, the officially-appointed restorers of vintage Astons, for the restoration project. Only , DBs were made at the Aston Martin factory in Newport Pagnell, Bucks, between  and . The Vantage iant came out in  but only  models were made. The Vantages, which offered a more powerful performance, were even more exclusive. They had a .-litre straight six-cylinder engine that could deliver bhp compared bhp that standard DBs had. Mr Cook, , who is also from Burley, said: “Cars from this period often got to the stage where their value dropped and owners forgot about them which seems to have been the case with this one. “When I bought it, it was in a serious state of disrepair and I gave it to Aston Services Dorset to undergo a £, restoration. “It is such a special car which is so perfect and I want to give it to someone  to enjoy. “I’ve got another project in mind so I needed to clear the decks to get myself ready for it. “I have a real passion for finding old things and bringing them back to how they originally were.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Aston MartinCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Illustrations released by the Genomics UK Consortiumshow that it has a worrying  mutations on its spike protein. By comparison Delta - which tore through the population last winter and has since become the worldaposs dominant strain - has seven. Experts have said Omicron, which was first identied by scientists in South Africa, is the most mutated Covid iant they have yet encountered. This morning a spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency told The Mirror that targeted testing is being carried out for the iant.  This means that not every positive PCR test is screened for the new strain.At the weekend Boris Johnson announced a range of measures aimed at halting Omicronaposs spread, including compulsory PCR testing for all travellers arriving in the UK from abroad.  Contacts of those identied as having the strain are also required to isolate for  days, regardless of whether they have vaccinated. Officials say it is too early to tell how worried we should be about the iant, with Brits urged to show caution.  The strain has been classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation . It is feared that Omicron could prove resistant to vaccines because of the number of mutations in its spike protein. This affects how it responds to antibodies in the immune system, and the way it enters human cells. This week South African Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africaaposs biggest private testing labs, said she had a sinking feeling when she discovered the new strain while genetically testing positive swabs in the country.  She told Reuters: I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process.Early indications show most Omicroncoronavirus cases are mild, the World Health Organisation has said. The official believes there is no evidence to suggest the efficacy of vaccines reduces when battling against the new iant.The organisation, quoted by Reuters, suggested most cases so far examined are not severe. They cautiously added there is still a lot not yet known about the new strain.

However a damp cold home is not only extremely unpleasant, it can also be very bad for your health. Government data has found that in the two years to March , % of all homes in the UK had damp in one room or more while between % and % are thought to have black mould.Damp and mould appear when there is excess moisture in the home, which can be caused by anything from leaking pipes and rising damp on ground floors to leaking ceilings and poor ventilation. How does mould in the house affect my health  Damp in the home can have a array of negative health effects, causing respiratory infections, asthma and allergies. It produces a number of substances that disagree with the human body, including irritants, allergens and, on occasion, toxic substances. If you inhale or touch mould it can lead to allergic reactions including sneezing, a runny nose, skin rashes and red eyes. In more severe cases it can directly lead to asthma attacks. It affects some worse than others with babies, children, the elderly all more sensitive to it.It can also affect people with pre-existing medical conditions that are made worse by its presence. They include people with skin conditions like eczema, respiratory problems like asthma and allergies or those with a weakened immune system like someone undergoing chemotherapy.How to safely get rid of mould from your homeAccording to homeserve, getting rid of mould on walls can be achieved using a number of dferent chemicals including baking soda, white distilled vinegar or % concentration of hydrogen peroxide. They should be applied to the area and left for a time before being scrubbed.It is crucial you find you where the excess moisture is coming from - once you know the source you can begin to take steps to mitigate the effects or solve the issue completely. Getting this done may sometimes need professional help, although smaller amounts can be done yourself. If your home is newly built yet still damp it could be that the water used in its construction, like in wall plaster, is still drying out. How do you stop mould growing in your home  Homeserve suggest a number of top tips for preventing mould from taking hold, they say: Open windows every day to let fresh air in and moisture out Close the door of the room you’re ventilating to keep the rest of the house warm and prevent moisture escaping to other parts Open a window or use an extractor fan when showering, cooking or using a tumble dryer When you’re not showering or cooking, leave internal doors open to let air flow freely around your house Dry any washing outside when possible If you do dry washing inside, open a window and close the door of the room it’s hanging in If you have window vents, leave them open permanently Use a dehumidier and moisture traps on windowsills to remove damp from the air Dry any condensation from windows and windowsills Clear out roof gutters regularly to avoid water overflowing onto your walls Check roof tiles and fascia boards and repair any leaks or rotting wood Check that your damp-proof course is above the ground level of your home Fix plumbing leaks quickly and dry the area.

Suffering from concussion and a cut nose she was rushed to hospital in an ambulance where she was treated by concerned medical staff. But Cindy’s fall was not an accident at all. Instead she was suffering from factitious disorder - also known as Munchausen’s syndrome - and had collapsed on purpose. The condition, which sees someone pretend to be ill, or actively try to make themselves ill, in order to receive care, sympathy and attention, has been a lelong affliction for Cindy. She remembers faking flu when she was four and today at  still falls to deliberately hurt herself. “One time I swallowed a whole tin of Tiger Balm, because camphor is known to cause seizures and I wanted to induce one,” she admits. “I’ve probably given myself about  concussions over the years and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been in ambulances. I face plant and don’t put my hands out to protect myself, so I land head first on the concrete. I do it in public places like a supermarket, a bus stop or a busy street. “It’s about receiving attention and tenderness. When I’m being lted into an ambulance there is that feeling of being carried and of being loved and looked after – I feel comforted and peaceful it’s a very powerful feeling. If someone didn’t treat me with tenderness I didn’t bother doing it around them anymore. So it was unfortunate that the people who were kindest to me got the brunt of my bad behaviour.” It’s a condition that is currently being highlighted on screen in Coronation Street. Medical student Curtis Delamere has spent months convincing concerned fiance Emma Brooker and her dad Steve McDonald that he is dying from an incurable heart complaint.But shocked viewers this week saw Curtis’s doctor confirm, that as they’ve told him many times, there’s nothing wrong with his heart and that he’s suffering from factitious disorder. Curtis is only  and it turns out he has had the condition for years. Actor Sam Retford, who plays Curtis, says he hopes viewers won’t hate his character as his deception and manipulation are exposed.  As part of his factitious disorder, Curtis has lied that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Sam says: “I hope viewers will have sympathy. He’s not sitting there in the morning thinking: ‘what lies am I going to tell today ’ It’s not malicious. He’s just lonely. “If we could all have a button we could press and it means that people love you, of course we would all day long, because it’s a nice thing that people care for you.” For Cindy too the problems began in childhood. “I actually can’t remember a time when I didn’t have the disorder,” she recalls. “As young as four I pretended I had flu, or didn’t feel very well. “When I was six I would purposely try to fall off swings and hurt myself. I got a few bruises and I was always a bit disappointed it wasn’t more!”  She is puzzled why it developed. “The only thing I’ve been able to think is that my Mum had really bad migraines,” she says. “She’d be in bed and couldn’tand I remember being left to fend on my own quite a bit. Maybe it was a way of getting people’s attention so I had more support.” As Cindy got older the disorder got worse and when she got to high school she began pretending to faint. “I got attention for the fainting, so that turned into pretending I had seizures. I’d shake and people said I must have epilepsy,” she recalls. “At university it got so bad that even though my EEG tests were normal, they decided to put me onto medication. “It spiralled out of control and I wound up in the hospital in a seizure monitoring unit. They were talking about brain surgery at one point to stop the seizures. That was pretty scary, but the problem with the disorder is that I’ve always wanted to be sick, so I was actually hoping that they would do surgery. That’s the crazy thing. “Over the years I’ve also taken five overdoses and all except one were part of the factitious disorder. It was a way of getting attention.”  Cindy, who lives in Alberta, Canada is one of the few people in the world to admit publicly to having the disorder. Psychiatry professor Marc Feldman, the world authority on the illness, says that it is notoriously hard to detect. He explains: “Even physicians can miss a diagnosis and many patients continue their denial. Then,the patient lies about what is going on, a therapist is not going to be able to address it, so you have to work slowly to build trust.” So determined were Coronation Street to get the storyline right that they contacted Dr Marc Feldman who did Zoom interviews with researchers and writers and also spoke atto actor Sam. He says: “Afterwards they sent me pages of scripts with specic questions, such as: ‘does this ring true ’ They wanted to get it as accurate as possible. “I’ve written so much about factitious disorder over the past  years and I was more than happy to help. It seemed a great opportunity to make the public more aware of the disorder.” The most extreme case of factitious disorder was that of Wendy Scott who was admitted to hospital  times under  pretences and had  abdominal operations. Born in Scotland she was known to hospitals throughout Europe. Sadly, when she suffered real pain nobody believed her. Eventually it was discovered that she had advanced abdominal cancer from which she died in .  Dr Feldman, who has interviewed hundreds of patients with the disorder, says: “I had one patient who instilled a caustic substance into her bladder, ultimately forcing the bladder to be removed. She now has a bag. Some of the cases are quite shocking.” The syndrome was first identied in the s and named Munchausen’s Syndrome after German aristocrat Baron Munchausen, who was known for his exaggerated story-telling. Factitious disorder imposed on another, previously called Munchausen’s by proxy, is a iant of the syndrome, in which someone fakes or induces illness in someone under their care, usually a mother with their child. The disorder has taken its toll on Cindy’s health. “There’s been a little bit of cognitive impairment, some memory issues. I notice after concussions that I haven’t been as sharp,” she admits. “I’ve also damaged a nerve in my face, so I can’t lt my left eyebrow. I’ve had lots of black eyes, bloody noses and stitches.” Cindy, who is single, has had boyfriends in the past, but kept them and all her friends and family in the dark about her condition. It was only after being diagnosed as bipolar in her s that she first confessed to a doctor. Now she is on medication for her bipolar disorder she has fewer impulses to harm herself or fake illness. Ten years ago she found religion which has also helped. “That was a lot of comfort to me – I could get attention from God,” she explains. After writing her memoir Liar, Liar, Gown on Fire, she says those close to her now understand more about the disorder and whilst many were initially angry, they have forgiven her for the deceit, Yet Cindy doubts she will ever properly recover. “I still do it sometimes I did it as recently as this summer. It’s become a coping mechanism when I’m under stress,” she says. “I don’t really think I’ll ever be cured. It’s been part of my le forever. It’s not just a matter of faking it, I actually want to be physically ill and that has never gone away. StillI get a little bit of a cough, I’m hoping its Covid.”For more information go to munchausen Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronation StreetHospitalsHeart diseaseMental healthSoap operasPrescriptionsFluFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

Thousands of residents in the northeast of England still have no power six days after the mph icy blast swept through the country.Durham County Council raised the alert after recording that , homes are still living in darkness.Several schools in the area remain closed due to building damage and lack of power, heat, electricity or working phone lines, Chronicle Live reports.A caravan site in Berwick-upon-Tweed in Northumberland was one of the worst-hit spots - where several holiday homes were crushed by the force of the storm.  Today diggers were seen clearing up large amounts of debris after the caravans were ripped apart, in some cases leaving behind just the base. Kitchen cabinets, TVs and sofas were left exposed to the elements as a result, and debris can be seen on the seafront which appears to have blown over the edge of the clf. Resident Brian Burgon, , said the site was a devastation scene.  Brian said: The caravans have been broken apart like balsa wood. Itaposs a devastation scene. Brian was one of the lucky ones whose power was restored shortly after the storm.  But the electrician said the damage to the area is like nothing Iaposve ever seen before. He said: In some parts, itaposs like an atom bomb dropped. I have seen trees that snapped like twigs. Northumberland councillor Steven Bridgett said that five towns and villages in north east Northumberland still have no power after six days. He said: The number has come down signicantly from what it was.  A lot of those without power are small hamlets and farms - and some we have no way of communicating with. We have sadly had someone pass away, although they did have underlying health conditions. But having no heat and power could have been a contributing factor - it definitely didnapost help. Today we have boots on the ground knocking doors of residents with no power, finding out what they need. We are offering food and drinks and accommodationthey canapost live in their homes.

He said: Iaposve called them three times and emailed as well.

Keith said a big issue is now that children are able to access the train line, by using the gap in his fence, and he fears for their safety. He added: Iaposve got children climbing over as well. Theyaposre about six or seven and keep trying to come down. Thereaposs a school just down the road. We have to sit there constantly in limbo watching to make sure the kids donapost get on the wall and climb on the track again. Thereaposs also debris from the fence on the ground. If it blows in front of a train it could cause accidents. On the Network Rail website the company states: We’re responsible for the fencing that forms the boundary to the railway. If there’s a problem with our fencing we will either fix the fence or replace it. This doesn’t apply to other fences that may be parallel to our boundary measure. If there’s a gap and we can’t immediately carry out a permanent repair, then weaposll do a temporary repair first of all. If we can’t repair the fence to a safe standard, and a fence is needed to keep the railway safe, we’ll replace it with a new one of a similar size and type.  Keith said in the past he has had to have staff from Network Railaposs health and safety team on site when work was carried out on his house. He said: The fence isnapost on my property itaposs next to the railway track so itaposs up to them to replace it. When I got some work done down the side of my house, their health and safety team had to be there. They wouldnapost let anyone on the wall side of the track, so I canapost see it being my responsibility on that side of the wall. A Network Rail spokesperson said: “Storm Arwen cause widespread destruction across the country’s rail network and our engineers are working round the clock to fix the damage.

In the BBC documentary, The Princes and The Press, Jenny Afia said there were massive inaccuracies in the story that Meghan had bullied some of her staff.The allegations surfaced publicly in March this year and were branded a calculated smear campaign by the Sussexes, who fiercely deny any wrongdoing.On True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal expert Richard Kay questioned Meghanaposs lawyeraposs remarks.He said: “The thing that struck me about Jenny Afia was where she categorically said, as Meghan’s lawyer, that the allegations of bullying were untrue.  She is in no position to know that. She could have said ‘I am advised as her lawyer that the allegations are untrue’, but she wasn’t there and she doesn’t know what the nature of the investigation by Buckingham Palace is, [and] which is still ongoing into the claims and counterclaims.”During the documentary, broadcast on Monday night, Ms Afia was asked by presenter Amol Rajanthe story about bullying allegations, which first appeared in The Times, was accurate.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She told the programme: The overall allegation was that the Duchess of Sussex is guilty of bullying. Absolutely not. The first thing is to be really clear about what bullying is. What bullying actually means is improperly using power deliberately and repeatedly to hurt someone physically or emotionally. The Duchess of Sussex has absolutely denied ever doing that. That said, she wouldnapost want to negate anyoneaposs personal experience. When askedshe provided any evidence to refute the claims, the lawyer added: It is really hard to prove a negative. Soyou havenapost bullied someone how do you prove you havenapost.  Just denying the allegation... doesnapost address the underlying problem that the allegation has been made.The documentary, which aired its first part last week, set out to explore the relationships between Princes William and Harry and the press.In the first episode last week, there were claims that negative stories about Meghan were leaked by courtiers and there was competitiveness between William and Harry’s respective households.

Experts are worried that the Omicron iant could be more transmissible, though this has not yet been confirmed. It is still unknownit is also more resistant to vaccines and how bad its symptoms are. Cases are currently low in the UK and research is underway to try and work outthe iant is going to be more of a problem, but medical experts advised caution and new restrictions were put in place as a result. One way of combating the spread is through these restrictions, which has seen mandatory mask-wearing reintroduced on public transport, in shops and a range of other outlets.However, this does not necessarily help over the long-term and as viruses continue to mutate and change, there is now talk about people having to have regular jabs to keep the disease at bay. So will we have to have regular Covid jabs  Will we need to have annual Covid booster jabs   The government has already extended its booster jab programme to all eligible adults, who can expect to receive their booster by the end of January.Now though, the boss of vaccine creator and pharmaceutical company Pfizer has said that yearly vaccinations may be required.Dr Albert Bourla told the BBC : Based on everything I have seen so far, I would say that annual vaccinations… are likely to be needed to maintain a very robust and very high level of protection. Bourla also said that targeting areas where viruses can flourish would be a positive step. Schools, for example, have a high concentration of people, so vaccinating young children would help prevent against a large spread of the virus. The Pfizer jab has already been approved in the US for five to -year-olds. Covid in schools is thriving, Bourla said. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it. Is a new vaccine for the Omicron mutant iant being made   Vaccines work by helping our body to produce the correct antibodies should an infection occur, but this is more dficult to keep on top of once a virus mutates. Essentially, the codes we have to fight off the virus are working against something slightly dferent than before. As a result, opinion is split onthe current vaccines will work against the Omicron iant and there is already work underway to tweak the vaccine. The boss of Moderna warned that the current vaccine would not be as effective.  Ugur Sahinaposs opinion dfered from the Moderna boss. The CEO of BioNTechtold Sky News: To my mind thereaposs no reason to be particularly worried. The only thing that worries me at the moment is the fact that there are people that have not been vaccinated at all. NBC News reported that Pfizer and BioNTech said they could develop an Omicron-specic vaccine within six weeks and ship initial batches within  daysthis is needed.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pfizer Inc.SchoolsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The research, which has not been peer-reviewed, found people who had tested positive for Covid could pick up the virus again. It did not say how the iant will behave when spreading in a highly vaccinated population such as the UK, or whether the virus can evade the protection offered by vaccines against severe disease. The new study estimated that the risk of reinfection for November  to , when Omicron was circulating, was . times higher than in the first wave of the pandemic in early . In contrast, the risk of reinfection in South Africa was lower in the Beta and Delta waves than in the first wave. The findings suggest Omicron could cause a wave of infections in people with some prior immunity.  The researchers, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases , looked at data from almost . million people with Covid- who had a positive test result at least  days before November . Some , suspected reinfections were identied among the ,, people . The authors concluded: Population-level evidence suggests that the Omicron iant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection. In contrast, there is no population-wide epidemiological evidence of immune escape associated with the Beta or Delta iants.  This finding has important implications for public health planning, particularly in countries like South Africa with high rates of immunity from prior infection. Urgent questions remain regarding whether Omicron is also able to evade vaccine-induced immunity and the potential implications of reduced immunity to infection on protection against severe disease and death. Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, regional emergency director for the World Health Organisationaposs Regional Office for Africa, told a press briefing there was concern about reinfections. She said: We monitor these reinfectionsfor the Beta and for the Delta wave we didnapost see an increase in reinfections over and above what weexpect when the force of infection changes when the wave stops. However we are seeing an increase for Omicron. And that speaks to the fact that in our population with a high seroprevalence - so where many people have had previous infection - we believe that their previous infection does not provide them protection from infection due to Omicron. However, hopefully it provides them with protection against severe disease, hospital admissions and death. She said the susceptibility of the population of South Africa is greater now because previous infection used to protect against Delta and now with Omicron and doesnapost seem to be the case. But she added: We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease because weaposve seen this decrease in protection using vaccines with the other iants - the vaccines have always held out to prevent severe disease and admission into hospital from death. The same things that held true for the other iants, I think, to a large extent hold true for this iant. Professor Francois Balloux, from University College London , said the findings were not surprising given the number of mutations in the new iant. He said the research could not account for waning levels of immunity. He added: Risk of reinfection by the Omicron iant was estimated to be around three times higher than by the Alpha and Delta iant. The study is competently performed and highly timely as it provides the first direct evidence for the increased ability of the Omicron iant to partially bypass prior host immunity conferred by prior infection. The study does not provide any insight on the robustness of vaccine-induced immunisation against the Omicron iant. It also does not report any data on infection severity. South Africa has a low vaccination rate but a large proportion of the population has been infected during previous Covid- waves. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The population of South Africa also tend to be fairly young with a median age of . years. As such, the results from this study are not directly portable to other settings such as Europe or North America, and more data will be needed before we can make more any robust prediction about the potential threat posed by a global spread of the Omicron iant in dferent parts of the world. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: This analysis does look very concerning, with immunity from previous infections being relatively easily bypassed. Might this all still be a  alarm  That is looking less and less likely. We do not yet have up-to-date information on vaccine effectiveness. However, the situation should, to some extent, be dferent with vaccine-generated immunity. The immune response from vaccination is much stronger when compared with infection-acquired immunity. Whilst there is likely to be some impact, it is likely vaccines will still provide some level of protection. The booster dose may be key here in maintaining a high level of protection. Whilst we await more data to emerge over the coming days and weeks, the message to the general public has to be: go and get all the doses you are eligible for. Keep that protection as high as possible.

Mr Fawcett, who resigned as the Foundationaposs chief executive after a string of allegations, was also involved in directing money from a Saudi billionaireaposs foundation to another charity of which Charles was patron, it was revealed. Dame Sue Bruce, chair of the Princeaposs Foundation, described the recent crises surrounding the future kingaposs charitable organisation as a dficult chapter, but said lessons will be learned to ensure the charity always acts with the utmost integrity and probity. A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince was grateful to independent auditors for reviewing procedures. He added: It is important to His Royal Highness that the charities which bear his name operate to the highest standards, in accordance with rules established by charity regulators. We are taking this opportunity to reinforce guidance to these charities, particularly in respect of their relationships with supporters. The independent investigation into fundraising practices was ordered by the Foundation and carried out independently by auditing firm Ernst  Young.  Its findings, released on Thursday, will be shared with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator , which is examining dealings at the Foundation. A summary of the findings revealed that Mr Fawcett and another unnamed senior employee were involved in directing a transfer of funds from the Mahfouz Foundation to the Children and the Arts Foundation , which is now defunct. The activity, including written correspondence, took place without the knowledge or approval of The Princeaposs Foundation trustees, according to the investigation. The Charity Commission has launched an inquiry into the Mahfouz Foundation, which was founded by Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, into allegations that donations intended for the Princeaposs Foundation went to CATA instead. The Princeaposs Foundation initially received £, from Russian banker Dmitry Leus, via the Mahfouz Foundation, but Charlesaposs charityaposs ethics committee rejected the money and ed it to the Mahfouz Foundation. Mr Fawcett was subsequently involved in directing a transfer of funds from the Mahfouz Foundation to CATA, the summary said. The investigation also found evidence of Mr Fawcettaposs communications and co-ordination with so-called aposfixersapos regarding honorary nominations for a donor between -, the summary said, but trustees were not aware at the time of this correspondence. Dame Sue said: The board of trustees agreed unequivocally that the recent allegations had to be independently investigated so that the facts could be established, and all necessary steps could be taken to address the issues identied.

The board of trustees is determined that lessons will be learned to ensure that, in future, our charity maintains the highest standards in all areas and always acts with the utmost integrity and probity. As we move through this dficult chapter, I hope that the stories of note will begin to focus once more on the beneficial outcomes delivered by The Princeaposs Foundation, and we look forward with optimism to continuing to deliver our charitable activities.

A further  people who had meals at the pub on October , , were also unwell while only three diners were fine and that was because they ordered vegetarian options, , reported the Daily Star.. John Croucher, the -year-old former head chef, was handed a four-month suspended jail sentence at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday.Members of the Holy Trinity Church gathered for a meal at the pub but the meat in the shepherdaposs pie was not cooked properly the night before, the court heard.  Croucher admitted that he had been rushed and placed the meat, which had not been fully cooked, in cling film in the fridge. The next day it was cooked again with mashed potato but the temperature of the meat wasnapost checked. Croucher admitted to contravening food regulations and said: I really hate to say it but I think I was rushed. I was rushing. Remorse is an understatement. This is something I will never forget. Because of it, I am a better chef and it is just a shame the cost of it had to be what it was. Neil Billingham, the -year-old owner and landlord, admitted to three charges of contravening food regulations.  He was personally fined £,, plus £, court costs, and his company The Bobcat Pub Co was fined nearly £,. Judge Sarah Campbell said: A healthy and well person died of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced from vomiting. No sentence I can pass can reflect the loss caused to the family. The Crewe Arms is an important pub to the local community. I have read many references from members of the community, who all say Mr Billingham worked hard to maintain the support of the community, including Mrs Neuman’s daughter. But the judge refused to accept claims that it was a one-off mistake. While it has since gained the maximum five star food hygiene rating, at the time of the tragedy the Crewe Arms had just one star. Prosecutor Carl May-Smith pointed out how food safety officers had even been trying to help venues in the area with low ratings. He said: The pub even had the advantage of coaching from the local authority. Inspections before the offence showed there was no food safety management system in place.

Pat Aldridge spent five days in hospital where she needed intermittent oxygen.But doctors were amazed as she made a full recovery and was able to be discharged andhome to Nynehead Court in Wellington, Somerset.The day after her discharge, she was already back taking part in quizzes, coffee mornings, knitting and going for her daily walk around the care home grounds. And she was able to enjoy proper birthday celebrations to mark her th year, which included a visit from her family in the morning before a party in the afternoon with staff and residents, plus a special cake baked for her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Home manager, Joanne Fenn, said: We were delighted to be able to help Pat share her special day. She is a remarkable lady, who has reached a wonderful age. Pat said that although she doesnapost really eat cake she was looking forward to a piece of birthday cake. She loved her flowers but asked for them to be spread around the home for everyone to enjoy. She is an absolute delight to look after and enjoys nothing more than a lovely sing-song with staff and other residents.  Pat was born in Solihull on November  , four months after the outbreak of the First World War. She was one of eight children and is the only one of her siblings to reach the age of . Pat was married to her husband, Ken, for  years until she was widowed in . She lived independently in the community until recently when she decided to move to Nynehead Court to remain close to her friends. Staff there had initially noticed she had low oxygen levels during her daily check-in April last year and was given antibiotics which didnapost improve. She tested positive for Covid- on arrival in hospital but says she didnapost need an oxygen mask. She was put on oxygen and staff say that even on the morning after she was admitted she already wanted to get up and about to do everything for herself.  At the time Pat said: I did not have a high temperature until the night I was admitted to hospital. I wasnapost frightened of seeing hospital staff in PPE as I had seen staff at the home wearing it and I donapost really remember the moment I was told I had beaten the virus. But I am just pleased to be back amongst my friends at the home and I feel as bright as I can for someone my age. Since I have come out of hospital, I have enjoyed catching up with my knitting which I do every day and have also attended an in-house coffee morning and a quiz. I donapost remember much about the virus. But my advice to everyone  at the moment is just to take each day as it comes and appreciate the small things, whatever age you are. Staff at Nynehead Court described Pat as a very stoical and resilient lady who never complains and takes each day as it comes. They added that sheaposs a very sociable lady who enjoys going to a lunch club on Wednesdays. She has previously put her long le down to her healthy diet which restricts sugar and fat, especially cake. Musgrove Park Doctor Benedict Morris previously said he had concerns for Pat when her infection became clear. He said: We always worry about anyone who tests positive, particularly those who are a little bit older. You do worry but she is made of stern stuff and thataposs what we saw when we met her. It was absolutely remarkable. She has made an amazing recovery.Do you have a hopeful story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO adviser, said: “In terms of the severity profile, we have seen reports of cases with Omicron that go from mild disease all the way to severe disease. “There is some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild disease, but again it is early days. We do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases that are being detected.  “There is also a suggestion of increased hospitalisations across South Africa, but that could be the sheer fact that we have more cases. “If you have more cases you will have more hospitalisations.” Meanwhile, a health director in Botswana said  out of  people infected had no symptoms, while the other three had “very, very mild” illness.

Mr Johnson said “we don’t want people to feel that they need to start cancelling things” and insisted that “Christmas this year will be considerably better than Christmas last year”. He was speaking after business minister George Freeman appeared to muddy the waters by suggesting parties may depend on how many people are attending, while Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey suggested “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with “people you don’t already know”. Health Secretary Sajid Javid “people can snog who they wish”, adding that people should be cautious but “it’s got nothing to do with the Government who you kiss or anything like that”. But Dr Penelope Toff, chair of the BMA’s public health medicine committee said “contradictory public health messages about Covid- are very unhelpful for everyone”. Dr Toff said: “There should be no confusion about what to do over the festive period. “There have been persistently high levels of Covid- infections in the community in recent months, and we now have a new iant circulating, which is worrying. “Stronger measures need to be implemented without delay, to prevent even higher rates of spread of the virus in the community. “People need to be encouraged to avoid large groups, to meet only outdoors where possible and face masks should be worn in all public indoor spaces except when people are seated to eat and drink.” In a joint statement, UKHospitality, the British Institute of Innkeeping and the British Beer  Pub Association urged those with Christmas plans “not to cancel”, with bookings down on previous years.

Sarah Beckett was doing her shopping at her local store when her e-cigarette battery reportedly exploded in her pocket. Shoppers raced to the -year-oldaposs rescue when she began to scream as her clothes went up in flames. The quick-thinking heroes doused her in water they had grabbed from bottles on the shelves, stopping her from getting badly injured. Her husband Andrew Beckett believes the cause of the explosion may have been a spare battery from an electronic cigarette that Sarah was carrying in her pocket. He told the Liverpool Echo:[She was] walking around Aldi and feels and hears something in her pocket, all seems a bit surreal but she remembers screaming and a older couple coming to her assistance. Weaposve later found out from a guy on Facebook that these batteries can shortthe positive end comes in contact with say a key or a coin.So it shorted in her pocket and exploded like a firework when you first light it, lighting her clothes, coat and jumper. Andy said luckily there were some brilliant people in the store who immediately jumped in to help after seeing Sarah, from Newton-le -Willows in distress. He said: An old couple came rushing over, as she opened her coat the red hot battery slid out of the hole it had melted and bounced along the floor still glowing orange. The old lady kicked it away, grabbed a chair from somewhere and started to douse her with water from the shelf in Aldi. The older lady stayed with her all the way through, rubbing her arms and comforting her.  Andy said he was working in North Wales when he got the awful phone call from his weaposs phone. He added: A young man then took her phone and rang me from it, I could hear her screaming and panicking in the background. I keep thinking that a few minutes earlier she would have been driving on the main roads of Newton-Le-Willows and it haunts me to think what might have happened. I think we both had a little private whimper to ourselves last night when I got her home, she was very lucky, and also very lucky that certain members of public were in the shop at the same time. People definitely need to be made aware, we didnapost have the slightest idea the dangers of a loose battery. Sarah, who was taken to hospital, is now recovering at home after receiving suspected second degree burns which she is receiving treatment for at Whiston Hospital burns unit.

I guess I was just doomed from the start.  I wasnapost throwing up too much just because there wasnapost anything in my stomach so it wasnapost like the nasty, nasty throw up. My sister had a fan on my baby nephew, she came over to put that fan on me and as sheaposs holding my nephew, he starts pooping. And the poop goes down her arm onto my dress.

Epstein’s former housekeeper Juan Alessi today took to the stand in Maxwell’s sex grooming and abuse trial in New York to detail how his job changed when she arrived. From the day she came to the house, she right away took over and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house,” said Alessi, who managed the Florida property from  to . The -year-old, who once visited Maxwell’s London home, said his relationship with Epstein was cordial until she arrived.  “Only I was supposed to speak to Mr Epstein when he asked me questions,” Alessi recalled as one of Maxwell’s missives. “At the end of my stay, there was a time when she say, ‘Jeffrey doesn’t like to be looked at in his eyes. You should never look at his eyes - just look at another part of the room and answer him.” Alessi went on to detail what became expected of him including ensuring “the cars had to be immaculate,” and filled with  bills while “the house had to be run like a five-star hotel.” When he was asked by the prosecutionhe ever saw females by the pool, Mr Alessi replied hundreds of times.” Asked what percentage were they topless, he said “about  per cent to  per cent of the time.” Pushed further about Maxwell’s time at the house, where Prince Andrew once stayed and which was knocked down earlier this year, the former housekeeper was asked where she slept when in the home. “She would sleep in Mr Epsteinaposs bedroom,” he replied. Mr Alessi said Maxwell, , refused to call him by his real name, Juan, instead addressing him by its English adaptation. “She called me John,” he said. Mr Alessi said he worked long hours for the couple, clocking up to  hours per sht when he began working for the financier in . Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The former house manager said Epstein usually left Palm Beach on a Monday or Tuesday and ed by Thursday or Friday. “It was very hectic. A lot of work. A lot of work,” he told the jury. Mr Alessi complained about the y checklist of tasks Maxwell had him perform, which he said was made for ten men, not one and a half. He called it very degrading to him. The full indictment against her lists six charges: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transporting a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking of a minor. The defendant is further alleged to have lied under oath by hiding her participation in Epsteinaposs offences during a separate civil case. These offences are to be heard at a later date in a separate trial. Maxwell, who has been held in a US jail since her arrest in July last year, denies all charges. If convicted she faces up to  years in prison. Epstein committed suicide in August  while in jail. He was arrested a month earlier and charged with child sex offences.

It looks pretty funny.I feel sorry for the lads because I might have caught them out there a bit, but it happens. I didnapost mean to catch anything like that. It was a complete coincidence. I remember taking the photo but I didnapost notice anything. The girls were enjoying the chance to get a photo and I was just focusing on them. Iaposm always keeping an eye out for anything that looks inappropriate but nothing like that stood out to me with this one.  I wasnapost even aware of the photo going viral, but the DJ told me about it when I went into work. Iaposm editing these at the end of my sht at about am, so admittedly every now and again I do miss something. I sort through ones that are definitely not suitable to go on. Normally Iaposll get a message from someone telling me to take it down, but nobodyaposs been in touch about this one anyway. He added that heaposs surprised this photo has captured the attention of so many Facebook users, but heaposs found the reaction funny. The photo, which was taken between am and am, has now racked up more than  interactions - including many laughing faces from amused fans of the nightclub.

Alongside this, she shared images of her original designs for the company.This year Jewel said she wouldnapost be readdressing the Wrapped story format, but she did share a link to an interview she did in  with MSN all about it.She told the publication that at age  she came up with the story format as part of a project she was working on as an intern at Spoty to make Wrapped appeal better to Gen Z. Jewel claims she presented the idea to the company on her last day working with them and it was well-received but she had no idea it would grow to become what it is today. She continued to claim that she didnapost receive so much as a thank you for her contribution, although this didnapost surprise her. This was not my first corporate position, so I know that’s not really the practice, she said. Because the reality is, at the end of the day, they legally have the right to. That’s the reason it’s such an issue. It’s not just Spoty personally. They’re cool people. But these corporations, they own all their intern content. Jewel added that she did enjoy her internship at Spoty, she had a good time and loved the people she worked with. She states that she also received a stipend during her internship - one which was more generous than many other companies may offer - but she knows itaposs not a substitute for a real salary or other remuneration. Stipend - that word alone doesn’t sound right for major ideas, but that’s it. How would you have any idea when you’re onboarding that you’re going to create something so groundbreaking  At the time the MSN article was published, Spoty told the publication that it was not accurate to say that Wrapped’s stories format can be credited to one intern, as hundreds of people work on Wrapped at the company.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

autumn evening after the local birds have gone quiet, you may hear thin, plaintive whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

meeting to discuss the future of the service, before he received a response.The X bus was suspended last year by East Coast Buses, a subsidiary of Lothian Buses, following the introduction of national lockdown restrictions.The service ran through North Berwick, Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry, then directly to Edinburgh via the A.Commuters from Dirleton, Gullane and Aberlady now face an extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry reached out to me about the X bus, I launched a petition calling for the reinstatement of the service.ldquoI wrote to East Coast Buses on two occasions requesting a face-to-face meeting, and followed this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council. That makes it accountable to the residents of our community.ldquoThe number of signatures on the petition shows the clear strength of feeling in the area about reinstating the X bus.ldquoAt this point, Lothian Buses have their heads buried in the sand ndash they cannot keep ignoring our communities.In a letter to Mr Hoy dated November , Nigel Serafini, interim managing director of Lothian Buses, said it was the companyrsquos ldquopriority to re-establish the X ldquoas soon as driver resource permits.He added: ldquoThe X covers no additional areas that service  does not .ldquoIn contrast, the X is the only service that operates to East Linton, West Barns and Dunbar. Without the X these communities would be without a regular bus service whilst, as explained, the same is not true of Gullane, Aberlady and Dirleton.A spokesperson for East Coast Buses added: ldquoEast Coast Buses is absolutely committed to delivering for all of our customers in East Lothian.ldquoLike many other transport providers at this time, we are in an extremely challenging recruitment market, which, coupled with our safety protocols for colleagues who find themselves in the Covid- track and trace cycle, means that we are experiencing signicant resourcing dficulties in our driving team on a day-to-day basis.ldquoWith limited available resource, we have made the dficult decision to prioritise key services which provide as many transport links as possible throughout East Lothian. In terms of service provision for Gullane and Aberlady, we have focused on delivering service , which provides critical local links along the coast as well as direct travel to Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"fate-rail-underpass-depends-new-housing-scheme-decision-dunbar","story":"Hundreds of new homes have been built at Hallhill, south of the railway line, in Dunbar in recent years.However, pedestrian links between the new homes and the older section of Dunbar are limited.East Lothian Council is keen to see a new pedestrian underpass to improve connections, which could be financed in part through another housing development in the area.It is expected that the cost of the underpass would be more than pound million, with part of the cost being covered by the Hallhill North development, which would consist of  houses and  flats.A decision is set to be made on the plans, which come from Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Hallhill Developments Limited, at a meeting of East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee on Tuesday.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who chairs the local authorityrsquos planning committee and represents Dunbar on East Lothian Council, noted that currently the only pedestrian access in the area was under the railway line beside Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: ldquoAs part of the application, the developer will be making a contribution to a new underpass at the railway.ldquoThere will not be enough funding coming from the developer to completely do this underpass.ldquoThat has to be done through grant funding from other agencies and the council themselves.ldquoAt the moment, all the houses from the Hallhill area to get to both the lower primary school and secondary school have to come underneath the tunnel, and children going to the Lochend Campus have to come back through that one.ldquoIt is really congested and we definitely need another way through there.An underpass was previously in place under the railway line but it was blocked up a number of years ago.Network Rail was approached about seeing it reopened but was not keen on the idea and East Lothian Council would have been liable for the structure.Mr Hampshire said: ldquoWe have to go with a completely new cut-through for pedestrians and cyclists, which will come through into Ash Grove swing park area but will be a safe route to get to the secondary school.Drawings and documents for the planning application were first submitted to East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department at the beginning of February last year.The scheme, to the west of the primary schoolrsquos Lochend Campus, originally featured  houses and  apartments."},{"url":null,"title":"storyteller-tim-porteus-standing-greens-preston-seton-gosford-by-election","story":"The -year-old, from Prestonpans, will also stand for the party in the ward at the full East Lothian Council elections next May.The early years charity worker ndash who writes the weekly Timrsquos Tales column for the Courier ndash works in Midlothian assisting children and families, and lives with his we Kate and three youngest children.Mr Porteus said: ldquoI am standing because I believe my community has amazing assets in its people and beautul natural setting, but we also have our issues that need to be addressed.ldquoI am passionate about education and childrenrsquos wellbeing but, here in East Lothian, we see signicant local issues around education provision and opportunities for our young people.ldquoThey have also been very adversely affected by Covid restrictions.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-shouldnt-get-excited-one-rogue-poll","story":"Nicola Sturgeon is caught between a rock and a hard place and how she handles this is critical. The SNP was always a party of protest and dissent. Now it is experiencing the real dilemmas such behaviour creates for those in authority.Indyref is still in the melting pot and the manold crises in the NHS are not going away, to say nothing of all the other pressing problems in her in-tray. Ms Sturgeon has ridden her luck for many years now. Is it about to run out Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.* JOHN Dunloplikes to submit short acerbic letters to The Herald, usually with an anti-Scottish independence slant. Perhaps he was a bit premature with his latest effort, given the result of the recent Ipsos-Mori poll showing support for Scottish independence at %. Could it be that the electorate of Scotland really do want to catch up with the rest of the modern world, including Barbados Alec Oattes, Ayr.PARTYS OVER FOR JOHNSONCOME on over to his place,Come on, hes having a party.With loads of booze and plenty of nibbles,Boris is having a party tonight.How very galling, how very Downing Street one rule for us and another for those behind the black door. While we all wearily faced another lockdown last Christmas, after a frightening year, and with the prospect of spending a dismal festive season cut off from family and friends, No  staff were merrily rocking round the clock . Whether he was present or not, the party took place within the Prime Ministers official home and on his watch.Given all of Mr Johnsons gaffes since he took office, perhaps we shouldnt really be surprised at this one, but somehow this latest example of cynical insensitivity and lack of solidarity with the rest of the population really sticks in the craw. Mr Johnson declares that all Covid guidelines were followed, but seems unable to grasp that holding the party at all was a breach of his own rules.The partys over for Mr Johnson it will take him a long time to clear up the mess.Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHATS GREAT ABOUT THE CENTRE MARK Smith claims he identies with Sir Keir Starmer because the Labour leader is \"attempting to steer the Labour Party back to the \"centre\" .Perhaps he could elaborate and tell us the last time the Labour Party was in the \"centre\". The last Labour government which I voted for in  will, in my opinion, forever be associated with the following: its kow-towing to the Bush White House and the oil billionaires which determined its policy its sycophancy towards media moguls and policies which allowed the City of London to run rampant. The upshot of course was the biggest financial collapse in the countrys history and one of the biggest foreign policy disasters in the countrys history.Is this Mr Smiths centre Many people I feel will still be in the dark about what Sir Keir stands for perhaps he has let Mr Smith in on his secret. It is worth remembering that the most effective British politician of the th century did not eschew \"radical and damaging ideologies\". This is what made Mrs Thatcher, loathe her or love her, such a towering figure.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TOO LATE TO THE PROBLEMSTHE debate in Holyrood on Wednesday on the cases of hospital-acquired infections was enlightening. The main argument from SNP politicians was that they had carried out reviews and acted on the recommendations.Just as with the impact of Storm Arwen, the SNP is always chasing its tail trying to fight fires rather than stopping them starting in the first place.Jane Lax, Aberlour.FOLLOW SWEDEN ON MP STANDARDSANDY Macivers article suggesting paying politicians more to get better service was astonishing. For the last few decades we have heard endless justications for the absurdly-high salaries paid to executives . That has not prevented financial disasters, business failures, scandals and revelations of incompetence and corruption.Mr Maciver should perhaps study the government of Sweden, where politicians do not have official cars and drivers or other privileges. They cannot vote themselves extra money for constituency travel. They live in state-owned apartments in Stockholm but do not get allowances for homes or second homes. They have no way of claiming for duck ponds or moat cleaning.Their tax s are publicly available like most other information.In  the deputy prime minister was sacked because she made a small purchase using a government credit card, despite having already refunded the money.If our politicians received salaries comparable with those paid in Sweden and worked under similar conditions, our government would be more credible. But perhaps Mr Maciver thinks that the UK is already much better managed than Sweden Peter M Dryburgh, Edinburgh.START TREATING US AS ADULTSWHILE there can be little doubt that the new Omicron iant of Covid is cause for concern, it is interesting that we are being given very little information about the state of health of the very few people who are unfortunate enough to have contracted it. Are they seriously ill  Hospitalised  Or only mildly affected We donrsquot actually know, because it would appear that governments across the UK keep this information secret in the belief that giving this information to the public would affect their attitudes towards taking precautions. The general assumption is that we canrsquot be trusted to do the right thing to prevent transmission. Well, after nearly two years of bad decisions by our leaders during which, in general, we have followed their guidance, it may be time to treat us more like adults than children.At the start of the pandemic, most of our leaders stated that there would be an open and honest consultation with the public about measures to control the spread of the disease. It didnrsquot happen then, it hasnrsquot happened since, and it isnrsquot happening now.Dave Henderson, Glasgow.FM HAS AGAIN FAILED TO ACTTEN days after Omicron was detected in Scotland the First Minister has failed to act yet again. Unlike Austria she hasnt made the vaccine compulsory, or made it compulsory for NHS or care workers like in England.Nor has she introduced eight-day isolation for people flying into Scotland despite calling for the UK Government to do it in England.She hasnt led by example by making Holyrood Parliament online again, nor has she banned hospital visits, or shutdown or curfewed pubs and nightclubs like many European countries. In other words, once again she has done nothing but try to sht the blame where. As we head towards , Covid deaths in Scotland by the end of this winter, Nicola Sturgeon should be ashamed.David Watson, Edinburgh.IN THE LINE OF FIREJILL Stephensons letterdisplays a curious lack of knowledge, as her reference to investigations would suggest she has never heard of the presumption of innocence. In her eyes it is quite okay to lambast the SNP over its actions, but not so in relation to Mr Johnsons party. I rarely write about politics, but her letter is nothing to do with politics it is about plumbing the depths of shallowness.I much prefer to write on other matters, such as the recent discussion on the elusiveness of snipe and woodcock. It brought to mind my late fathers account of a shoot in Aberdeenshire. The keeper drew up a line of shooters to walk along the face of a gentle slope, placing the men in descending order of quality, with the best shots at the higher end. Almost at once a snipe arose at the top and flew down the entireof the line, with every man firing at least one shot at it until it reached the last in the line, who downed it. The keeper walked over to pick up the bird and, on holding it aloft, declared: \"Thatll teach ye tae flee stracht.\" We should be glad such a bird exists as otherwise, Army marksmen might have ended up being called woodcockers.George F Campbell, Glasgow.Read more: I can reassure the doubters: vaccines are safer than you are being led to believe"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-kick-off-womens-six-nations-campaign-next-year-england-match","story":"Six Nations organisers have decided to keep the womenrsquos Championship in its own window, whereas previously games were played on the same weekend as the menrsquos senior and under- fixtures.

The forecasting ides the road network into inidual routes rather than geographic areas making it easier for decision makers to direct resources where they are needed most.#Each island is designated as a route, while the Mainland is ided into eight routes. Up until this year, the decision on how, and when, to treat the road network in the winter months has relied upon the information received from two weather stations at the Mill of Rango in Sandwick and at Kirkwall Airport, basically covering the East and West, while this has been helpful, it was a very broad brush.“The system is being closely monitored by officers throughout the winter season with view to summarise its performance at the conclusion of the trial next year. This will determinewe want to adopt this technology on a permanent basis.”Stressing that road safety remains the top priority, she said:“I want to reassure our communities thatwe are treating areas of the West Mainland, but not parts of the East for example, we are doing this because we are confident – based on the data – that the roads in the East do not require it.”There are km of priority one roads in Orkney, km of priority two routes and km of priority three roads.In line with nationally recommended guidance, the council’s Winter Service Policy - points out that the network will be treated in the morning when road surface temperatures are predicted to be below C, and in the afternoon when they are predicted to be below C.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are still hoping for the best and hoping that our developing understanding of this iant will reduce rather than increase our concern.“I very much hope that additional protections can be avoided and while we will act on a precautionary basis, we will always seek to act out at all times in a proportionate manner.”Research is still being undertaken on the Omicron iant — which was first discovered in southern Africa — but early indications are that it might be more transmissible than the dominant Deltra strain.However, she did say that there was no evidence that the symptoms of Omicron was dferent from Delta and the disease caused is any dferent.Scientists are also working to establish what impact this new iant will have on the effectiveness of vaccines.New recommendations are set to come from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisationis set to be announced this afternoon, and this will guide the Scottish Government on the shape of the booster programme.Ms Sturgeon said that evencurrent vaccines were less effective against the new iant, that was not the same as no effectiveness, and urged more people to come forward and become double vaccinated.She also urged travel restrictions to be tightened and called on a four nations approach in order to prevent the importation of the virus from abroad.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity.

Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSchools have been urged to avoid further closures at all costs with children having already missed too much time out of the classroom due to the Covid pandemic.The call comes from the Commissioner for Children and Young People, who said all avenues must be explored so sending pupils home from school does not become normal practice.Some schools are already preparing new timetables to begin after Christmas, having warned parents that many children will face days off as the number of staff off through Covid-related issues continues to rise across Northern Ireland, saying the situation has become a serious health and safety concern.“We should not be in a position where whole classes or year groups are learning from home because of staff shortages, as is the case in some schools,” said Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma.“That situation is untenable and urgent intervention is needed so that children receive the education they have the right to.“I welcome some of the suggestions already offered to make sure this does not become the norm, such as calling in retired teachers and redeploying teachers that are not currently working in schools.“Some older children are undertaking both mock and full GCSEs. Many children, of all ages, are only now beginning to settle back into education in the classroom.I know that school staff, unions, the Education Authority and the minister all agree that further school closures must be avoided at all costs and I urge them all to make every effort, including exploring the above suggestions, to ensure that this intolerable pressure on some schools is alleviated and our children do not have their education further disrupted.“My ‘New and Better Normal’ Report highlighted the impact of school closures on children and yet again our children and young people are anxious about their education and the services that they receive in school. Closing of schools must be avoided, the impact is much too serious for our children and young people.”Read MoreNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolAll this week, schools have been reporting severe staffing issues, with principals unable to secure substitute teachers off the NISTR register, which all substitute teachers must be registered on in Northern Ireland.Some schools are making over  telephone calls a day to get classes covered, with over , teachers absent through Covid related issues in the last four weeks and the numbers rising every day.Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, called on the Department of Education to expand the register for substitute teachers to help alleviate the situation.“We want to see them perhaps encouraging recently retired teachers to come back or incentivising teachers which are within other areas of the system, and asking them toto teaching,” she said.“There needs to be clear messaging from the department for parents and pupils and to let them know their school may be faced with this situation.”Teaching union the NASUWT added: “We are in this situation because teachers and support staff are catching Covid. Until a serious effort is made to stop the spread of Covid, more students will be sent home. At all costs, this has to be the first priority.“This means stopping all mass gatherings in schools now. Why are some schools still holding open days and parents’ evenings  Why are teachers kept on site after children have gone home for meetings ”The Department continues to urge schools to reinforce guidance available from the Public Health Agency, and said there remain no plans to introduce a series of circuit breaker school closures ahead of Christmas.“Departmental guidance requires schools to continue to implement a range of mitigations to reduce the risk of Covid- transmission including: cleaning, ventilation, face coverings, consistent groups and regular asymptomatic testing using lateral flow devices for all staff and post-primary pupils. Vaccination is available to all staff and some students.“Anyone displaying any of the key Covid- symptoms must not attend school. They should stay at home and book a Covid- test.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of Education PremiumNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolDisaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidDepartment reiterates its commitment to relationships and sex education review PremiumCovid-linked staff shortages creating ‘an absolute nightmare’ for principalsLiam Neeson’s pride as Ballymena’s first integrated primary opensMost ReadNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Thomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlySuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest CoronavirusSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageSinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill blasts ‘sinister’ bogus NI Covid restrictions messageLatestThree parties claim ‘massive’ result at Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionTories hold Old Bexley and Sidcup with reduced majority on low turnoutAlec Baldwin: I do not care about my career any more after fatal shooting on set‘Wicked’ stepmother and ‘pitiless’ father to be sentenced over Arthur’s killingEd Sheeran and Elton John face tough opposition in race for Christmas number one,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PMFacebookTwitterEmailResults from lateral flow tests will have to be registered with the official government system to be eligible for inclusion in Northern Ireland’s Covid certicate scheme.Members of the public will be expected to show notication of the negative test result before being allowed into premises where Covid passports are required.Anyone who does not have access to the digital system will be expected to undergo a lateral flow teston site but the decision on whether to offer this facility will be left to inidual businesses.Customers will also have to demonstrate vaccination status, or recent negative LFT or Covid- infection before they enter premises, as opposed to at a till or once seated, it has emerged.Meanwhile, staff working in businesses where Covid certicates are required to gain access will not have to show vaccination status.NHS officials appeared in front of the Stormont health committee on Thursday morning to explain how the controversial Covid- passport scheme will work here.The Department of Health’s head of health protection, Elaine Colgan, was asked why the system is not yet ready for use after explaining procedures are being reviewed and updated as concerns arise.She said: “We were aiming for having this ready early mid-December so that would have given us an extra week or two to work through the issues.“I think we were probably caught a little off guard on how quickly this was required,I’m honest, and that is really the crux of it.“It’s not that we weren’t working on it, we were, and with another couple of weeks we probably would have been there much better than we were on Monday.”Explaining how LFTs will be used in order to prevent abuse of the system, Ms Colgan said people will be expected to log results on the NHS system – but this only allows a person to register a test taken on the same or previous day.“When you report the result, it will askyou want to receive a notication… you are taking to get into somewhere, you will need to click ‘yes’.”Electronic notication will then be sent by phone or email which can be used under the certication scheme.The committee was told police will lead on enforcement and will visit premises to ensure businesses are adhering to the use of Covid certication.However, enforcement will not come into force and no fixed penalties will be issued until the end of the grace period on December .Earlier Health Minister Robin Swann rejected a claim made by the First Minister that Covid certicates were not based on evidence.The UUP minister said: “It’s not just about vaccination, it’s the negative lateral flow or negative PCR…I am aware there are antivaxxers trying to latch onto this to try to prove their point.“The scientic evidence, as we said about the reduction of spread for those who have been vaccinated or previously infected, there is a reduction in spread.“There is also for those who are vaccinated less chance of serious infection should they be infected.”It comes as the Department of Health revealed % of the adult population has now had at least one dose of Covid vaccine.In total, ,, jabs have been delivered since the vaccination programme began just under a year ago.On Thursday, , Covid- cases and two deaths linked to the virus were recorded in Northern Ireland.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannUlster Unionist PartyMore On Department of HealthSome

Today we have  teachers off. That equates to a quarter of our teaching staff.“Like all schools we have tried in earnest to secure substitute teachers to fill these positions to no avail. We have on several occasions, contacted over  subs on a given day to try to secure cover.“I have discussed the situation with the chair of Governors and we feel that we may have to go down the route that other post primaries are taking and ask that certain year groups stay at home on certain days.“We will be putting a plan in place in the new year. This is certainly not something we want to do and we have worked hard to avoid this so far this term but the situation is such that the measures we have in place are not sustainable with the current level of absence.”Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said contingency plans need to be in place, but we do not want to see a circuit breaker”. We would prefer itthat could be avoided, but safety has to be paramount. Be prepared is what we’re saying, but we really don’t want this to happen,” she added.But she added that “ there are not the substitute teachers in the system, then schools cannot open safely.”The Department of Education said: “There are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas period. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice. We all know that the best place for children in terms of mental health, wellbeing and education is in school.”The Department said it “is aware of the pressures schools have been facing throughout the pandemic and the dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence”. We are actively considering how best to support schools in responding to the issues they currently face and are liaising with Department of Health colleagues while continuing to follow medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive OfficeSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionReport on flags and culture just kicks can down road, says Long PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionFlags report a pointless fence-sitting exercise is a waste of five years and £kFlags report: Paramilitary flags and murals should not be displayed in Northern IrelandNew flag for Northern Ireland and bonfire enforcement among FICT report recommendationsMost ReadNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Thomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlySuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere Latest CoronavirusSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling average‘Closing of schools must be avoided’, says Children’s Commissioner Koulla YiasoumaLatestThree parties claim ‘massive’ result at Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionTories hold Old Bexley and Sidcup with reduced majority on low turnoutAlec Baldwin: I do not care about my career any more after fatal shooting on set‘Wicked’ stepmother and ‘pitiless’ father to be sentenced over Arthur’s killingEd Sheeran and Elton John face tough opposition in race for Christmas number one,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic PacemakerLisa SmythTwitterDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSome health workers in Northern Ireland could receive a one-off bonus as the Health Minister launches a bid to avert catastrophic strike action.Robin Swann has said he plans to ask for additional cash to enable him to make the payment to a range of NHS employees.While he said the final details of the financial scheme have yet to be decided, it is understood it would amount to a non-consolidated payment of .% of each employee’s salary which would only be made to workers in the lowest pay bands.Revealing plans to award a bonus to NHS staff during Stormont’s health committee meeting, Mr Swann issued an appeal for workers to not go ahead with strike action.“I would ask them not to go on industrial action because I don’t think our health service will stand any reduction in the workforce or the workforce that is there,” he said.It comes after the Department of Health announced this week that health service employees will receive a % pay rise — despite the fact unions have warned it is insufficient for a workforce that has been stretched to the limit during the pandemic.Unions have refused to rule out strike action ahead of ballots to establish whether members want to accept the %.Read MoreStab vests and body-worn cameras on the agenda to protect NI paramedics from violent assaultsMr Swann was challenged during the hearing by People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, who described the % pay award as “insulting”.Addressing the UUP minister, Mr Carroll said: “Obviously yourself, with Executive support, are imposing a % pay offer. I’ve said before, I’ll say again, it’s insulting, it’s below what they’re worth, it’s below inflation and below the rising cost of fuel and everything .“It falls way short of what these people deserve, society going through a pandemic they have saved peoples’ lives, they have dropped their loved ones, and they were with people in their darkest hour in many cases.”Mr Swann said: I would ask them not to go on industrial action because I don’t think our health service will stand any reduction in the workforce.“I am willing and have discussed with the trade unions to prioritise a bid as part of January monitoring for additional resource for an additional non-consolidated award, but again that will need approval from the Executive and the Department of Finance.“I don’t want to see them go to industrial action, it’s not something I would ask them to do and I will keep talking and working with them to make sure we don’t get to that point.”Read MoreNI waiting list crisis: Seriously ill patients competing with each other for vital operations, senior medic warnsRita Devlin from the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland said: “We have been clear from the outset that it will be our members — the nursing staff who are helping to hold the health service together — who will make a decision on whether they agreethis is a fair pay award.“Taking industrial action is not something nursing staff ever consider lightly, however, this option will be examined carefullyour members direct us to do so.”Related topicsRobin SwannDepartment of HealthPeople Before ProfitGerry CarrollThe Executive OfficeDepartment of Finance More On Robin SwannCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemNI Covid booster jabs pass , as Executive confirm keeping schools open ‘priority’ PremiumUUP defends Beattie’s US visit amid ‘work from home’ guidanceCoronavirus NI: Where to get your booster vaccine as clinics ramp up programme PremiumAnger of pub and bar owners as they blast Stormont for a lack of guidance over Covid certicate schemeMost ReadNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Thomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlySuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere Latest CoronavirusCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Two deaths and , new cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling average‘Closing of schools must be avoided’, says Children’s Commissioner Koulla YiasoumaSinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill blasts ‘sinister’ bogus NI Covid restrictions messageLatestThree parties claim ‘massive’ result at Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionTories hold Old Bexley and Sidcup with reduced majority on low turnoutAlec Baldwin: I do not care about my career any more after fatal shooting on set‘Wicked’ stepmother and ‘pitiless’ father to be sentenced over Arthur’s killingEd Sheeran and Elton John face tough opposition in race for Christmas number one,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has also separately raised issues with her employer.The statement from Ms Donaghy’s solicitor said she is “deeply concerned” about “systemic leakage of confidential Council decision making to the media and other third parties”.“The latest instance of such leaks relates to a password protected confidential email communication sent to Councillors confirming a decision on her suspension,” KRW Law added.“Within a very short time of her receiving formal correspondence about her suspension the decision was posted on social media.”The statement added that throughout this situation “she has retained her dignity in the face of often heavy media intrusion into her family and private le”.“To date there has been zero accountability on the part of the Council on the manner in which it has conducted itself on a series of issues all of which are the subject of pending disciplinary and other proceedings,” it added.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said in a statement: “We do not comment on staffing matters and no inference should be drawn from this.”Meanwhile, the DUP group leader on Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has claimed that the Food Standards Agency is to fund the employment of  Environmental Health Officers implementing checks associated with the Northern Ireland Protocol at Larne Port for three years.Councillor Gregg McKeen said he was disappointed at the development.“No amount of money offered by the Food Standards Agency will persuade us to comply with the damaging dictate of the Northern Ireland Protocol,” he said.“Apart from anything , this offer provides no guarantee for the ratepayers of Mid and East Antrim who could be left with a staggering bill for the long term, continued employment of these officers.“As committed to by the leaders of unionism in the Joint Declaration on Ulster Day, I am calling on UUP and TUV councillors to back us in opposing and rejecting the Foods Standards Agency’s lure of additional monies.”In response, Maria Jennings, FSA NI Director, said: “The Food Standards Agency’s priority is to ensure high standards of food safety and consumer protection. We are working with partners in government to determine the impacts of the Northern Ireland Protocol and supporting District Councils with the implementation of controls currently required within NI food law.“Funding for these controls is provided by the Department of Finance, facilitated by the Food Standards Agency.“District Councils with designated ports are legally responsible for carrying out checks on certain foods so that people in Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy a wide range of safe products.”Most ReadNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Thomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlySuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution rings\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ead .ece AUTOCROP wh aaaebead.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ead .ece AUTOCROP wh aaaebead.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPolice at the scene of a shooting incident in the Ballymurphy area of west Belfast Latest Northern Ireland‘I was victim of vile homophobic slurs ...and the Irish FA did nothing about it’Rory McIlroy flies out of traps to share lead in the BahamasSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionTUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter postCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemLatestThree parties claim ‘massive’ result at Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionTories hold Old Bexley and Sidcup with reduced majority on low turnoutAlec Baldwin: I do not care about my career any more after fatal shooting on set‘Wicked’ stepmother and ‘pitiless’ father to be sentenced over Arthur’s killingEd Sheeran and Elton John face tough opposition in race for Christmas number one,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Matt Alexander PA WireEimear McGovernTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast-based group of artists and activists called Array Collective, the winners of the  Turner Prize, have said their \"complex love story\" with the city theyve made their home tells the story behind their work.Emma Campbell, a member of the group, said they are completely buzzing to have won the prize in a ceremony on Wednesday night and become the first Northern Ireland winners in the history of the prestigious Tate-sponsored award.The collective, consisting of  members, will take home a £, prize and haven#t decided what they will do with the funds yet but it may have to go towards a new studio space after they were informed theirs, on King Street in the city, would be redeveloped.It#s poignant given a large part of their politically-themed work is protesting against gentrication.Read MoreTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistMs Campbell, who uses photography to express herself artistically, said they had no clue they had been nominated for the prize until they learned the news during lockdown.We had no cue about the prize and we found out in the middle of lockdown, so we had to get everybody together on a Zoom call to share the news. I manically texted everyone who thought the studio was on fire, she said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The prize was announced at a ceremony at Coventry Cathedral and Array Collective, consisting of Sighle Bhreathnach-Cashell, Sinead Bhreathnach-Cashell, Jane Butler, Alessia Cargnelli, Mitch Conlon, Clodagh Lavelle, Grace McMurray, Stephen Millar, Laura O#Connor, Thomas Wells and Ms Campbell, travelled over for the ceremony.The group met as friends first and then organically became a collective, meeting at the protests that are central for the group whose message is absolutely political. Ms Campbell said: People started approaching us to help them with banner-making workshops or arranging something for anti-gentrication. The opportunity of the Turner Prize, we thought the spotlight would be really useful for the things we care about.Their work includes the creation of a shebeen, adorned in banners advocating reproductive rights. The goal, according to the group, was to create “a place to gather outside the sectarian ides.Ms Campbell said: The canopy in the shebeen is made up of actual protest banners that we#ve used. It is now on full display at the official prize exhibition at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.It was a strong year for collectives, with four other artist groups - Black Obsidian Sound System, Cooking Sections, Gentle Radical, and Project Art Works - also up for the award, the first time that the pool of nominees was made up of entirely of collectives.The judges decided this year to only shortlist collectives because of the times we#re in, said Ms Campbell. A lot of people needed to be in a collective to be able to sustain an artistic practice. Last night, they said the collectives were chosen because of the artistic work we continued to do throughout lockdown, uplting the communities we#re involved in. Collective practice has always happened in art but large institutions tend to shy away from it because it makes things more complex.The form of a collective is so necessary because it allows some people to step back when needed, such as two of the members who have recently had new babies, said Ms Campbell. It also helps people from working class backgrounds continue to work in the sector.The precarious nature of that sector means they will soon have to move on from their studio space, which they found out shortly after being nominated for the prize. We found out just after we nominated that we#ve only got another  months before ours get turned into some sort of developer#s offices or something like that.We#ve been there for decades now, so it will be sad to leave the building but Dublin is exactly the same. People get moved around quickly and there#s not enough residential housing, never mind artists studios, she said.Ms Campbell added: We#re a collective that does a lot of protest and rally work, so it#s important for us to be in the centre of Belfast because sometimes you don#t hear about a protest until a couple of hours beforehand.After the win was announced, SDLP MP Claire Hanna said Array Collective#s achievement shows the importance of supporting local artists.She called on the Department for Communities to explore further funding opportunities for the arts, to allow local talents to thrive and reach their full potential.Ms Hanna said: Unfortunately the sector is chronically underfunded, the lowest levels on this island, pushing many people out of the sector and leaving others exhausted by chasing small amounts of funding. The pandemic, and the loss of audiences, has compounded existing problems.Ms Campbell said as a collective, they are aware the Department for Communities has had real dficulty funding the arts directly.Things that are called cultural get funded that maybe shouldn#t be funded. We#re political in the sense that we try to act against those things. We#ve managed to survive despite this real lack of funding but it#s really tiring and exhausting to always have to sustain yourselves, she said.We#ve all got at least one or two jobs. There#s no way you could sustain yourself as an artist just through that work. Most of us work in the community or voluntary sector or in arts and heritage, all famously not very well paid.Judges of the Turner Prize praised the group for addressing social and political issues in Northern Ireland, and for translating their activism into artwork.Array Collective#s group is contextual, said Ms Campbell. It#s about us being from Belfast and existing in Belfast, it has eleven members and not everyone is from the north – and we’ve all worked abroad as well - but everybody has made Northern Ireland their home. We all bring a bit of a fresh perspective but we have a complex love story with Belfast.”The Department for Communities has been asked for a response. Related topicsDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Department for Communities PremiumMinister to ask Stormont to stump up more money for troubled Casement Park projectPublic is asked for its views on £m Queen’s Quay proposal PremiumStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home message PremiumPIP firm Capita to be paid over £m after contract extension PremiumHundreds waiting over two years for Personal Independence Payment appeal hearingMost ReadNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time school‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’NI school funds ‘used inappropriately’ and teachers unhappy over ‘culture of fear’Thomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlySuspended Mid and East Antrim chief Anne Donaghy to take legal action against councilTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere Latest Northern Ireland‘I was victim of vile homophobic slurs ...and the Irish FA did nothing about it’Rory McIlroy flies out of traps to share lead in the BahamasSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike actionTUV Lagan Valley candidate Dr William Kitchen considering legal action over Twitter postCovid- certicate scheme: lateral flow results must be registered on official government systemLatestThree parties claim ‘massive’ result at Old Bexley and Sidcup by-electionTories hold Old Bexley and Sidcup with reduced majority on low turnoutAlec Baldwin: I do not care about my career any more after fatal shooting on set‘Wicked’ stepmother and ‘pitiless’ father to be sentenced over Arthur’s killingEd Sheeran and Elton John face tough opposition in race for Christmas number one,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities. All the charities help those that need it most including refugees, children, older people and animals. The Christmas Challenge was launched in  by Sir Alec Reed, founder of Reed Recruitment. Last year, the campaign raised pound.m for  charities.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . -- related_article   n n  n n nAs Daniel ODonnells th birthday approaches he considers winding down a little n n n n n\".

Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Kevin Morrison - Event Images.Reporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Alan Reynolds has been unveiled as Derry City’s new Assistant Manager. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old had been at Shelbourne last season, splitting his time between there and the FAI where his Development role included assisting the national under- side. Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Pic by Kevin Morrison - Event Images.Reporter: Gary Ferry Dec Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Alan Reynolds has been unveiled as Derry City’s new Assistant Manager. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old had been at Shelbourne last season, splitting his time between there and the FAI where his Development role included assisting the national under- side. Reynolds had a previous spell at the club back in - under Stephen Kenny and he admitted he felt he had unfinished business at the Brandywell. “I’m not sureI ever thought I would arrive back here but it is a club I have a good affinity with,” he said. “I really enjoyed my spell here in  and . At times I felt like it was unfinished business that I would end up here at some stage because of the relationship I had with some of the people up here. I’m delighted to be here, it’s a new challenge and there’s a lot expected from us, but we’ll embrace that and enjoy it.” City boss Ruaidhri Higgins took his time deciding on his number two and feels he has now got the right man for the job. “Alan is a fantastic coach and it is important for me to have someone of his quality and experience here,” he stated. “He knows the league inside out and will have the trust of the players, which is key. He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  This year is the th centenary of Partition with this week in particular marking the centenary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish TreatyLocal NewsGround shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Seanie McIntosh’s attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging closer  ","story":"DETAILS of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised, it has emerged.Dunleath Park is being lined up to host the event and while no date has been confirmed, it is hoped that it will take place next year after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to provide financial support to organisers.The exact level of local authority support is currently being finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council officials asked to investigate the potential for this particular investment to happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 5%2C 2001

unveiled a number of buildings at High Street which have been transformed in the project which was funded by the local group and the International Fund for Ireland.Killyleagh Development Association chairman Professor Bob Elwood officially received the keys for the buildings from developer Maurice Crawford during a ceremony on Friday afternoon.Professor Elwood confirmed that both apartments in the scheme had already been let, while a cottage at the top of the street had been sold.Four shop units are also available and Professor Elwood said the association was in negotiations with business people about potential projects.ldquoIt was essential that this area was refurbished and renewed in an effort to bring new businesses and new people to the town, he said.ldquoAlthough these buildings are new, they have been designed to blend in with the rest of the street which is Georgian in style.Former Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne said he was proud to have been invited to open the new facility.ldquoOut of all the people that could have been asked to this, I find it was great honour that the community has given me the opportunity to perform this , he said.ldquoYou only have to go back to the beginning of the year to know that this area was an eyesore and to see it now I can hardly believe the transformation that has taken place.DOWNPATRICK ndash One of Downpatrickrsquos oldest bars is in line for a major improvement scheme which could top the pound, mark.Rearsquos Hotel in Lower Market Street has been bought by two local businessmen who plan to turn the property into one of the districtrsquos top entertainment attractions.The plans, which include a major refurbishment programme, will transform the current building which in its heyday was at the centre of attraction in the town centre.Brothers Mark and Bartley Murphy are confident the major investment will result in premises on a par with the very best Belfast has to offer and say the venture will be successful.Once the refurbishment programme has been completed, Rearsquos will serve food all day and there will also be aroom which will be hired for private parties and other similar s.ldquoThe aim is to provide a facility which willbe high class and top-of-the-range and the level of investment reflects this, said Mr MarkMurphy.ldquoThe premises have been bought and work to transform them could start early in the New Year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Lions Club have recruited the help of high school students in the town to launch their annual Christmas food appeal on behalf of the needy.Pupils from Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos were on hand recently to back Lions Club president Eddie Russellrsquos appeal for pub lic support for this important service to the community.This weekend, members of the Lions Club and their supporters will be on duty at shops and supermarkets in the area asking local people to contribute to the appeal.Mr Russell said the Lions Club is inviting shoppers to purchase one or more items of non-perishable food and place it in the trolley or basket provided.ldquoAt the end of the collection, the Lions will sort out the food into hampers for the needy and these will be distributed in time for the festive season, he said.ldquoThe Lions believe that at this time of year, many people in the community are anxious to support those who are perhaps not quite as well off as themselves and this project is an ideal way of doing so.SPA ndash A Spa musician is preparing to launch her first CD. Isabel Keenan will publicly unveil lsquoGo in Peacersquo, a compilation of sacred music, at a special event in the Arnold Hall, Spa, on Friday, December , at pm.The guest artists at the special concert will be Crawford Bell and Ivan Black.

It was events there  years ago that led effectively to the foundation of the Free Presbyterian Church.A dispute concerning the attendance of the Rev Ian Paisley at a gospel meeting resulted in a number of leading members of Lissara Presbyterian Church breaking away to form a new congregation.On March , , Crossgar Free Presbyterian Church held its first service in the Killyleagh Street Mission Hall.

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13261543.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hence it is that effective opposition to the protocol is severely compromised because the DUP are not willing to sacrice their idol in defence of the Union.

They are as void of meaning as Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” and Nigel Dodds’ “precious Union”. The stark reality for unionism is that the DUP are as much an obstacle to the removal of the protocol as are the EU and pan nationalism.If as unionists we really want to remove the protocol I suggest we must first begin by voting the DUP out of office.

Well maybe, but not as low as % which is now the accepted benchmark for making cataclysmic constitutional change. Still, % must be worrying for advocates of Irish unity.One of the consequences of a  years of partition is that most southerners don’t really know people from the north. And we don’t know them very well either. If Taoiseach Micheal Martin arrived at the average house in Northern Ireland he probably wouldn’t be recognised. It’s far more likely that he would be mistaken for someone who wanted to tarmac your driveway.Give anti-vaxxers the wrong treatment. For a broken leg prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest albumSo this poll is a real opportunity for unionism.Let’s face it Ulster Protestants have an, often unfair, reputation for being ... how can I put this politely ...dour, sour-baked, stubborn, thran, carnaptious and frankly unpleasant. This is a real asset to be exploited.So here’s my advice to unionists. Forget about trying to make Northern Ireland work, , instead concentrate on making yourselves so thoroughly obnoxious and unattractive as to ensure a landslide No vote down south. Unionists should immediately launch a campaign to put southerners off a United Ireland. We could call it “Operation You Couldn’t Like Us”This, of course, is where Jim Allister would really come in to his own. Exposing Jim to a southern audience and letting him just be himself is bound to enrage and alienate anyone who sees him. He should set up a southern branch of the TUV and run for the Dail and get on RTE as much as possible. But don’t stop there. Unionists should go on special missions down south with instructions to annoy as many people as possible. Firstly, every time you meet a southerner make sure to always call the south “Eire”. It really winds them up. Deliberately mispronounce Taoiseach and Tanaiste – to be fair unionists are already great at doing this — and always remember to roll your eyes and sigh when anyone speaks Irish.Keep reminding southerners that a British team won the All-Ireland this year. Also keep asking southerners what the All-Ireland is. Drop in to Aras an Uachtarain*and demand to know where the Deputy First President’s Office is.Send Stephen Nolan on a  county live tour and let people stare in amazement as he claims to be the “biggest show in the country”. “Country  The  Counties is a country  ”Or best of all just drive a big bus all around the south with a slogan written on the side of it: “Britain gives Northern Ireland £ billion a year. How much are you willing to pay ”That’s the Union safe for another  years. You can thank me later.• I would give anti-vaxxers medical treatment – the wrong treatmentHow has your week been Probably better than that of a North Macedonian women’s football fan. Or a Barbadian royalist. Or a council chief executive watching ‘Spotlight’. Mine was OK until I tried to watch ‘I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here’. I didn’t recognise any of the celebrities. My son said they were all Z list nobodies and were so obscure he was surprised I didn’t get the call.I didn’t let this annoy me because I’m an easy-going person, a stranger to anger. But I’m afraid to say that this week the mask-dodgers, Covid-sceptics and vaccine scaredy cats really are starting to challenge my natural equanimity.Three DUP MPs voted against mask-wearing. What have the DUP got against masks  Fair enough the Shinners have traditionally been very pro-mask. Especially in the s, s and s but that was pre-pandemic.Worst of all there was an anti-vax protest in Belfast last week during which a woman read out an anonymous letter from a ‘real’ nurse. Among the numerous ludicrous allegations in this farrago of fabrication and fakery was the claim that medical staff were being asked to lie in hospital beds and pretend to be sick with Covid. This was simultaneously hilarious and grossly offensive to hard-working NHS staff. But what can NHS staff do when faced with bare-faced liars  How do you deal with hysterical people who compare having to show a QR code on your phone to the Nazi death camps The Hippocratic Oath requires medical people to treat the ill, no matter how stupid those people are. I’m not saying that anti-vaxxers should be denied medical treatment. Of course not. I would give them medical treatment. But I would give them the wrong medical treatment. If an anti-vaxxer turns up at AE with a broken leg simply prescribe listening to Van Morrison’s latest album. It’ll take their mind off the pain. Or even better let these self-appointed medical experts treat each other. Anti-vaxxers should play Russian Roulette with their own health the same way they do with ours. Let Piers Corbyn do Paul Frew’s ingrown toenail. Let Paddy Barnes have a go at an appendectomy. After all they’ve all done their “own research”. How hard can it be  The Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Traditionreport has been published, after a long delay.Setting up such a commission was the right thing to do. If Northern Ireland is to be a harmonious, stable society in which people across the community can feel respected in their identity and cultural affiliations, then the very least we can do is try to navigate a way through these thorny topics.The report is  pages long so will take some time to absorb. That it has been able to make  recommendations given the breadth of its commissioner baseis progress of sorts.But on core topics such as flying flags from lamposts and public buildings, on terrorist memorials, and on the handling of bonfires there is no agreement.That Declan Kearney, the chairman of Sinn Fein, is calling for an “orderly implementation” of the proposals hardly gives cause for optimism about the likely fate of the report.While the approach of republicans towards, for example, the Northern Ireland centenary has been depressingly intransigent, in a way it has helped to clary things. There is no generosity and there seems to be little prospect of generosity.Disgracefully, Northern Ireland has not been allowed to celebrate its th birthday — we have not even been allowed to be marked at Stormont with a centenary stone. Not even a church service of celebration of our wonderful country .What chance is there of wider agreement And what prospect is there of consensus on bonfires given that Sinn Fein and the SDLP over the summer took to the courts to try to force a resolution to a contested bonfire in north Belfast  Or when there are efforts to float the idea of two national flags flying on public buildings in NI, which would be a symbolic undermining of UK sovereignty and the consent principle ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
