Photograph: Tom HonanDún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is facing a Government intervention over its contentious move to block new homes being built in the south Dublin suburbs of Killiney and Dalkey, as a row intensifies over the future of some of the most valuable lands in the State.Planning regulators objected to the ban, arguing it was “an unnecessary restriction” on sustainable development. But councillors refused to remove the measure from their 2022-28 development plan, in defiance of the regulator’s statutory recommendations to overturn it. Now regulator Niall Cussen has asked Minister of State for local government Peter Burke to issue formal directions to the council compelling it to take action over breaches of such recommendations. The development plan says “significant parts” of Dalkey and Killiney are characterised by low density development, adding that “no increase in the number of residential buildings will normally be permitted” in some areas. In correspondence to the Minister late last week, Mr Cussen has also asked him to issue directions over new restrictions on buy-to-let apartments in the development plan. The regulator opposed measures that require three-bedroom apartments to be built in 40 per cent of the units in build-to-rent schemes in “new residential communities”.Mr Burke is understood to be preparing to issue draft directions on both counts in coming days, meaning the matter will go back to the council. That move essentially means the council will have to reopen the development plan it adopted last month, after 18 months of debate.The Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) was established in 2019 to provide independent oversight of the planning process. One of its functions is to assess development plans to ensure they properly apply national policies.City and county councils around the State are in the process of adopting a new wave of development plans, which sets the framework for housing and other developments for the rest of the decade.Mr Cussen’s call for a ministerial direction in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown plan is his sixth. He previously asked the Minister to intervene in the plans of Cork County Council and the councils in Kilkenny, Laois, Meath and Westmeath. Asked about the regulator’s decision on its plan, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council said any notification seeking a ministerial direction goes to the Minister and not it as the planning authority. “The Minister then has two weeks in which to issue notice of any intention to issue a direction to the planning authority. That further two-week period has not yet passed,” the council said.The regulator’s office had no comment on its decision, which follows a four-week review of the development plan. Any ministerial direction “commences a process by the local authority, including public consultation, after which the OPR further considers the matter with a view to recommending, or not, that the Minister issue a final direction” on the plan.“The OPR works proactively with local authorities in the deliberations on their plans to ensure the best outcomes for communities which are consistent with regional and national planning policies.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"jim wells resigns from dup after 46 years","story":"Jim Wells poses in election photographs with TUV candidate Harold McKee and TUV leader Jim Allister. Photograph: TUVPA WireVeteran DUP representative Jim Wells has resigned from the party after 46 years.Mr Wells, a former health minister, told the BBC Nolan Show he could not support the Democratic Unionist Party’s candidate in South Down for the Assembly elections, Diane Forsythe. Mr Wells instead declared his support for a candidate from the rival Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) in the Stormont elections.He said: “I have decided I cannot support the candidate that the party executive has imposed on the people of South Down and I have resigned from the party.“I think that the moment I said that I would not be backing the candidate that was imposed upon us, it was inevitable.“I took the decision late last night to contact the party leader, the party secretary and the chief executive and let them know that after 46 years I have gone as a DUP member.“I feel very strongly about this.”Mr Wells, who has been the DUP’s Assembly representative in South Down since 1998, has called on voters to give their first preference to Harold McKee of the TUV on May 5th.The DUP responded by stating the election was about more than “mere personalities”.Mr Wells found out earlier this year he had not been selected as the party’s candidate for the South Down constituency after Ms Forsythe was chosen as the candidate.Mr Wells had been vocal in his opposition to Ms Forsythe as the candidate, and instead backed a failed bid by former DUP leader Edwin Poots to become the party’s candidate in the area.He has posed in election photographs with Mr McKee and TUV leader Jim Allister. ‘Core principles’Mr Wells said: “As I leave the Assembly it is my earnest desire that South Down should continue to have a Unionist MLA whose politics are grounded in conviction and principle.“Among the candidates Harold McKee is the stand-out candidate with these credentials.“He holds dear many of the core principles that I upheld in Stormont and is widely and properly respected as a politician of conviction, not expediency.“Accordingly, I recommend him to those who faithfully supported me at the polls over the years and urge them to vote McKee 1.”Mr McKee said Mr Wells had been “abandoned by his own party”.He added: “I am delighted to have his support and gratified that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “At critical times in Stormont, Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”A DUP spokesperson said: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether NI goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in 2017.“She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.” – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"An Irishman and a local joined forces to build a surfing community at the beach in Bureh\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"frances populist revolt coming","story":"What did they mean by that? The French public has delivered a first-round result in their presidential election that leaves political nerds unable to reach a consensus about where events are likely to go from here.On the one hand, a four-point margin for the incumbent Emmanuel Macron over Marine Le Pen was bigger than some polls had predicted. The Western world’s “centrist dad” brigade might have been inclined to breathe a sigh of relief and claim there is no discernible path to victory for Madame Le Pen in the second-round run-off in a fortnight’s time.But the centrist dads have been wrong before – about Brexit, about Donald Trump and about Britain’s 2019 general election, to cite just a few recent examples. There is at least as strong a case for looking at yesterday’s result and concluding that the establishment-minded centre cannot hold and that it is now not a question of whether there will be a populist Right takeover of the apparatus of government in France, but merely of when.For a start, there is a simple comparison to be made with the first-round vote of five years ago. Back then the charismatic insurgent Macron won 24 per cent, to Le Pen’s 21 per cent. Half a decade has added an unspectacular two or three percentage points to the vote shares of both and the same to Jean-Luc Melenchon, the far-Left populist who scored 19.5 per cent five years ago and 22 per cent last night.But look at what has happened to the traditional establishment parties of centre-Left and centre-Right, the Socialists and the Republicans. Five years ago the former was thought to be at its lowest possible ebb when its candidate won just six per cent, while the latter was deeply disappointed with a 20 per cent share. Last night those scores slumped to two per cent and five per cent respectively.So France is in a vigorously anti-establishment mood and it is hard to see how five years of incumbency and presidential peacocking will enable Macron to harness that as well as he did in 2017. There is a widespread feeling that he is a “president of the rich” with an entourage dominated by privileged young Parisians swanning around in made-to-measure suits and harbouring luxury liberal beliefs.Le Pen, by contrast, has sought out the populist sweet spot of being to the Right on cultural issues and to the Left on economic ones. Her campaign has taken her around the market towns of France, speaking to the common people who formed the bulk of the “Gilet Jaune” protestors and who care more about the price of petrol than the high politics of EU summits or even the suffering of Ukraine.In the first round this time, Le Pen has not only established a strong lead among working class voters but also among the young, with a radical plan to scrap income tax for the under-30s being the core of of her economic offering.Macron himself appears to understand that he will not win the run-off as a conventional capital city centrist given the current public mood and last night pledged to represent the aspirations of those who voted for Le Pen and her fellow Right populist Eric Zemmour, the bulk of whose seven per cent vote share is surely currently heading her way.The decisive factor now will be where the voters of Melenchon end up. Many despise the values of the Paris-based elites just as much as Le Pen’s supporters do and many also are firmly traditionalist on social and cultural matters. Last night Melenchon did Macron a favour by urging them not to vote for Le Pen, though he could not bring himself to endorse the French president.The next two weeks will see French elites attempt to kill Le Pen’s ambitions in the usual way – using her surname and previous leadership of the Front National against her, as well as her unwise past praise for Vladimir Putin, in a bid to persuade voters that she is simply not a respectable choice.But Macron himself seems to understand that, barring Le Pen malfunctioning disastrously again in a televised debate as she did last time, this will not be enough. During his first term Macron has tried hard to keep onboard voters who are anxious about the state of French society and has made a series of speeches about enforcing integration into the French way of life for migrant communities.If he holds on in two weeks’ time – as he is just about favourite to do – it will surely be because he remains a sufficiently canny campaigner to keep one foot in the populist camp himself rather than because the French public are gravitating back towards establishment norms.Nobody expects anything like the crushing two-to-one drubbing he gave Le Pen in the run-off last time. Even if they beat her this time, how the French establishment would fend her off again in 2027 is very difficult to see.More from NewsPolitics latest news: More than 50 Downing Street \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 fines issued, say Met PoliceRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin vows ‘clear and noble’ aims of Russian invasion will be achievedTory MPs call on Ben Goldsmith to quit after voicing support for Extinction RebellionRescuers dig for suvivors after storm Megi brings landslides to PhilippinesBan export of UK\u0026#39s rubbish overseas, says Environment Agency chiefSocial media to be considered suicide risk factor for first timeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery highlights male gaze manet masterpiece woke attempt","story":"The “male gaze” in a Manet masterpiece has been highlighted by the Courtauld Gallery after curators introduced new labels addressing “misogyny” in art.The London gallery, which holds the UK’s foremost Impressionist collection, reviewed the labelling of all of its paintings as part of a three-year, £57 million refurbishment. Some information panels now address issues like artists’ racism and sexism.Manet\u0027s masterpiece, A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, has been reinterpreted with a new label which suggests that the painting has an “unsettling” quality, because of the presence of a man on the canvas.The 1882 work depicts a barmaid staring out at the viewer of the painting and - in a mirrored image - towards a male patron of the eponymous Folies-Bergère (a Parisian cabaret club) who returns her gaze.The female subject’s “enigmatic expression is unsettling”, a new information panel states, “especially as she appears to be interacting with a male customer”.The suggestion that an “unsettling” quality of the painting is enhanced because the woman talking to a man has been criticised for unwitting “misogyny”, because it diminishes the position of the female model in the work.Ruth Millington, a historian whose book Muse chronicles the female inspirations for great art, said: “It completely shifts the viewer’s attention away from her and onto the man in the picture.“This interpretation, in a woke attempt to call out misogyny, unwittingly centres the male gaze. The writer implies that the woman is unsettled by the man’s presence, framing her as a passive victim of her circumstances.“Curators must stop trapping female muses and models with male-centred interpretations such as this.“In a painting of multiple gazes, it’s unfair and misogynistic to emphasise the male perspective. I’d rather read a fresh new label which invites viewers to imagine what the woman is thinking.”The model Manet used for the painting was a real-life woman called Suzon who worked at the Folies-Bergère, a venue frequented where prostitutes plied their trade, and it has been suggested that a subtext of the painting is the exploited barmaid’s availability to male customers, along with the alcohol she is selling.The Courtauld holds the UK’s leading collection of Gauguin works, but the French painter known for his time in Tahitian subjects - and teenage brides -  has now been reappraised by curators for “taking advantage of his position as a European coloniser”.A label on his Post-Impressionist work Nevermore states the painting depicts “one of several teenagers that he took on as ‘wives’”, adding that “the widespread racist fantasy of Tahitian girls as sexually precocious led to their unabashed exploitation”.An information panel for his 1897 painting Te Rerioa now informs visitors that its subject matter was intended to “appeal to a white European audience” by “exoticising” Polynesians.Further information on Gauguin’s memoir Avant et Apres - recently acquired by the Courtauld - states that the 213-page manuscript is “peppered with examples of his own racism and misogyny”.The treatment of other cultures as “primitive” has also been addressed in a new label for the self-portrait of Roger Fry, the Bloomsbury group painter, known for his advancement of Gauguin-inspired “Primitivism” in Western art.Updated information on the portrait states: “For modernist artists and writers, African art belonged to an earlier stage of civilisation known as “primitivism ““This reveals the reactive ideas of the time, which underpinned even the views of progressives like Fry.”The Courtauld’s relabelling comes following widespread reassessment of problematic artists, with the Picasso Museum in Paris recently inviting artists to critique the painter’s personal life, and the National Gallery highlighting Gauguin’s sexual proclivities in a 2019 show.Manet has also faced reappraisal over works like Olympia, a bold nude that scandalised the Paris Salon in 1865, and which has invited more recent criticism at the Musée d’Orsay for its sidelining of a black woman in the painting.The Courtauld has been contacted for comment.More from NewsPolitics latest news: More than 50 Downing Street \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 fines issued, say Met PoliceRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin vows ‘clear and noble’ aims of Russian invasion will be achievedTory MPs call on Ben Goldsmith to quit after voicing support for Extinction RebellionRescuers dig for suvivors after storm Megi brings landslides to PhilippinesBan export of UK\u0026#39s rubbish overseas, says Environment Agency chiefSocial media to be considered suicide risk factor for first timeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britons facing 12 months travel delays due staff shortages","story":"Travellers are facing up to 12 months of delays at Britain’s airports and ports as the travel industry struggles to recruit enough people to fill vacancies, industry experts have warned.Kully Sandhu, the managing director of the Aviation Recruitment Network, told the BBC’s Today Programme that it will take “at least the next 12 months for the industry, vacancy wise, to settle down.”Thousands of people heading abroad for the Easter holidays have been warned they face long queues, delays and cancellations.Manchester Airport, along with others, has warned that long waits at security could continue as it struggles with staff shortages, with some passengers facing queues of 60 to 90 minutes over the next few weeks.Industry leaders have said the lack of staff is the primary cause of the issue, the both the pandemic and Brexit leading to a shortage of workers.“Brexit has not helped because we had a natural attraction of iniduals from the European market who would apply for vacancies in UK airports. We no longer have that talent pool, and we are relying on iniduals in the UK,” Mr Sandhu told the BBC. “It makes it very difficult for recruiters to recruit these iniduals because we are all fighting for the same type of candidates.”Those returning to the UK this week will also face the misery of long queues as Border Force have warned they too have a lack of staff available to check inbound passengers.Lucy Moreton, the General Secretary of the Immigration Services Union, told the BBC that the agency was struggling with a chronic shortage of officers.“For the first time in living memory, Border Force isn’t attracting the number of candidates to fill the vacancies they’ve got,” she said.Ms Moreton warned that this, combined with the particularly large numbers of people travelling over the school holidays, would mean “the queues will move from security based outbound, to Border Force based coming in.”Last month, Heathrow Airport recorded its busiest month since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with 4.2 million passengers passing through the terminal, an eight-fold increase from the same month in 2021. That figure is expected to rise again this month owing to the Easter holidays as well as the government’s removal of all pandemic-era travel restrictions.However, both Mr Sandhu and Ms Moreton rejected calls for security checks to be loosened during the hiring process, saying the checks were vital to protect the UK’s national security.“You don’t expect your police officer to be incompletely trained or not security cleared and we certainly wouldn’t want anything else for Border Force.” “More resources would enable those checks to get through quicker, but we can’t cut corners on the training so we are looking at a very difficult summer.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin vows ‘clear and noble’ aims of Russian invasion will be achievedPolitics latest news: More than 50 Downing Street \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 fines issued, say Met PoliceTory MPs call on Ben Goldsmith to quit after voicing support for Extinction RebellionRescuers dig for suvivors after storm Megi brings landslides to PhilippinesBan export of UK\u0026#39s rubbish overseas, says Environment Agency chiefSocial media to be considered suicide risk factor for first timeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"comes next imran khan","story":"On Sunday evening, as dusk fell and the Ramadan fast ended, the streets of Pakistan’s cities filled with people waving flags bearing the red and green logo of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the party founded by Imran Khan. From Karachi to Lahore, Islamabad to Peshawar – and even in Hyde Park in London – tens of thousands took to the streets to protest the ousting of 69-year-old Khan, the prime minister, after four years in government. Dismissed in the early hours of Sunday, after losing a no-confidence vote in parliament, he is to be replaced as prime minister by Shahbaz Sharif, a politician from the opposition alliance.  But the former international sportsman has not gone gently. Instead, Khan has fought tooth and nail to prevent the vote from going ahead, insisting that he was the victim of a US plot. Last week, moreover, he attempted to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections, a move Pakistan’s Supreme Court declared unconstitutional.  “Part of the issue at play is Khan’s competitive streak,” says Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia programme at the Washington-based Wilson Center. “He’s retained a win-at-all-costs mentality from his cricket days, and in the political sphere this translates to holding on to power as long as he can.”It is the latest chapter in an extraordinary political journey for a man who first came to fame as a cricket star and socialite, but transformed into a populist firebrand who rails against western decadence, panders to the conservative religious lobby, and jails political opponents. Like Donald Trump, he was a celebrity before he was a politician, and like Trump, he has relied on the politics of grievance to gain mass appeal.Khan began his international cricket career at the age of 18 in a 1971 Test series against England, and in 1992 he led Pakistan’s team to a glorious victory in the World Cup. Strikingly handsome, he studied at Oxford, and became a fixture in London’s aristocratic social scene. He was friends with Princess Diana and Mark Shand, the brother of Camilla Parker Bowles, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s was regularly snapped by paparazzi on nights out at Annabelle’s and Tramp.Although he rejected the labels of ‘playboy’ or ‘sex symbol’ in interviews, he was linked with a string of famous women. One iconic photograph showed Khan in a dressing gown in his Chelsea bedroom, with gold tigers adorning the wall behind him. And in his 2009 biography of Khan, Christopher Sandford writes: “Imran may not have been the first player to enjoy his own cult following, but he was more or less singlehandedly responsible for sexualising what had hitherto been an austere, male-oriented activity.”That phase culminated in 1995, when at the age of 43, Khan married 21-year-old Jemima Goldsmith, the daughter of tycoon Jimmy Goldsmith, cementing his place in London’s high society.Then in 1996 – perhaps inspired in part by his new father-in-law who had just established the Referendum Party – Khan founded Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), which translates to the Movement for Justice. In its first election, the PTI did not win a single seat, and Khan was broadly seen as a joke candidate. He was memorably described by opponents as “Im the Dim”.Undeterred, Khan kept at it, and at the next election, he won a single seat – his own.Despite the early mockery, that lack of political acumen was ultimately a strength. Khan wasn’t coming to politics to make money or a name for himself, explains journalist Aatish Taseer, who has written extensively on Khan. “In a country used to mercenary politicians, this was refreshing.”It was not until the 2013 election campaign that Khan really began to gather mass support, drawing tens of thousands of people to rallies across the country. Appealing primarily to the young, urban middle class – a broadly conservative demographic in Pakistan – Khan pledged to end corruption in 90 days and to create 10 million jobs. It was an appealing message in a country hamstrung by dynastic politics, corruption and a stalling economy. “He’s a non-politician politician, so he appeals to people who are normally not drawn into politics – a huge constituency,” says Karachi-based writer Mohammed Hanif. “His message is a mixture of defiance to the traditional power elite and reminders of his glamorous past. Being his follower is like hanging out with a celebrity who lectures you on the meaning of life.”During his years in politics, Khan moved away from his womanising past and publicly embraced Islam, to the extent that his critics found a new nickname: “Taliban Khan”. (Among other things, he advocated for negotiations with the Pakistani Taliban, responsible for tens of thousands of deaths in the country, and opposed a series of women’s rights bills.)Some commentators in Pakistan have noted that Khan’s three marriages illustrate that move towards conservatism. In 2004, he and Jemima Goldsmith announced their orce during the nine-year marriage, they had had two sons, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim. (An earlier relationship with heiress Sita White resulted in a daughter, Tyrian.) In 2015, he announced his marriage to British-Pakistani newsreader Reham Khan. The marriage ended acrimoniously the following year. And in 2018, six months before the election that year, Khan married his spiritual healer and mentor Bushra Bibi. She wears a full face-veil, and Khan told reporters that he had never seen her face before their marriage. Yet alongside this shift, and his rousing public criticisms of the west, Khan continued to stay with the Goldsmiths at their west London home on his regular trips to the UK, where his two sons still live.This transformation – from sex symbol to pious Muslim – is just one of many for this political shapeshifter. “He switches between selves as one would switch between languages,” says Taseer. “He never sought inner cohesion. He treated the West as nothing but the source of debased worldly pleasures, in which he occasionally partook, and turned the East into an unassailable beacon of piety. Since neither picture is completely true, it produced an almost willful schizophrenia in him. He lived out his contradictions, but never acknowledged them.”In the 2018 election, the PTI won a wafer-thin majority and Khan became prime minister. The military has ruled Pakistan for roughly half of its 75 years, and even during periods of civilian government, it plays an outsize role in public life. In opposition, Khan criticised the generals for meddling in politics, but his victory in 2018 was attributed broadly to military patronage, and during his tenure the army expanded its role in government. It was another transformation, this time from avowed political outsider to military favourite.Although the victory was the culmination of two decades of political struggle, Khan’s performance in government was lacklustre, characterised by policy U-turns and a worsening climate of partisanship and censorship in which scores of journalists and political activists were jailed. “He never stopped being an opposition leader when he became prime minister. He refused to reach across the aisle,” says Kugelman. “He didn’t make compromises and concessions. Instead, he used maximalist rhetoric and labelled his rivals and those that disagreed with him as traitors and thieves. He injected more toxicity into a political environment already heavy with the poison of polarisation.”Pakistan is mired in an economic crisis inherited from the previous government and exacerbated by global issues such as rising energy costs and supply-chain problems. Although the problems are not entirely of Khan’s making, his handling of the economy has been chaotic, losing him public support. Additionally, his relationship with the all-powerful military soured last year after a dispute over the appointment of the next spy chief. Sensing a window of opportunity, opposition parties united to call a vote of no-confidence.Khan’s ousting puts him in good company: in the tumultuous context of Pakistan, no prime minister has ever completed their term. And it is clear that Khan plans to fight on. On Sunday, in his first comments since losing the vote, Khan tweeted: “Pakistan became an independent state in 1947, but the freedom struggle begins again today against a foreign conspiracy of regime change.

This stretch of river is a regularly used and treasured place for hundreds of people - families, swimmers, kayakers, rowers, anglers, birdwatchers - and a home for many other creatures, and this is the very least it deserves.“I’m looking forward to working locally with Thames Water and other partners to ensure the water quality improves, and nationally to help other groups protect their local rivers.”The East Cowes Esplanade on the Isle of Wight will be added to the list of designated bathing spots, which includes coastal waters. MPs have called for water companies to ensure that at least one stretch of river in each of their areas is monitored by 2025.Polling for The  earlier this year found that more than 80 per cent of people expect to be able to safely swim in a local river, despite officials from the Environment Agency insisting they are not intended for human use.“While bathing water quality has improved in recent years and England now has the cleanest bathing waters since records began, we know that water quality at these sites won’t change overnight. “It will take time and all those with a role to play must commit to achieve the necessary improvements,” said Rebecca Pow, Environment Minister.“We are continuing to drive up the quality of lakes, rivers and seas for the public to enjoy through the measures in our Environment Act, and I would encourage more applications for popular bathing areas, both inland and coastal, that may also be suitable for designation.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Vladimir Putin vows ‘clear and noble’ aims of Russian invasion will be achievedPolitics latest news: More than 50 Downing Street \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 fines issued, say Met PoliceTory MPs call on Ben Goldsmith to quit after voicing support for Extinction RebellionRescuers dig for suvivors after storm Megi brings landslides to PhilippinesBan export of UK\u0026#39s rubbish overseas, says Environment Agency chiefSocial media to be considered suicide risk factor for first timeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"5 questions rishi sunak must","story":" questions Rishi Sunak must answer as he demands probe into his own conductMr Sunaks family finances have been in the spotlight since it emerged his we Akshata Murty had non-domicile tax status, allowing her to legally avoid paying UK taxes on overseas incomethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video rishi-sunak-faces-whole-list-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:XFaEYxXv,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Downing Street confirmed that Boris Johnson had ordered his ethics adviser Lord Geidt to probe the Chancelloraposs conduct after a request from Mr Sunak himself.Mr Sunakaposs family finances have been in the spotlight after it emerged that his we Akshata Murty had non-domicile tax status, allowing her to legally avoid paying UK taxes on overseas income. She U-turned on Friday to save her husbandaposs job by vowing to pay UK tax on herforeign income, which includes an estimated £. million-a-year in shares from the Indian IT giant Infosys - founded by her billionaire father Narayana Murty. Mr Sunak attempted to defuse the row by asking Lord Geidt to investigate, as he said he was confident he had declared everything properly. The Prime Ministeraposs deputy spokeswoman said: Iaposm not aware of whether Lord Geidt himself has begun his work. But I can confirm that the Prime Minister has agreed to the request from the Chancellor for Lord Geidt to undertake this work. Here are some of the questions the Chancellor needs to clear up. How much has his we saved in UK tax through non-dom status  Mr Sunakaposs nightmare week began when it emerged that his we held non-dom status, potentially saving her millions of pounds in tax. The arrangement, which is legal, allows people who are domiciled abroad to avoid paying UK tax on their overseas income. Her spokeswoman initially tried to claim it was because she was an Indian citizen but she then admitted that Ms Murty paid the British Government £,-a-year to keep the status.Ms Murty was forced to into a U-turn on Friday and said she would now pay UK tax on her foreign income. This includes a .% stake in Indian IT giant Infosys, founded by her billionaire father Naranya Murty. Her share is worth an estimated £ million and provides around £. million in idends per year. Under non-dom rules, Ms Murty was not obliged to pay UK tax on this income - and it is unclear how big her tax bill could have been.The BBC estimated she would have saved £. million in UK tax based on these figures.Ms Murty remains domiciled in India where she eventually wants to . What did Rishi Sunak declare about it  Mr Sunak is understood to have declared his weaposs tax status to the Cabinet Office when he first became a minister in . Sources said the Treasury was also aware, so as to manage any potential conflicts of interest. However, what happened after he made the declaration is not clear, because her status is not on his public declaration of ministerial interests.  Mr Sunak has asked for Lord Geidt to review all his declarations of interest since he became a minister in  to ensure they had been properly stated. He said he was confident he had acted appropriately at all times, but his overriding concern was that the public should have confidence in the answers. Guidance to ministers says the list is not an account of all the interests or financial arrangements held by a Minister or members of their close family, adding: Rather it is a list of any such interests, which are, or might reasonably be perceived to be, directly relevant to that particular minister’s public duties. Why did he hold a US green card until last year  Mr Sunak confirmed on Friday that he held a US green card for more than a year while he was Chancellor. A spokeswoman said he sought guidance ahead of his first US trip in a Government capacity in October - despite taking on the top Treasury job in February . People with green cards are treated as lawful permanent residents by US tax authorities, and it is seen as a step towards full citizenship.  Mr Sunakaposs spokeswoman said he filed US tax s, but specically as a non-resident, in full compliance with the law. The Sunaks met at Stanford University and worked in the US before moving to the UK to pursue Mr Sunakaposs political career. They are understood to have a holiday home in Calornia.At a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said he was unaware of Mr Sunak holding a US green card, but stressed that the Chancellor had done absolutely everything he was required to do. Is he a beneficiary in tax havens  The Independent reported on Friday that Mr Sunak was listed as the beneficiary of trusts set up in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands to help manage the tax and business affairs of Ms Murtyaposs family interests. But a spokeswoman close to the Sunak family said: No-one in Akshataaposs family is aware of this alleged trust. Labour called on Mr Sunak to explain the situation.Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: We need full disclosure now. Has he broken the ministerial code  Labour has accused the Chancellor of breaking the ministerial code, the set of guidelines that top politicians must follow.It states that outside interests must be reported to the Permanent Secretary of their department. It is understood Mr Sunak did report his weaposs status to the Cabinet Office and the Treasury was also aware. The ministerial code says the register of interests should also cover interests of the ministeraposs spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. Lord Geidt will examine this as part of his investigation. Politicians who break the ministerial code are traditionally expected to resign.

Fishy Rishi is a beached Chancellor without credibility, struggling to survive and contemplating resignation over the Rishi Notax scandal. The nets trawling the sordid financial affairs of his incredibly wealthy family may yet produce another jaw-dropper that will force the Tory moneybags to resign in disgrace. And the morally corrupt Prime Minister he’s now unlikely ever to succeed – charlatan Boris Johnson, who presided over widespread law-breaking during Covid, his head on the chopping block until Putin spared him – remains a rotten man. Downing Street’s decaying neighbours represent a Conservative government decomposing rapidly, with ministers mocked for regurgitating on the airwaves pathetic excuses for indefensible behaviour.  Draw a Venn diagram and the fools spouting drivel to shield slippery Sunak and an heiress we, Akshata Murty, who’d pay £, to avoid millions of pounds in British tax, overlap with idiots who ly claimed Johnson didn’t hold parties and is innocent of all charges. Whether what non-dom Murty and Green Card Sunak did was legal misses the point that it is unacceptable for a Chancellor to put up taxes for the little people while his family lawfully dodge them. Sleaze taking the Tories back to the John Major era is a glorious opportunity for Labour – and a challenge. Leader Keir Starmer is receiving conflicting advice. Either he sticks with Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn’s proposals to end the non-dom scam, or he listens to those who say it would be seen as anti-business. Championing fairness could draw a thick red line between Labour and the Tories at the election. The Conservative fish is rotting... Labour needs to use its head.

Fair enough. We are all agreed that you can’t go around slapping people, even though this column remains of the opinion that we are in a weird place with so-called comedians at awards nights: Dead set against violence but prepared to normalise the kind of bullying and humiliation of iniduals at these types of events that would probably earn you a trip to HR in the workplace. Again, shame on Rock who made Smith’s we Jada the butt of his jokes because of her shaven head. It is well known she suffers from alopecia. Would she have been fair gameshe’d had breast cancer  Reading Smith’s autobiography on holiday last week , I was also struck by this in the second chapter. “When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of her head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other in my le, has defined who I am today. “Within everything that I have done since then – the awards, the accolades, the spotlights and the attention, the characters and the laughs – there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. “For failing her in that moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward.” None of that excuses his actions two weeks ago. But it does explain why he snapped on that night. His book also details a string of examples he would come to recognise as double standards in his negative treatment over the years. A furious debate is understood to have raged within the Academy’s , members in Whats App groups in the fortnight after Smith’s slap.It would be fascinating to see a Venn diagram of which members were dead set on Smith’s suspension and which ones signed a  petition calling for Polanski – who admitted raping a child four decades ago – to be released from detention in Zurich.It took  years for the Academy to take a stand over Polanski, only expelling him in . Before then he’d won a Best Director Oscar in  to a standing ovation. No statement from the Academy back then blasting his “unacceptable” and “harmful” conduct, as there was last week over Smith. Allegations over the conduct of a string of other big names, including Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and Mel Gibson have not seen any of them exiled over the last few decades either, even temporarily. But consistency doesn’t appear to be paramount in the minds of the Academy or its members – only appeasing the social media mob.

The under-fire Chancellor was accused of hiding from the cameras at Darlington College on Monday, following days of criticism after it emerged billionaire we Akshata Murty had been avoiding paying UK tax as a non-dom.It also emerged that, while advisers denied access to the BBC and other broadcasters, the Chancellor was accompanied by his £,-a-year taxpayer-funded photographer.The Tory minister denied that he was out of touch with the British public, however, and insisted he understood that many ordinary families were struggling with the high cost of living.  Reporters who were allowed in were instructed in advance not to ask about the saga threatening to derail his career in an apparent bid to avoid embarrassing the under-fire minister. During questions, Mr Sunak refused to be drawn on his billionaire weaposs tax status - or claims that he held a US green card while Chancellor - and images of a smiling Chancellor, taken by his own vanity snapper, were distributed to outlets and shared on social media. A Labour source said: “Hard-working families across the country face spiralling energy bills, rising prices at the petrol pumps and crippling Tory tax rises.  “It beggars belief that Rishi Sunak is carrying on with his taxpayer-funded vanity photoshoots without a care in the world. For this out of touch Chancellor it’s a case of ‘cost of living crisis  What cost of living crisis ’” Sources at the event also said the Chancelloraposs PR advisers tried to shield the Chancellor from dficult questions when he appeared on stage with Tory mayor for Tees Valley Ben Houchen.They said: “Usually you can’t move for cameras when the mayor has ministers in town but this time the news media seemed about as welcome as a letter from HMRC on Rishi Sunak ’s doormat.They clearly wanted maximum control as the Chancellor even chaired the . During the QA, the Treasury events team with microphones didn’t even wait for the Chancellor to point out who would ask the next question asthey had been vetted in advance. Boris Johnson has ordered his sleaze advisor to look into Mr Sunakaposs financial declarations to make sure all the rules had been followed.Mr Sunakaposs political career is at risk of being derailed by the row over his weaposs non-domiciled status and his own former holding of a US green card.  Mr Sunak also asked for all three press questions to be submitted together to avoid giving detailed answers, or the opportunity for follow-ups. But asked whether he was out of touch with the British public, the Chancellor said: On cost of living, I know itaposs dficult for people. Of course I know itaposs dficult. I want to make sure that we can do, and I can do, everything we can to get through what are some challenging months ahead. People are looking at what is happening around them and seeing prices go up and of course people are worried by that. I want them to be reassured that me and the Government are on their side and doing what we can to ease the burdens that we are facing. Yet aides have briefed that Mr Sunak ordered an aggressive Whitehall inquiry into how his weaposs tax details were leaked, rather than focusing on the cost of living crisis.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said all Cabinet ministers should declare whether they have ever used schemes like non dom status to reduce their tax.I donapost have any non doms in the shadow cabinet because I understand the fairness of the issue, he said. He called for the PM to guarantee that no other members of the Cabinet have been using these schemes to reduce their tax. I think on behalf of everybody who is now paying more tax we are entitled to an answer to that question.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has admitted he was previously a non dom for tax purposes.But No  refused to say whether the PM was taking any steps to find outany other ministers, or their spouses, have green cards or non dom status. A government spokesman said: All MPs and sitting peers are automatically deemed to be resident in the UK for tax purposes, by law. Ms Murtyaposs non dom status could have saved her an estimated £ million in taxes on idends from her shares in Infosys, an Indian IT company founded by her father.

Experts said cost of living crisis had “set in” as official figures showed regular pay tumbled .% in the three months to February, after CPI inflation. The same figure but month-to-month to February shows a drop of .%, the biggest since August , according to the Office for National Statistics . The Resolution Foundation warned there was a gulf between the public sector, where pay fell .% in real terms, and the private sector where it fell only .%. And today even Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said he was feeling the pinch - despite a pay rise on April  taking his salary to £, a year.Askedhe would publish his tax , as people are calling for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to do, he told LBC Radio: “I’ve got to be honest, my finances are pretty uncomplicated.“And like lots of people, by the th of the month, Iaposm pretty worried about my overdraft, rather than any sort of amazing tax [inaudible].”It comes days after another Tory minister on £k, Kit Malthouse, said the rise in energy prices was hitting him “very signicantly”.  Mr Heappey added despite his taxbeing very simple, he would resist calls to publish them because “I actually think MPs should be entitled to a degree of privacy.” Mr Heappey spoke less than an hour after the ONS published updated figures on weekly earnings falling behind inflation. According to the CPIH measure of inflation, preferred by the ONS, real regular pay excluding bonuses dropped % in the year to the three months ending in February. One a one month basis, the same calculation shows real regular pay dropping .% in the year to February. The same figures using CPI inflation were .% and .%. While pay rose % in the quarter, it was far outstripped by inflation. And experts warn the cost-of-living crisis will get worse as inflation is set to peak near % later this year. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the Government was helping to cushion the impacts of global price rises through over £ billion of support for the cost of living this financial year. But business groups said households and companies were already coming under strain from eye-watering price hikes. Pat McFadden, Labouraposs shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: Rishi Sunak could have chosen a one-off windfall tax on huge oil and gas company profits to cut household energy bills by up to £.  Instead, heaposs decided to make Britain the only major economy to land working people with higher taxes in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, warned: “While strong bonuses continue to mitigate the effects of rising prices on peopleaposs total earnings, basic pay is now falling noticeably in real terms. The latest ONS labour market data also revealed the unemployment rate fell further below levels seen before the pandemic struck, at .% in the three months to February, which is the lowest reading since December  and down from .% in the previous three-month period. There were , fewer jobless Britons at . million in the quarter to February, while those in employment rose , to . million. But the Resolution Foundation warned: “A buoyant labour market is not generating much wage pressure, especially once base effects from furlough are taken into account. “And with inflation soaring, Britain’s pay squeeze will continue to tighten. “The current fall in real wages is not projected to end until late , and will leave average wages no higher than in .” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady called for an emergency Budget from Chancellor Rishi Sunak.She said: “Everyone should have the security to be able to pay their bills. But household incomes are being obliterated as wages fail to keep pace with the spiralling cost of living. “We can’t go on like this… Rising hardship is a political choice. Ministers must not abandon families in their hour of need.” Stephen Evans, Chief Executive of Learning and Work Institute, said: “This February, people saw the biggest single month fall in regular pay in real terms since December . But this cost of living crisis is not being experienced equally. “Bonuses in sectors such as finance mean some are seeing rising pay, while those on the lowest incomes saw their benefits rise by just .% yesterday, far lower than inflation. This is before the rise in National Insurance and the energy price cap, so the pain is only going to grow without action. “Meanwhile, we continue to see people falling out of the labour market altogether, especially carers, retired people and long term sick.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cost of Living: Were Here to Help\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nine-year-old Middlesbrough fan Theo Baverstock was intending to watch his hometown club with his dad Graeme against Fulham on Wednesday evening.However, he suffered second degree on his foot after a fellow supporter dropped a freshly poured cup of Bovril on his foot, which left him in AE, TeessideLive reports.His dad Graeme said: We went to the Boro game and we were stood in the queue and a gentleman turned around with a cup of bovril. He dropped it by accident and it went straight onto Theoaposs foot. Straight away he started screaming so itaposs gone through his shoe and his sock. First aid got involved as did the club doctor and he got taken straight to hospital where they found he had second degree burns. I felt really sorry for the gentleman who dropped it, he didnapost mean to do it and it was a total accident.Theo is quite shook up, heaposs just had it rebandaged. Heaposs had to go every two days to the hospital for checks on it. I just wanted to say that it could happen to anyone. Itaposs not against them butit is being served so hot it can so easily be dropped on anyoneaposs foot like it has done. Heaposs got a bit of an infection in it and he has to go onto antibiotics. It looks quite bad at the moment. The extent of Theoaposs burns are visible in the graphic picture which show how badly his foot was injured after the accident at the Riverside. The liquid soaked through his trainers and sock before scalding him. Although Theo is now recovering at home, he is struggling to sit and rest as heaposs a bit of a live wire.

It was an absolute total accident, no one is to blame for it.

He said: Iaposve got nothing but praise for the staff, the club have been great and theyaposve contacted me as well to see how he is. They didnapost have to do that.

Fuming mum-of-three Joanne Black says she gave her £, gown to Alterations by Janice in Paisley, Scotland, at the beginning of March to have the shoulders of the frock lted and the sleeves taken up.But the -year-old told the Daily Record she was less than impressed when, five weeks later, she picked up her dress only to find that none of the adjustments had been made.The mum, who said the dress was in a garment bag when she collected it, claims she was disgusted to find it covered in dog hair, dirt and dust asit had been dragged along the ground. Joanne, who is due to tie the knot with her partner of three years, Tony, in Auchen Castle in Moffat on May , says the experience has robbed her of all her excitement in the run-up to her special day.She told the Record: Iaposve been so stressed. I didnapost sleep the night I got it back and I was crying. Itaposs stressful enough organising a wedding, but this has really put me off my dress.

You only planned to get married once and you should be so excited about it, but itaposs totally turned the other way. On one part of the sleeve, you can literally pull the fabric and see itaposs just falling away. I have no idea what sheaposs done to the hem either... the bottom is all pinned up which I never even asked for. The dress has come back absolutely bogging. Joanne suffers from anxiety, so asked her mum to approach the shop the day after the garment was ed to go over her concerns. But the family claim Alterations by Janice refused to refund the £ Joanne paid to have the adjustments done on the grounds that she wonapost take her dress back into the shop to be fixed.  With time ticking on, Joanne has now had to borrow money from her aunt and book in with another alteration service in Glasgow, leaving her a further £ out of pocket - another blow to her aposbudget weddingapos. Joanne continued: Even when I had my dress on to get altered in the shop, the owneraposs dog was walking all over the bottom of it. She says she makes her customers aware that thereaposs a dog, but she didnapost make me aware. If I was told that detail, I wouldnapost have picked that shop. My heart was racing and my palms were sweating. I felt so uncomfortable and I just couldnapost wait to get out of there. It was a terrible experience. Looking back, I shouldaposve just taken my business where, but I donapost like confrontation. When I went to the new shop in Glasgow with my dress, they couldnapost believe the mess of it. Joanne now plans to pursue the matter with Trading Standards in the hope of getting her money back. She added: Iaposm not leaving this. Iaposve got three kids and Iaposve not got a lot of money to throw about.

His mum says his massive growth is thanks to his hearty breakfasts of porridge. Alpha was born via C-section on October  last year, weighing in at a chunky lbs oz, making him Britainaposs third largest newborn.Despite not yet being six months old, big boy Alpha - who now weighs st lbs, is already wearing clothing designed for nine to -month-olds. Mum Cherral Mitchell, , told the Sun she has had to wean her hungry little man off milk.Now Alpha loves to chow down on porridge and rusk biscuits, even though most babies donapost do so until at least  weeks. Cherral said: We knew he was going to be a big boy as my bump was huge, but we didnapost realise quite how big he would be until he was here. Iaposd had three babies before and with Alpha it felt like we skipped the newborn stage altogether and went straight to him being three months old.” People often mistake Alpha and his sister Twyla-Bay for twins, despite her being more than three times his age, Cherral said, because Alpha is already almost the same height as her.Alpha starts the day with baby porridge, followed by a oz bottle of baby milk every three hours and a baby rusk biscuit in the evening. Cherral who is also mum to Rouge-Angel, five, Lyon, three, and Twyla-Bay, one, with electrical engineer husband Tyson, , said none of her other children were anywhere near Alpha’s size at the same age. When he was born at John Radclfe Hospital in  Cherral and Tyson were shocked at his size, despite doctors’ predictions that their baby would be a whopper. Cherral added: “When we first saw him, my first thought was he was not going to fit into any of the clothes I’d brought in the hospital bag. Tyson even had to go home to bring back some three to six-month clothes for him.” Hospital staff measured Alpha and began to google records for the largest babies born in the UK right there in the delivery room. They excitedly informed Cherral that her newborn was the third-largest in the UK.

Sunseeking Brits looking to head overseas for a much-needed break are being warned to plan ahead as thousands are rocking up without the Covid certication they need to get to their destination.In Britain, the Government has scrapped all of its previous travel rules from Covid tests to qurantine periods, while other countries have also begun to lt their restrictions. France recently reopened to unvaccinated Brits for holidays, with no quarantine requirements, while anyone aged  or over can visit Spain provided they are either fully vaccinated against Covid, or can show proof of recent recovery.However, the rules are dferent for each country and the many still have restrictions in place, as holidaymakers are finding out to their dismay.  Many still require a negative test result - something a number of Brit travellers appear not to realise. Not only have they had to pay up to £ for last minute testing, passengers have risked missing their flight as they wait in long queues at airports that are already under strain due to staff shortages and a particularly busy Easter period.Nick Markham, co-founder of Cignpost ExpressTest, who offer Covid testing at a number of UK airports, told Travel Weekly that Brit holidaymakers were turning up weithout the correct Covid test certication for their intended destination.He said: “Because the UK government has lted all Covid restrictions, people naturally assume that all testing everywhere has ended.  “However, many countries still have some level of Covid testing in place for arrivals. They include the US, which requires all travellers to take a negative Covid test no more than  hours before they fly, and most of Europe’s short haul destinations, which have testing rules for arrivals who are not fully vaccinated, often including children aged  and over.” If you want to travel to the United States, you must provide a negative Covid test  hours before flying. While many European holiday destinations require children who are not fully vaccinatred to provide negative Covid tests to prove they are not carrying the bug.  And Brits could be stung in the wallet, with last-minute, unplanned Covid tests reportedly ranging in price from £ to as much as £results are needed urgently in a few hours. And travellers still risk missing flights waiting for results to come back or stuck waiting in long queues to do their tests.Speaking to the Sun, Mr Markham added: Airports are already under pressure with staff shortages often themselves caused by COVID infections. That could mean longer queues at check-ins or for essential purchases at the airport.So having to queue for a last-minute test and then hoping the result comes through in time could leave travellers without time to clear security and catch their flight. We are urging all holidaymakers to check the entry requirements carefully for their destination before their departure date, and to book all necessary tests at the airport or in advance to avoid any last-minute holiday regrets.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus testingHolidaysCoronavirusHeathrow Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The couple, who live in Melksham, Wiltshire, have been forced to give up their social lives as cash is so tight and have even stopped using their oven to keep bills down. Gerald served in the Royal Air Force for  years and feels the country he devoted his le to is letting him down. He tells The Mirror: “I don’t want to complain really because I‘ve had a good le, but it comes as a huge disappointment.In the quiet hours when you sit and think, well we did all that and we’ve ended up with all this worry. You’re sort of living on the edge really. “I don’t knowit’s a matter of age but you think, what did we do all that for  Le has changed completely.

It grieves me to do it, but there you go, I just can’t do anything about it.” Since their bills jumped from £ to £, Gerald and Mair have started setting strict budgets for their daily gas and electricity usage, which means giving up the use of their central heating altogether. Gerald has worked out that it costs him p to boil his kettle - a cheaper solution that allows both him and Mair to surround themselves with multiple hot water bottles to stay warm while at home.They’ve also stopped using the oven to keep costs low, relying instead on their microwave. He said: “We’re on a fixed income so there’s nothing we can do about it. I can put it on and go into debt but I just want somebody to do something. “I can’t imagine a time that I can turn the heating on again, there’s nothing in sight and there’s nothing  I can do” “The dference between £ and £ - it’s a chasm that I can’t cross. I’m not putting the heating on because I refuse to go into into debt.” Gerald added: At night, we cover the bed in coats and use an extra blanket because Mair is particularly susceptible to the cold. We wear coats indoors now. They’re like long jackets lined with synthetic wool. We’re having to use those in bed too just to make sure we keep warm. As you get older, the extremes of heat and cold affect you more. “We’ve got an Aga, but we have no plans to use that. Putting it on would be absolutely catastrophic. We just use it for storage - it’s just a nice piece of furniture now, nothing .And yet this isnapost the only dficulty that the couple are facing, as the cost increase came shortly after -year-old Mair was diagnosed with vascular dementia. Gerald added:I’m trying to take it in my stride. It’s unavoidable, but just another thing to worry about really. Iaposm afraid with my weaposs illness, they sort of retreat within themselves. She doesnapost have opinions now. She has very basic feelings like aposI’m too coldapos or aposI’m too hot.aposGerald went viral on Twitter last month after sharing a message about how the price hikes are impacting their lives. He said: “Our heating is the biggest expense we’ve got. We live on very average pensions, and the reason why I put the tweet out wasnapost an appeal for help or anything, it was anger. I was so angry. When I worked the figures out I thought, my God, what am I doing  I had loads of people come back to me and say, aposweaposll give you some moneyapos. I even had a young woman say, Iaposm a single mum but Iaposve got some money put away and you’re welcome to half of it. He added: From a large point of view, there is help. I’ve also got my family.

It’d cover bills full stop, says Gerald. But Gerald believes that he shouldnapost have to rely on others to support him financially, and that the government should be held responsible for the effects that the cost of living crisis are having on regular people like himself.  I detest the thought of relying on benefits. The kindness of strangers. I really hate that. People are generous. I know that from the tweet. That really surprised me.

She believes another criminal snuck into her car, a few yards away, and stole her card.According to CCTV taken inside the supermarket, a third criminal was loitering behind her, and watched her insert her PIN at the checkout. She thinks the trio worked as a team to fleece her in the shocking broad daylight theft.  Since the incident Lola, who is a widow, has struggled to sleep and has become wary of leaving her home in Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire.The mother of four told Express : I have been told this activity is re, particularly in some supermarket car parks in and around London.Itaposs affected me very much. I have been struggling to sleep because I think about it all the time. It is just so clear in my mind. I have felt sad and worried, and stupid to be honest. It is just very upsetting. I have been very very upset and I no longer trust people. It was absolutely disgusting.  The money is yet to be reimbursed into Ms Sledmereaposs account although police are investigating the theft. Ms Sledmere, who worked in psychology, added: Of course, it has impacted me financially too. I am a pensioner. I have a state pension but Iaposm not well off at all. I live alone, so of course it is going to affect me financially. I have seven grandchildren who all need money and it is upsetting I canapost help them at the moment. After Ms Sledmere paid for her shopping, itaposs thought she was followed out of the supermarket and to her car by the man who saw her PIN.  She put her shopping and handbag in her vehicle, left it unlocked as she turned to push the trolley to the bay just yards away. But another man spoke to her at the bay, asking for directions to Chesham, which is less than three miles away. Ms Sledmere said: I thought this was strange. I thought he was being a bit stupid actually as there are plenty of signs for Chesham and itaposs only around the corner. But I offered help. Someone previously must have looked over my shoulder and got my PIN number when I was paying at the checkout. The checkout was the very one closest to the enclosure where people pay for their own groceries so it is pretty open and easy just for someone to stand there and not to be noticed.

Paige Rice, , was a passenger in an Audi S when it was involved in a fatal smash with a a Mercedes taxi in the Queensway Tunnel in October last year.Her ex-partner Callum Miller, , a labourer from Stockport, was clocking speeds of mph as he drove the Audi through the tunnel - which connects Liverpool and Birkenhead.An inquest into their deaths, held at Gerard Majella Courthouse in Kirkdale on January , heard Merseyside Police initially launched a criminal investigation into a potential offence of causing death by dangerous driving.But the probe was dropped when it became clear Callum would not survive.Dashcam footage of the crash, which also left the taxi driver with le-changing injuries to his leg and hip, has now emerged on social media, the Liverpool Echo reports. Clare Rice, Paigeaposs mum said she has not been able sleep since finding out that the video was circulating online as she asked people to remove any posts containing the footage. Ms Rice wrote: Yesterday, I found out there’s a video circulating on social media, a video of the crash that killed my daughter. Now I have no idea who has this video and how it’s got online but I want you to know, I’ve not slept since and I feel sick to the stomach. After we lost Paige I was askedI wanted to view the footage, I chose not to for my own sanity. When you grieve someone who’s died and in such a tragic way, Your mind chooses what to think about and what to block out.Finding out the video was online has been really triggering for me, moments which I’d been blocking out to survive my days were now at the forefront of my mind. Why would you want to watch my daughteraposs last moments  I’m heartbroken, the thought of strangers, people who don’t know Paige or me watching something so traumatic and distressing. When people post such personal pictures or videos without consent, it can have a serious impact on people’s lives. Ms Rice said her le has been turned upside down by the death of her daughter as she shared a series of photos of herself with Paige growing up. She continued: I’m still Paige’s mum and I still have that protective instinct. I know Paige would hate that this video is online. Look at these pictures, this is my beautul baby girl Paige.  She was taken from us in October, only  years old. No matter how old your child gets, they’re still our babies. I had Paige at a young age and it’s Pretty much always been us three. My le has revolved around my children and making sure they never went without. I can’t tell you how much my le has been turned upside down since loosing my daughter. When you lose a child, just getting through an hour is an accomplishment.  The last five months has been a blur when it comes to time and I don’t know how I’m surviving each day with this heartache, a pain you will never know, unless you’ve lived it. To cause added stress and upset is disrespectful and thoughtless. My le will never be the same again. I’ve lost my daughter and my friend and my son has lost his sister and we’ve all lost a massive piece of our lives. Paige left behind many broken hearts, she is loved and now missed by so many people, someone’s daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece, cousin and friend. We don’t deserve any more upset.

The two-bedroom garden flat is for sale at £, and offers new meaning to the phrase aposgreen livingapos.From the roadside, there is nothing that makes it stand out from the other terraced homes in the street in trendy Hackney, north London. But inside, all the rooms are covered in botanical wallpaper and furnishings. The lounge has green fern leaves on the walls and also on the sofa and armchair, plus flowers on the wall and lampshade. One of the bedrooms has been decorated with bright pink floral wallpaper with a matching chair and cushions on the bed.  Even the bathroom doesnapost escape the theme and there are fresh, cut flowers in the kitchen. Ironically the place with the fewest flowers is the walled garden of the pad. The apartment is on the market with Chestertons estate agents, but the Rightmove listing makes no mention of the floral theme. It reads: Tucked away on this quiet street is this stunning two bedroom garden flat, which truly has to be seen to be believed.  On entering the property through your own private entrance, you are welcomed into a wonderfully bright open plan kitchen and living. Which leads directly onto the private garden, offering the perfect space for entertaining. Every inch of this property has been meticulously renovated by the current owner, bringing together modern design with vintage charm.  From the bespoke House of Hackney wallpaper, brass countertops in the kitchen, and hand cut tiles in the bathroom, the property is immaculately presented throughout and offers the perfect first home. The master bedroom is well proportioned and offers a wealth of storage, including a generous basement area.

She has been the monarchaposs personal advisor and senior dresser, working with her closely every day, for almost  years. It seems the two women know each other inside out and reportedly love nothing more than chatting over a cup of tea.In , Angela got extraordinary permission from her boss to release the book - The Other Side of the Coin - which featured never before seen behind-the-scenes photos and insider information about le at Buckingham Palace. And just yesterday, it was announced that an updated version of the book is to be released next month to coincide with Her Majestyaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations.In the original book, Angela shared several secrets about the Queen and what le is like behind palace walls. Here we take a look at some of these - and look at what she will be revealing in the updated version of the book... Trick for shoes As the staff member in charge of the Queenaposs wardrobe, Angela revealed in her book many handy tips and tricks she uses when it comes to looking after Her Majestyaposs clothes, accessories and jewellery.Before the book was released, it had long been reported that Her Majesty employs an assistant to wear in her shoes.

Click here to sign up .But in her book, Angela confirmed the reports and revealed that sheaposs the flunky who does it. She writes: The Queen has very little time to herself and not time to wear in her own shoes, and as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way. Most of the time, the Queen wears black low heeled shoes by shoemaker Anello  Davide, which she reportedly calls her work shoes. Love of make up  Another secret that Angela ulged is that the Queen is a dab hand when it comes to applying her make-up.In fact, she reveals how the monarch does her own make-up nearly every day - apart from on one occasion, the day her Christmas message is filmed.Angela reveals: You might be surprised to know that this is the only occasion throughout the year when Her Majesty does not do her own make-up. Instead, she enlists the help of TV make-up artist Marilyn Widdess. Queen asked for line in James Bond sketch  Back in  when London hosted the Olympics, one of the highlights of the opening ceremony was the Queenaposs sketch with James Bond, played by Daniel Craig. Angela recalled being presented with the plan for the skit, devised by film director Danny Boyle, who had been tasked with coming up with a stunning ceremony to open the  Games.And she explained Her Majesty was keen for a speaking part during her cameo appearance with  to celebrate all things British.There are few occasions on which Her Majesty will agree to break protocol, but in  when film director Danny Boyle approached the Royal Household, he had a request to make that we simply could not refuse, Angela writes in her book. She was very amused by the idea and agreed immediately. I asked thenshe would like a speaking part. Without hesitation, Her Majesty replied: aposOf course I must say something. After all, he is coming to rescue meapos. Ms Kelly said she asked the Queenshe would like to say: Good evening, James, or Good evening, Mr Bond, with the monarch choosing the latter. She said: Within minutes, I was back in Edwardaposs office delivering the good news to Danny - I think he almost fell off his chair when I said that the Queenaposs only stipulation was that she could deliver that iconic line: aposGood evening, Mr Bondapos. Inappropriate photo  The Queen has posed for thousands of pictures since she took the throne in .But according to Angela, there was one pose sheaposd always longed to have a portrait taken in, but was never allowed. In her book, she revealed Her Majesty wanted a picture taken in a more informal pose, like with her hands in her pockets, but the Queen Mother and Queen Counselors had always asked her not to do as they were not suitable for the public eye.But Angela, who had known about the Queenaposs secret wish for several years, had a clever idea that would make it come true. She says: I wonderedI might have a wonderful opportunity to make the Queenaposs wish come true. She nervously asked the Queenshe would do her a favour and pose with her hands in her pockets for an image in the book. Angela said: The Queen looked at me in amazement as I asked whether she knew the implications of the photographs. She didnapost take long to answer: yes, she would do it and, yes, she was sure. Christening gown trick  As well as being tasked with taking care of the Queenaposs clothes - and even designing some herself - Angela has also taken charge of items worn by several members of the Royal Family. From  until , all royal babies had worn a christening gown made from Honiton lace for the children of Queen Victoria.But as the gown had become rather old, the Queen commissioned Angela to create a replica version for use in the future. So how did she get the colour of the gown just right  Yorkshire Tea. In her book, Angela wrote: She writes: Together, we sourced lace to complement that being made in Italy, and to make sure it looks authentic we dyed it in Yorkshire tea . We placed each piece of lace in a small bowl, from the Dressersapos kitchen, filled with cool water and a tea bag, and left it for about five minutes, checking regularly until the colour was perfect. The gown has since been worn by the likes of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Harry and Meghanaposs son Archie. Cruel prank  As well as sharing tricks and tips, Angela also gave an insight into her close bond with her boss - and how they share a similar sense of humour.Angela explained that the Queen was desperate to see a kookaburra bird during their Royal Tour to Australia in .She didnapost have any luck spotting one, so when Angela saw a cute toy version during a trip to a market in Sydney while her boss was at an engagement, she decided to buy it for her. But rather than just giving it to her, she decided to have a bit of fun first. When she got back to Governoraposs House, where they were all staying, she placed the toy in a little cage on the balcony outside her room. When the Queen got back Angela told her she had spotted a funny looking grey bird through the window. The Queen looked outside and shouted aposItaposs a kookaburra!apos I went to open the cage doors and she said loudly aposNo! Donapost do that! It will fly away!apos and was behind me in a flash. Turning to her Majesty while trying to keep a straight face, I solemnly told her it was dead. The Queen looked horried until Angela walked towards her with outstretched arms and said April Fool. She had only two words for me: Youaposre sacked. I was laughing uncontrollably as her Majesty turned to His Royal Highness and said Do you know what she has just done to me  Angela has had me!. The Queen took the little toy back to Windsor Castle with her and it now lives on the back of the sofa in her private living room. Queen enjoyed Michelle Obamaaposs hug In , former First Lady of the US Michelle Obama broke the so-called no touch rule when she appeared to put her arm around the Queen, with royal experts calling it an extraordinary gesture.But according to Angela, Her Majesty quite enjoyed the touching moment with Mrs Obama. She wrote in her book: Much has been made about the meeting between Michelle and Her Majesty when an instant and mutual warmth was shared between these two remarkable women, and protocol was abandoned as they stood closely with their arms around each otheraposs backs. In reality it was a natural instinct for the Queen to show affection and respect for another great woman and really there is no protocol that must be adhered to. When fondness is felt or the host of a State Visit goes to guide her Majesty up some steps, it truly is about human kindness and this is something the Queen will always welcome warmly. New secrets When the updated version of Angelaaposs book is released next month, it will feature a new chapter that has covered the last two years. So what can we expect in it Well according to publisher Harper Collins, the update will see Angela will talk about the royal householdaposs isolation during Covid- lockdown at Windsor Castle, which saw her taking on new roles such as cutting and setting the Queenaposs hair. The chapter will also cover Prince Philipaposs funeral, the Queenaposs first public engagement post-lockdown and a look ahead to Juneaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations.Katya Shipster from Harper Collins said: We are so proud to be Angela Kellyaposs publishers. We wanted to commemorate the extraordinary occasion of the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee with this beautul new edition, as well as bring the book right up to date following the unprecedented events of the past two years. It tells the story of the Royal bubble as well as the s Angela and the Royal Household went to, to ensure the safety of our monarch. There is no better look at what goes on behind the pomp and circumstance than this wonderful book.

Latest data show a huge . per cent week-on-week fall in people testing positive for the virus, while hospitalisations have remained stable.Sadly the UKaposs official Covid- death toll passed ,, with , people dying within  days of a positive test in last week.Scotland, where lateral flow tests are still available for free until later this month, is recording the highest rate of infections, latest data shows. In England the South West is recording the largest infection rate, figures released by the Department of Health confirm. It comes as the NHS Confederation warned that very high rates of Covid- are having a major impact on the health service - which is facing pressures it would see in a bad winter well into spring.It warned that ministers risk abandoning the NHSthey do not take action.As well as dealing with large volumes of Covid- patients, there are high rates of staff absences due to the virus, full hospitals and severe demands on emergency care.In the week commencing March , , delays of half an hour or longer were recorded in ambulance hand overs across all hospital trusts in England.

Growing up in Italy, Claudia Serra knew something was dferent about her voice. She realised that she couldnapost scream in the playground like other children and singing in school plays was hard as well.Even just talking in a noisy environment or with a group was exhausting,My London reports. When Claudia was , she decided to see a doctor, and was diagnosed with left vocal cord paralysis, a rare condition which causes the voice to sound breathy, quiet and weak, and can affect the breathing.If both cords are affected, the voice can disappear altogether.In Claudiaaposs case, the condition was caused at birth as she was been born prematurely at just six months old. The -year-old said: Despite the pathology, it was a relief to know what was happening. It was the answer I had been waiting for for a long time, especially in adolescence...I was ready to do what I could to find my voice. Once she had finished school, Claudia started speech therapy, which aimed to move the working cord towards the paralysed one. After nine months of twice-weekly sessions and daily breathing and vocal exercises, she found out that, despite some nodules on her vocal cords being removed, her voice still sounded the same.In , Claudia opted for a surgical intervention, known as an Injection Laryngoplasty. The surgery works by injecting fat into the vocal cords to increase their volume - and means that Claudia lost her voice entirely for a week, communicating with a pen and paper. When it re-emerged, it had increased in strength - but only temporarily. The following year, Claudia says she re-attempted the same surgery, only to find that the results were similar: a brief period of improvement, before her voice ed to its previous state. For the next six years, Claudia tried dferent forms of speech therapy, to little success.  Eventually, she says her doctors in Italy told her that there was nothing more that they could do for her. She said: This brought me a lot of sadness...I have never been able to enjoy a nice evening in the pub, or go out for dinner with a group because it is dficult to be heard in noisy environments. Otherwise at the end of the day, vocal fatigue assaults you and you no longer want to talk to anyone. A vocal problem affects everyday le. Itaposs not just about having a hoarse or lower tone - the voice is a delicate communication tool. [We use it to]communicate, to work, have social relationships and to express our feelings. The voice is the mirror of the soul.In October , having moved to London two years earlier, Claudia had her third surgery: a thyroplasty, where an implant was inserted through the cartilage into her voice box. She was optimistic, and at first pleased with the results. She said: After surgery in November my voice was much louder, as was my laughter and coughing. I had less respiratory fatigue while walking, for example, and in noisier environments it seemed easier to raise my voice and speak. But in December, Claudia felt disappointed again, as her voice began to strain in loud environments. [Itaposs like] I miss the air, asI were climbing a mountain. I have to rest, plus [I have] neck and throat pain. At the time, Claudia says she was working at a dog grooming salon. With the sound of dogs barking, pets being washed and people talking, Claudia says it became dficult for her to communicate - leading to fatigue and severe neck pain - and she left the job. It was a real blow that Claudiaaposs third surgery hadnapost altered her voice. She said: I was hoping that with the last intervention I would finally be able to get my voice, to get more vocal stability, but it didnapost happen. Of course, there are those very dficult and despondent moments, but then I look inside myself and I see that there is still that strength and courage to go on and keep fighting.

In terms of her work, she is having a hard time finding a job which will accommodate her needs. She enjoyed her role at the grooming salon, and loves cooking, flowers and photography, but requires a quiet working environment where she does not have to strain or raise her voice. All this has made me a very empathetic, sensitive person who knows how to listen, said Claudia. I would also like to expand my knowledge on the voice - and maybe one day help someone like me.  And, despite her long struggle to be heard, Claudia is finally speaking out: she runs a YouTube channel and Instagram account where she shares her experiences, and intends to write a book about her vocal journey.She said: Despite the ups and downs, these years in search of my voice have given me the strength not to give up. There are many people with dferent vocal problems, who do not feel understood, who feel alone, who do not know how to treat their pathology, or who give up. I want them to know that they are not alone and that they donapost have to give up...I know how hard it can be, but one day you will find your voice!

The woman explained that only people named in the invitations are allowed to attend her wedding day, and said that people will have their partner listed as a guestthey are someone that the bride and groom personally know, would go to dinner with, or would have been invited regardless of their relationship status. In her post, the bride also insisted that her rule even extends to engaged couples and married couples, who will be expected to leave their fiancés and spouses behind for the day.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: Iaposm getting married and like every other bride, I too have certain rules I want for my wedding to go smoothly. One of them is the no plus ones rule. Only people named in the invitation are invited. The criteria I have for people who will get to bring their partners are:Both my fiancé and I know of your partner and have met them. If I know your partner and my fiancé doesnapost, that disqualies them and vice versa. If Iaposd personally go to dinner with you and your partner. If Iaposd invite your partner as a separate person anyway and not just because theyaposre your partner. If your partner is also a friend of mine.Those who meet those criteria get to bring their partners. If they donapost, then they donapost bring them. Simple.  That also excludes long term relationships, engaged couples and married couples as well. We know it might seem harsh but those are the rules weaposve decided to set so we can be more comfortable. It has nothing to do with budget or venue capacity. Purely our choice. After making her rules clear, the woman found that several people on her guest list have chosen to reject the invitation and not attend the wedding - including her cousin, who isnapost allowed to bring his fiancée despite their one-year engagement. The bride admitted sheaposs heartbroken that her cousin wonapost attend her wedding, but still wonapost budge and let him bring his partner, as she claims sheaposs not someone she would personally be friends with.  She added: Several people have denied the invitation to our wedding due to these rules. One of them is also my cousin. My cousin has been engaged to this girl for one year now and he was upset we didnapost include her. The reason she was excluded was that my fiancé hasnapost met her and sheaposs not a person Iaposd personally be friends with either. I told my cousin how heartbroken I am that he will not come to the wedding due to this and I expressed my distaste for the fact that he canapost be away from his fiancée for a few hours to honour me and my fiancé. Couples donapost have to be together the whole time. Then he basically told me Iaposm being extremely disrespectful. Her cousin then explained that he has no problem being away from his fiancée but doesnapost want to attend a wedding for someone who has no respect for his relationship. But the bride doubled down, stating that those are the rules and he can take it or leave it. She continued: He says he finds my rules extremely disrespectful but since its my wedding he has no say in it. I told him to show his support and respect by attending. He said that while he respects my extremely exclusive and disrespectful rules, I am a fool to believe that he will care more about valuing my wedding over his fiancée. Commenters on the Reddit post were equally baffled by the brideaposs strict rules, as many of them stated that while sheaposs well within her rights to host her wedding in whichever way she chooses, she should also respect when people donapost want to attend. One person said: While itaposs your wedding and youaposre allowed to make rules, rules also cause people to not attend. Your wedding means a lot to you, but that doesnapost have to mean the same thing to others. He isnapost attending which is a result of your rules. While another added: You are entitled to have your rules, but that comes with the expectation and acknowledgement that people are allowed to not attend due to said rules. You told him apostake it or leave itapos, then moaned about him leaving it.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeddingsWedding dayMarriageUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Having chosen John as her aposmaidapos of honour, Sabrina, , had no idea whatsoever that heaposd play that exact same voicemail back on her wedding day, all while her  guests - including Brendonaposs elderly grandparents - looked on.

When he said aposweaposre going to invite Sabrina up to say some special words... from the pastapos, I was terried. Of course, in true best friend fashion, he embarrassed the living daylight out of me, in front of my friends and family, [where I was] dropping the F-bombs all over the place and calling my husband incredibly sexy in front of his grandparents. I was hoping it wasnapost too incriminating because I went into a lot of detail [back then]. I was sweating. According to Sabrina, she had attempted to play hard-to-get for months after first meeting Brandon, even claiming that she wasnapost actually looking for a relationship. However, the voicemail showed once and for all that this wasnapost the case, with her cool-as-a-cucumber exterior having masked her true excitement about making such a special connection.

A new study has revealed failing to wash your dogaposs food bowl on a regular basis could not only affect their health, but yours too.The research, undertaken by the Food and Drug Association , investigates dog ownersapos feeding habits and evaluates the impact of FDAaposs hygiene protocols on dog food dish contamination.They found only  per cent of the  dog owners surveyed wash their dogaposs dish daily,  per cent clean it once a week, while another  per cent wash it every three months or not at all.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The FDA states this poses signicant health risks to pets and pet owner as it create an environment where harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, can thrive.Both salmonella and listeria can cause diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps or pain, nausea in humans, with symptoms more severe in pregnant women, children, adults over the age of , and people with weakened immune systems. When it comes to food storage and preparation,  per stored dog food within . meters of human food,  per cent washed their hands after feeding and  per cent prepared their dog food on prep surfaces intended for human use. The study reads: It was found that the vast majority of study dog owners were not aware of and did not follow FDA pet food handling and storage guidelines. Response to inidual recommendations ied, however hygiene-related handling practicesshowed overall low levels of compliance.  Additionally, studies in humans regarding self-reported handwashing show an overestimation of hygiene and similar forces, including the effects of social desirability bias, could be expected in this study. Exposure to contaminated dog food can have implications for canine and human health. For example, there have been multiple outbreaks of both humans and dogs becoming ill after exposure to dog food contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. These risks may be amplied in households with children and or immunocompromised iniduals, which were over a third of respondents’ households.The FDA has set out a list of guidelines for owners to follow to lower their risk of developing an illness from contaminated pet food and treats.The FDA recommends:Buy pet food productsthat are in good condition. Check the packaging for visible signs of damage, such as dents, tears, and discolorations. Begin and end with clean hands. Both before and after handling pet food and treats, wash your hands for at least  seconds with soap and hot water. Wash pet food bowls and scooping utensils with soap and hot water after each use. Do not use your pet’s food bowl as a scooping utensil. Use a clean scoop, spoon, or cup instead. Use the scooping utensil only for scooping pet food. Throw out old or spoiled pet food in a safe way, for example, by placing it in a securely tied plastic bag in a covered trash can. Promptly refrigerate or throw out unused or leftover canned and pouched pet food. Tightly cover refrigerated pet food. Set your refrigerator to  F or below. Store dry pet food in a cool and dry place. The temperature should be less than  F. Excess heat or moisture can cause the nutrients to break down. Store dry pet food in its original bag and keep the top of the bag tightly folded down. Keep pet food in a secure location to prevent your pet from eating an entire supply at once.A statement reads: Proper storage of pet food and treats maintains the products’ nutritional value and keeps information handy in case there’s a problem. Proper storage also prevents your pet from getting into his own food and eating too much or getting into your cat’s special diet food. Overeating or eating food that is meant for another pet can lead to health problems, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or more severe conditions.

Sculptor Bob Cassilly had the idea for Cementland, which was a -acre attraction that was once a thriving factory outside of St. Louis, Missouri but when the factory closed down, the area became a dumping ground for construction companies.The theme park was herald as one of the strangest theme parks in America for its niche theme and troubles over the years, the Daily Star reports.The original cement buildings had been neglected and decaying- but Cassilly had a vision to spruce up the landscape to a wide range of dferent ideas.  Mr Cassilly had a vision which ran more than just cement and ruins as he saw an idea for art and history, architecture, and evolution. Bob said back in : “They talk about historic districts and stuff like that but one of the main things is, our architecture is basically copying stuff from Europe. But our industry, it’s kind of like jazz, it’s an American, original thing.  Why not look at it for what it is  It’s impressive. It might be threatening, but you can’t help but be impressed by it.” The attraction has been photographed by Paul Sableman, where you can see glimpses of Mr Cassillyaposs vision for the amusement park were slowly taking place. His dream was to create an art amusements park but it never got off the ground after a horrying incident where Cassilly was tragically run down by a bulldozer and killed on the building site of Cementland on September , . He was  years old.  However, his widow and several medical experts didn’t believe that Bob’s cause of death was a bulldozer accident. In , physician Dr Arthur Combs reexamined the autopsy reports and said he believes the sculptor was beaten to death before the murder scene was staged to look like an accident.Over the last six years, the ruins have fallen into further disrepair after a warehouse fire caused a roof to fall in. There was an attempt to put security in who were hired to keep vandals and trespassers away in  but in  there is no evidence that this arrangement remains in place, according to the latest photographs. And over the last last six years, the land has been neglected after a warehouse fire caused a roof to fall in. In order to honour Cassilly’s le, memorials have been held at Cementland but the attraction remains incomplete.

Chlamydia, she revealed. Apparently, the mum-to-be has been obsessed with the name ever since reading The Odyssey in school and always liked her Greek Mythology stories.

Right apos And sheaposs all, aposNo, I meant Chlamydia.aposAfter a quick Google search proved that she was right, the friend backed down - but she was noticeably annoyed for the rest of the night.When the Reddit poster went home that night, she received a long text from the mum, calling her a bad friend for embarrassing her in front of everyone. She says I could have brought it up in private and didnapost need to be so condescending about it.She was just talking about a name she liked and I made her feel like an idiot. The woman said she ignored the text, as she thought her friend was being an idiot, for basing her childaposs name on a book she hadnapost read in years and mixing it up with an STI. A simple google search before getting so attached to the name would have solved the problem before there was one, she said. But then she started getting texts from the other girls in the group telling her how upset the mum was and how she should apologise.I donapost think I have anything to apologise for, and besides, they were perfectly happy to sit there and let her think her std baby name would be a good choice, she continued. Imagine how embarrassed she would have been after she found the mistake later and realised that none of her friends had the decency to tell her the truth. She concluded her post by asking Reddit users whether she was in the wrong but the majority said she did the right thing. One person said: You didn’t embarrass her - every single person within earshot already clocked her mistake - you were the only person decent enough to correct her. Another wrote: If sheaposs old enough to be pregnant, she should be old enough to know what chlamydia is. She embarrassed herself.

A loving nan stretched out on a bed as her granddaughter stands beside her cuddling a doll – and wielding a gun. Welcome to the Mafia childhood of a -year-old mum now living quietly in a Lancashire town. Marisa Merico’s story has been made into an explosive -part TV drama, with drug deals, shootouts and an astonishing twist. Forget the The Godfather. Bang Bang Baby is about The Grandmother – the crime boss nan, Maria, in the picture who Marisa adored. And young gun-toting Marisa herself is also portrayed in Bang Bang Baby in her former le as a Mafia princess – along with her dealer dad Emilio. A rollercoaster le that would lead to her being banged up in prison – alongside Rose West and Myra Hindley.  Now reformed with a university degree in criminology, Marisa – who was raised in Blackpool – reflects on her childhood memories of summer visits to Nonna’s flat in Milan. “She was an amazing, lovely, compassionate, beautul woman – and yet she was a criminal,” says Marisa. “To see her on screen was emotional – in the kitchen, with her apron and the food. The nonna, stuffing your face with sweets. That made me cry.” But behind the facade was a hardened crime boss nicknamed Granny Heroin – in charge of an ­infamous organised drugs gang known as ’Ndrangheta. Marisa’s Blackpool-born mum Pat had no idea about this when she met Maria’s son Emilio while working as an au pair in Milan as a teenager. Love blossomed and Marisa was born – but Pat became fearful of the family’s criminal lestyle and took Marisa back to Blackpool when she was nine. It was during summer visits to see her gran that Marisa watched vast swathes of drugs arrive at the family home. Emilio and others would sort the packages of heroin and cocaine – then wait for orders from Maria, who had a razor-sharp mind even though she couldn’t read or write. And on these visits as a teenager Marisa found herself drawn into the excitement of her gran’s le – a powerful woman in a man’s world. “Bang Bang Baby shows what the women go through and the psyche of the women who get involved,” says Marisa.  “If you look at the Sopranos, Goodfellas and The Godfather, it’s all about the men. But when police raided homes, they never used to look at the women. Then they started to realise, women are the backbone. “What my dad was doing would not have worked without my nan being involved with it. My nan was such a strong character.” At  Marisa moved to Italy and became a courier for the gang, delivering packages worth £,. She married gang henchman Bruno Merico, with whom she had daughter Lara, now . At , she ed to England and bought a home kitted out in designer furniture funded by her ill-gotten gains worth almost £ million. But Marisa, now a gran herself, paid the price for being born into what she describes as “Mafia royalty” when the long arm of the law caught up with her. Police swooped on her house in a dawn raid. Lara, then two, was taken from her and Marisa was convicted of money laundering in , spending almost four years in HMP Durham’s notorious H wing, alongside killers Myra Hindley and Rose West.Marisa, who also has a son Frank, , said: “My whole world just stopped. It was heartbreaking for my daughter. She had to go to my mum. Lara was coming to see her mummy in prison. At first, she thought it was a hospital, but as she got older the truth had to be told. “Prison was not good. I was in with Rose West and Myra Hindley. I saw Rose in the showers – an image I can’t get out of my mind. She just stood there showing everything, looking at me. It made me uncomfortable. “I didn’t ever speak to Myra Hindley. Her cell smelled awful and musty. She was a heavy smoker. I remember her coming across the landing with a walking stick – she’d had a hip operation. She just looked me up and down. “She had a horrible aura about her. If I saw her in the queue in the kitchen, I’d wait a few minutes. I just didn’t want to be near her.” Just before Marisa was released in , her grandmother was sentenced to le for a string of crimes related to her role with the Mob. Around  members of the organisation were arrested. She had lost five of her  children because of addiction to the heroin on which the family’s empire depended. Maria was later freed but spent the rest of her le under house arrest after losing her vast wealth.  Marisa was reunited with her dad and gran in  – and visited Maria several more times before she died aged  in . Marisa had been at her bedside. “It was one of the saddest times of my le. I was her favourite grandchild. She was asleep but squeezed my hand. Her last words were, ‘Be a good girl’.” And with her le of crime behind her, Marisa is doing just that. Now living in Poulton-le-Fylde near Blackpool she hopes to open an Italian restaurant on the Lancashire coast with dad Emilio, , who retrained as a chef after being freed early from a -year stretch for helping police. Alongside her will be fiancé James, , who held her hand as she watched Bang Bang Baby for the first time. Marisa, who has written an autobiography, tells how the Amazon Prime drama had her in tears. She spent seven hours telling her story to the actress who plays her – -year-old Arianna Becheroni. They hugged and cried as they discussed her rollercoaster le. Marisa said: “I’m proud that I’ve been able to turn my le around and I’m now a criminologist. My studies have helped me understand why I did certain things. It was my fault in some ways because I knew right from wrong. “I beat myself up for years but when I look at the bigger picture, I can see I was a victim of circumstances and I was taken advantage of a lot. It was because I was loyal and I loved my family. “It wasn’t about the money, power or the glamorous le. It was the love I had for my nan and my dad.”Mafia Princess, published by Harper Collins, is on Amazon and in bookstores.

The womanaposs post reads: I was coming out of Tesco earlier and I saw two of their staff fill up two big trolleys of frozen food including frozen pizzas in Celbridge. The pizza sells for €. in Tesco. They sell them for €. upwards and advertise them as freshly made when they are frozen pizzas from Tesco. I understand mark up and profit on food but this is  advertising. Airtastic Celbridge issued a y response to the post to clear up the misunderstanding, denying all accusations of  advertising.  It read: We do not usually get involved in commenting on other pages but on this occasion, we need to set things straight. As correctly pointed out, our staff were indeed shopping in Tesco. This was for a shortage of party food. Unfortunately, these things happen from time to time and like any business, we have to improvise! Itaposs either that or let the hundreds of children down that have booked and are looking forward to a party. The bit that is totally incorrect is the part about  advertising. They added that the frozen foods are completely separate to what would be served in our diner and thatanyone has any concerns about the pizza, we would ask you to come and give it a try. Airtastic concluded that they are a new business in the area with a new young team that will not always get it right but will always try our best. The Mirror has approached Airtastic for comment.

Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked. Always climb gates at the hinge end.On reaching large farm sheds take the small bridge over Killean burn and cut through the field to the shore.Your route once more wends its way down the beach, over an igneous dyke and Permian red sandstone, all the way back to A’Chleit. Allow an hour for this section when checking tides.If you finish early enough there may even be time to pop down to Glenbarr stores for a well-deserved cuppa."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 28 2021 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTaken just across Loch Fyne from Tarbert, this week#s featured photo was submitted by a reader from Cowal # too modest to be named, sadly # from the site of the controversial #ark# on the hills above Tighnabruaich.The sculpture of Noah#s Ark was built # without planning consent, though later permitted # to provoke thought about the climate crisis by local environmentalist and woodworker David Blair.The sculpture has been featured many times in this and other publications, but the site on which it sits is stunning, and the photographer was standing close to the ark for the photograph.To the left is the Isle of Bute, with Tighnabruaich and Kames on the opposite side of the Kyles of Bute.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience. Now aged , Sophie Thomas has played mixed football at the club since she was five but has really enjoyed playing just with girls – particularly when ing around in the mud as a goalkeeper.“We get to play with dferent age groups and we all play well together,” she said. “I think there is more passing in girls’ football.”“It’s a completely dferent atmosphere in the girls’ team, with the older players really helping the younger ones,” added Orla Thomson, aged , and another relative veteran of mixed games. “We all love playing in front of spectators as they shout their support.

At the time, UEFA told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans’ views would be centre stage in deciding what came next.“So it is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year ‘UEFA Club Co-efficient’..remove“These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games.”UEFA’s executive committee initially approved reforms to its men’s club competitions, including the Champions League, on April  last year, but to very little fanfare or publicity as it happened in the hours after the Super League had been launched.The increase from six matches to , plus a further play-off round to determine eight of the last , along with the inclusion of two-co-efficient places were approved at that time. The group stage would increase from  to  teams, with all teams playing in one big league and facing other teams under a seeded ‘Swiss system’.UEFA has looked at the plans again in the wake of the Super League collapse, however the proposals clearly still provide far too many concessions to the big clubs in the view of Premier League fans.Under its latest proposal, teams could only qualy via the co-efficientthey finished immediately outside the regular Champions League spots, to avoid them leapfrogging rivals who finish in a higher position. However, it is understood teams could also win the FA Cup and qualy via co-efficient, whereas FA Cup winners with a lesser European pedigree would not.vw,vw,px, px\"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin “It is irresponsible and out of touch to even consider doubling the number of home games that fans will have to attend before the last - knock-out round begins,” the Network added.“This will be compounded by the cost of living crisis that is hitting Europe.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Many are willing to go the extra mile to help.I am pleased to congratulate, and thank, Campbeltonians for their collective attributes, which the rest of the country would do well to aspire to.I would like to set the record straight regarding South Islay Development ’s Port Ellen playing fields #community hub# development which was covered in last week’s Campbeltown Courier.I am one of the objectors who went round every door in Port Ellen. We gathered hundreds of signatures against this, which got the first lot of plans scrapped.So SID changed the plan to suit the roads department and resubmitted the planning application.Most of the objectors didn’t know they had to object again.SID didn’t knock on every door and ask how folk felt about it. They put leaflets through people#s doors and a lot of people didn’tthem.They also had open days, normally through the week, when people are working and can’t attend.And that is the reason I, for one, couldn’t attend the virtual planning, protective services and licensing committee meeting. People have full-time jobs and can’t attend these things at am on a Thursday.The community of Port Ellen is ided over this development.This was always intended to be a community space and now it’s being developed for tourism.We know and understand something has to happen in the area but it should have been to benefit the community, not more space going to tourism.The campervans are an eyesore but don’t think we’re saying we don’t want them on Islay, but there are places better suited for them outside the village.Equally, the people in these campervans will probably pick somewhere they have a good view, quiet and relaxing, rather than by the main road, where all ferry traffic passes.Islay will soon be unrecognisable, all for tourists and nothing for the locals.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

Signs of spring, my favourite season, were visible all over our garden. The blackbird was perched on the fence and I opened the window so I could hear his song better.I watched him for a moment. He is a regular visitor but he seemed particularly vocal this morning. Then I noticed there was a female blackbird as well. I felt privileged that I could witness their visit to our small rewilded garden, which we have tried to make bird friendly.Then the singing stopped and they both seemed to be peering down at the patch of soil where we have recently planted wildflower seeds and vegetables. The male landed on the soil and began hopping in a zig-zag fashion, stopping every now and then. At first I wonderedthis was a dance to impress the female, but soon realised he was looking for breakfast.Blackbirds love earthworms and I supposed the overnight rain on the exposed soil of our newly seeded flowerbed meant it was a good moment to go hunting for his favourite food. He was looking for worms, but also listening for them, as blackbirds can hear the sound of them moving underground. I find that almost dficult to believe, but apparently it’s true. It was fascinating and joyous to watch.But I don’t knowhe caught any worms. My attention was taken by the sound of our kids getting up. School day morning routine beckoned. Time seems to vanish in the drama of it all, and so after I kissed my we goodbye as she headed for work, I quickly got busy making the kids’ breakfast.It was at this moment an emotion overtook me: guilt. I often feel a sense of guilt when I know others are suffering terribly. One solution could be to disconnect from it, not think about it, or even try not to care. After all, we have our own family worries and problems to sort out.But the guilt comes from the empathy I feel and I don’t want to disconnect from that. I don’t think I could stop caring evenI tried. The world needs more empathy, not less. But there is a downside to it: it can become overwhelming and even affect my mental health.Guilt in this context is such a useless emotion. It doesn’t help those who are suffering and it certainly doesn’t help the person feeling empathy. So as my guilt arrived at the breakfast table that morning, I gave it short shrt and became determined to replace it with two things.The first was to learn the lesson the blackbird had taught me moments before, to enjoy the moment and the gts around me. It put me in mind of a beautul short film of the artist David Hockney, made by Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. It’s titled The World is Beautul and he talks about the beauty around us and that when bad news is dominating our senses, the arrival of spring is good news. The important thing is to really notice the gts around us, which Hockney says he does with “intensity”.So I took up his advice and, on my walk to school with my son, I made sure I was fully present for him as he talked about monsters, Dr Who and his favourite scenes from Clash of the Titans. I savoured every moment of our connection and conversations.On myto the house, I made an extra effort to notice the beauty of spring’s arrival and other gts: the diamond-like sparkle of the dew drops on the grass, and the patterns made by the children running and playing amongst them, the dedication of George the lollipop man in keeping us all safe, the brief and faint rainbow in the sky above us, and the shimmer of the sea below the trees in bloom, and the yellow carpet of daffodils dancing in the breeze the birdsong, the smiles and greeting of people, the sense of community, the warmth of the sun the fact of being alive and having loved ones in my le.The walk was only four minutes, but when we notice the beauty and gts we have around us with the intensity that Hockney mentions, then we don’t measure with time.The second thing was to change my guilt into acts of compassion that can make a dference, no matter how small. Donate, write a letter, send a message of support, whatever. That way, empathy works for positive change for those in need.I already knew all this, but it seems I constantly need to relearn it. And that morning, the blackbird helped me to do so. His song was an awakening gt, his zig-zag hop across the soil a reminder that we should have moments when we pause to look and listen with “intensity.”Asto confirm this, he was still there on the fence when I ed home. I’d love to say he had a worm in his beak, as that would have been such a poetic ending, but he didn’t. His companion wasn’t there and he flew off as I watched him.He’d made my morning by making a positive dference in ways he will never know or understand, and not just for me."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-thousands-new-trees-planted-butterdean","story":"At the end of last month, local school groups and corporate volunteers got out their gloves, boots and shovels to help plant new trees.The trust also ran a community day on Saturday, March , that saw  people participate and help populate the wood with thousands of native trees., Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" alt\"East Lothian Courier: This is the McCrum family of Tranent.Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! \" class\"editor-image\"The McCrum family of Tranent.  Mum Leigh, Ella , Abbie , Dad Corin and Daisy the dog! Woodland Trust Scotland recently acquired two open fields adjacent to Butterdean Wood, thanks to support from Bank of Scotland.

Unfortunately, I still have a job to do and won’t be holidaying for a few months, but it doesn’t stop me dreaming of sun and sea. I do love the south of France and hopefully I’ll be heading there soon.But what about my pets  When I’m away for a short spell, I like someone to look after my pets in their own home. They are relaxed in their own environment.However, when on a longer holiday, my pets are looked after extremely well by boarding kennels and cattery in East Lothian. Cats are not usually the best travellers but you can try using calming cat pheromones to relax them. Your vet can advise you on ‘Feliway’ cat calming products for any journey. My dog Lucy, on the other hand, loves travelling and adores going to the boarding kennel. She gets so excited when she knows she is on her way to the kennels.But whatyou want to take your pets with you on holiday  In Britain today, pets can travel by road, rail, sea or air. Each form of travel presents its own unique set of problems.The Highway Code is very specic about animals in cars. They should be under control in vehicles and unable to distract you while you are driving. If you want your dog to be loose in the car, he should be separated from you, and thus an estate vehicle, SUV or hatchback with a strong dog guard is ideal. Alternatively, a crate or cage can be used, the dimensions of which should be comfortable for the animal.Travel, or more correctly motion sickness, affects many dogs. It is due to the effect of the motion on the organs of balance located in the inner ear. Signs are usually excessive salivation, restlessness or excitement. Consult your veterinary surgeon as there are several prescription medicines that are extremely effective for this condition. Excitable dogs can be tranquilised but make sure you do not give too much, which may result in your pet becoming very drowsy, since the dose depends largely on the temperament and amount of excitement.Remember that even the most well-behaved dog can take fright at the sight and noise associated with a railway station and trains. Make sure that the collar and lead are strong and secure.Today, dferent railway companies have ying conditions regarding the transport of pets and therefore you should always enquire prior to your trip. Cats should be transported in secure carriers at all times. When travelling on the underground with your dog, remember it must be carried up and down any escalators. If you have a large dog, seek other means of access to the .Many ships and ferries today have permanent kennels into which your dog must be placed for the duration of the trip. The provision of a familiar blanket or toy helps to ease the tension of the journey for your pet.International Air Transport Associationregulations regarding carrier size apply to all international flights. Remember the container will be your pet’s home for theof the flight and also for an appreciable time prior to and after the flight after you have checked in and until he is collected after the flight. The carrier should be large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around freely. It is useful to use several thicknesses of newspaper, plus an acrylic dog bed of the VetBed type as bedding. A familiar article in the container helps to calm the animal. It is always worthwhile checking with the airline regarding their particular requirements.Not only has Covid- had a marked effect on travel, Brexit certainly has in respect of travelling overseas with your pets. Previously, for travel to EU countries, we vets could issue passports for your pet to travel with you to Europe. This is no longer the case.If you are considering travelling to an EU country with your pet, please start to plan long before your trip. Animals, specically dogs, cats and ferrets, require an Animal Health Certicateto travel to an EU country, including Northern Ireland. Any other pets require an Export Health Certicate or,you are travelling to non-EU countries, you will require a specic certicate issued in combination of DEFRA and the country you are travelling to.If you are travelling to an EU country, your pet needs to be microchipped and registered to you in the UK. This has to be read and confirmed by a vet prior to your pet being vaccinated against rabies.Recently, Mr Andrew Finlayson came to our Tranent surgery with his beautul greyhounds Celt and Lassie for their rabies vaccines. I checked their microchips and their paperwork prior to giving their vaccines. The AHC can only be issued more than three weeks after this rabies vaccination. The vet must be a registered official veterinary surgeonin order to be able to complete the certicate. The certicate cannot be issued until within  days of your travel from the UK date. Your vet needs to check your pet at this time.If you are travelling to Northern Ireland, Eire, Malta, Norway or Finland, your pet needs to be given medication against tapeworms between one and five days of you travelling. At Dunedin Vets, we combine this with the examination for the AHC.Each AHC is unique to your pet or pets. Up to five animals can travel on one certicate. The certicates are only valid for one journey from the UK. You have to state the country where you are entering the EU and there only certain designated ports or airports you can travel to. There is a specic AHC for each EU country and each one issued has its own unique certicate number, for your pet or pets. The AHC is valid for up to four months you mustto the UK before this time is up, but you can travel around EU countries during this time.These AHCs are long documents which have to be completed accurately with all the correct details, which owners have to provide in advance to the veterinary surgeon who completes them.If you are considering taking your pets to the EU this summer, contact your veterinary surgeon as soon as possible to ensure all the required paperwork is in order. We want to avoid disappointments at all costs.If you are wanting to travel further afield, contact DEFRA as soon as you know. A recent Export Health Certicate for dogs travelling to Dubai took almost six months to arrange.Plan in advance and hopefully everyone can have a lovely summer holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-park-new-home-french-sport-petanque","story":"Visitors to Lauderdale Park will be able to try their hand at the sport of petanque.The sport, which involves trying to score points by having boules closer to the target than the opponent, dates back more than  years.Now, after work between ious groups, a petanque piste has been created in the town, similar to that found in Haddington and North Berwick.Stuart McCombie, who has represented Scotland in petanque, is behind the idea to bring the sport to Dunbar.He said: “I used to play petanque many years ago at ious levels with ying degrees of success.“I retired to Dunbar three years ago and there are no petanque facilities within Dunbar.“For the last of couple of years, I have been playing in Haddington.“They have got a beautul piste set up beside the river and the church.“I play there with the UAand it was not until I moved here and joined that I was playing regularly again on a Wednesday.“They also play on a Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday and it is a long-established nice group of folk.“I looked round and North Berwick have got a small piste by the tennis courts but there’s nothing in Dunbar.”Dunbar already has its own French connection, having been twinned with the town of Lignieres for nearly  years.Discussions took place between Mr McCombie, Dunbar and District Twinning Association, Dunbar Community Council and Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership . An appeal was put out on social media to check levels of interest in the facility being created.Mr McCombie told the Courier he was “quite taken aback” by the feedback and decided to move forward with the plans.Funding was sourced from both the community council and DELAP, with work to create the piste in Lauderdale Park well under way.Mr McCombie said: “The building is near completion.“The piste is now almost up and running and I’ve had the first throw, just testing the surface.“It is a fantastic setting, a beautul setting. I did not think for a moment we would get inside the walled garden of Lauderdale Park.”Members of the public will be able to play the sport whenever there is not an organised event being held.Anyone without their own boules can hire them for £ – which covers everyone involved in the game – from the park’s cafe.Disabled access has also been created at the piste, with an official launch expected to coincide with Dunbar Civic Week, which runs from June  to  this year.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, was delighted to see the plans moving forward.She said: “Several dferent options were considered and the conclusion was Lauderdale Park was the best.“It is protected, it has a wall, a cafe, when children are playing in the garden the parents can play petanque.“The other big thing is that it is entirely accessible to anybody. Little kids can play, adults can play, disabled people can play and I just thought it was fun.”"},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-heading-east-lothian","story":"John Muir Country Park, near Dunbar, was converted into an -century battle camp on Sunday, with residents spotting rows of identical old-fashioned tents.Other period pieces were also spotted, including horse-drawn carts, cannons, old-fashioned woven bags for sand or grain and other smaller props.The area remains cordoned off to the public, with cast and crew not having arrived on the site as of yet.The period drama has become an international sensation, following the history of Scotland from the Highland clearances to the Jacobite rebellion and beyond.Actor Sam Heughan has been spotted filming already in Fe and Edinburgh, leading many to believe he will soon be visiting East Lothian as well.More details about what historical battle will be filmed in the county remain unknown, but locals will be hoping to get a glimpse of their favourite actors as they eagerly await the next instalment of the series."},{"url":null,"title":"met-office-easter-bank-holiday-scotland-weather-forecast","story":"It’s not all bad news though, the weather is set to clear up towards the weekend and it should certainly start to feel a little warmer than it has of late.While it might not be time to pack away your umbrella just yet, spring-like weather is on the way.If you havent already heard, its warming up in the run up to #Easter, but just how high will #temperatures climb  📈Find out in our updated weather for the week ahead 👇 pic EfHeVdpPIt is a rather wet and chilly start to the week rain is expected across most of Scotland today and tomorrow.

Potato crops damaged by dry weather, spiralling fertiliser costs and shortages of labour are expected to push prices upwards of  per cent this year.Overheads in the form of rates, taxes and minimum wage add a further challenge to profits.Now, due to the drastic and terrible situation in Eastern Europe, sunflower oil is becoming impossible to source and alternative, more expensive oils will need to be sourced.East Lothian rapeseed oil will command a good price and we can also expect to see fields of sunflowers in our county.All this has become a perfect storm for our chippies. Due to this extraordinary situation, their proven successful business model is threatened on several fronts. Many doubtthey can survive.The authorities should step up and pay attention. Help is needed to protect these local, well-loved assets that provide countless hot meals to our citizens every day.If something is not done, and business support organised, we may end up losing the very soul on our high streets.

Like … this big.” I pulled a rolling pin out of the cutlery drawer.“Lucky! And was he generous ”This confirms all men’s worst nightmares of how women describe these occasions.The full account of the previous evening’s exertions are outrageously funny and gloriously manky.In all the spilling and leaking and splashing, though, there’s humanity and compassion as one girl struggles through shame and self-doubt to find what everyone is looking for: love and a little tenderness.“I was really touched by the messages I was getting from other women when I first started posting my blogs. They were telling me that they’d been waiting for years for someone to describe how it really is for them in real le.“There was a time when people tended to be judgmental about dating websites, as though it was for desperadoes. But it’s totally mainstream now.”I ask herit’s not fraught with a greater degree of peril for women than it is for men. Are they taking a bigger risk Several of my female friends have relayed tales of meeting blokes who think that the simple act of agreeing to go on a date is a contractual guarantee of sex.“I’ve never agreed to date someone with whom I haven’t had a prolonged period of chatting beforehand. Therefore, you can usually tell who the roasters are. Are they over-affectionate or too complimentary about the way you look “Andyou’re only agreeing to have a coffee then that sets its own boundaries.“When I was younger I was probably quite naive about all of this, but you learn from experience. I think you can get a sense of someone from the way they dress and their chatthey’re bad news.“My friends call this ‘The f***-boy vibes’.”This is one of several revelatory locutions with which Sophie acquaints me during our conversation. I strive to appear knowledgeable and seasoned about all of this and affect an insouciant man-of-the-world vibe that soon crumbles.I’m treated to some other new concepts. One of these is “dropping a pin”.Sophie explains this is a safety mechanism where her friends can electronically embed her location on their smartphones in case anything untoward unfolds.Another one is the “Tinder-walk”. This, Sophie explains, became one of the big features of Scotland in lockdown while people like me were watching old football videos and trying to decipher cookery books.Yet this Tinder-walk malarkey possesses a reassuringly vintage aesthetic. “Everyone got a dog and went on Tinder walks during lockdown,” she says. “It helped to ease us all through the social restrictions and was a way of keeping the flames of romance enkindled.”Heather Suttie, the Scottish events and PR specialist, was thrilled when she first read A Glasgow Kiss. “It just seemed to be what a lot of us had been waiting for,” she said. “I can’t remember laughing so much at a book – and crying too.“It’s just so honest and it could only have been written by a Glaswegian because it’s got that honesty and directness that’s usually missing from fiction that deals with sex and relationships.”Suttie is founder of BookFace, an international, online book club that holds monthly events in Glasgow with modern authors. “When Sophie appeared at one last month the response from women and men was overwhelmingly positive. Yes, some of the scenes are outrageously graphic, but they’re leavened with humour and honesty.”There are several astonishing aspects to A Glasgow Kiss. It’s been written by a first-time author who had not the remotest idea of how to break into the publishing world and yet has secured her a two-book deal featuring the further adventures of Zara.And as well as hitting top spot in the Erotic Fiction charts, Waterstone’s made it one of their books of the year. Yet, she’s still looking for a literary agent.Perhaps the most startling is that Sophie wrote the book while juggling the demands of being a full-time nurse in a busy Glasgow hospital during lockdown with the responsibilities of being a single mother to two children.“I didn’t really stop to think about that,” she said. “Writing the book probably helped me cope during the pandemic.”And while the majority of the responses to the book have been from women, quite a few blokes responded too.“I can honestly say that all the responses from men, including from some former internet dates, have been very positive. They all got the humour.“One messaged me last night and said: ‘F*** me, it was like reading an old scuddy mag when I was a lad. If you ever feel like ditching the halo just give me a shout and I’ll take you out’. I mean, where did he even get his hands on the book ”Any worries she may have harboured about the reactions of friends and family were ill founded.“I’d only initially told a few of them and they were all so supportive. I was a bit more anxious about my family’s reaction, to be honest.“They’re all pretty committed and traditional west of Scotland Catholics, but my mum says she’s very proud of me. She hasn’t read it and I don’t really want her to. But she knows what it’s about. And my family have also said that, of all of them, I was the one with no filters.“I recently bumped into one of my gran’s friends, a woman in her s. She waved over and said: ‘I bought your book. I sat down with it at  o’clock last week and I didn’t stop til am.’ And she’s the holiest wee woman ever. She’s lovely.“And then she said: ‘Your granny would have been so proud of you’. “I was also a bit worried about how it might be received at my workplace. And then I saw that some of my patients were reading it. One of them was sitting in our dialysis unit reading it and asked me to come over and sign it for her.”Recently, on the gogglebox, there have been some howlers posing as provocative television drama that are about as edgy as Classic FM.You find yourself unconsciously casting A Glasgow Kiss even as you’re reading it, as it’s perfect for a six-part comedy drama. The second book in the series will be published in August and by then Sophie hopes to have found an agent.There’s a message from the author at the front of the book. It says simply: “This book is for any girl who has ever wondered why she isn’t enough.“Just open your eyes and raise your standards. I see you.”l A Glasgow Kiss, by Sophie Gravia, is published in paperback by Orion Books, £..It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Regulatory organizations such as the FCA, FINRA, ASIC, and FinCEN all assure complete transparency and investor security.And while security is top-notch, eToro’s biggest advantage is the fee system. You won’t be charged any transaction fees when opening a trade since the  incorporates a spread-based system.The ’s interface is user-friendly and even complete beginners can quickly learn how to navigate it, while the signup process is pretty straightforward and it only takes a couple of minutes to open up an account.Lastly, eToro also offers a wide iety of features.

However, traders that want to speed things up and skip the exchange in the buying process will be charged a bit more .One of the main reasons why buying Bitcoin with PayPal on Binance is a bit more complicated is because it has to go through the PP trading service.

No UK or EU investor protection.With PayPal becoming more favourable towards Bitcoin in the previous year, there are numerous new benefits introduced that traders can take advantage of.Here are some of the main ones that we found to be the most important.One of the main benefits of PayPal is that users can deposit and withdraw funds in their accounts in a timely fashion.In the volatile crypto market where changes occur each second, having the ability to make instant deposits is of utmost importance. It will help you capture profitable trade opportunities as soon as they emerge.Additionally, fund withdrawals are also rather quick and most exchanges can process them in a day. This is very impressive considering that credit debit card withdrawals can sometimes last up to ten business days.Another impressive PayPal feature that attracts investors is the high level of security.

Customer confidentiality is also guaranteed with the data protection compliance and ‘key pinning’.Additionally, users receive an email each time they make a transaction, which means that evensomeone does manage to breach your account, PayPal will quickly be on their tracks.Lastly, PayPal employs a professional security team that keeps an eye on all payments   andthey notice anything suspicious, you will be notied.Buying Bitcoin with PayPal is a pretty simple and straightforward process – even total beginners can get the hang of it by following a few steps.This is mostly due to the user-friendly interface that PayPal incorporates, which makes navigation extremely easy.Once you have enough funds in your PayPal account, linking it to a crypto exchange should be a piece of cake and you will only be a few clicks away from acquiring your first bit of Bitcoin.One of PayPal’s features that often goes overlooked is the exceptional mobile app.You won’t have to worry about having your laptop with you at all times, by using the mobile app you will be able to make trades even when you’re on the move.Since your payment option will already be linked to your PayPal account, you won’t even need your credit debit cards with you.PayPal supports  fiat currencies, including some of the most popular ones like GBP, USD, CAD, EUR, and AUD.

This is something that was recently introduced and only US and UK-based users have this option.PayPal allows you to instantly purchase BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC for .However, while this may seem like a great opportunity at first, there are a lot of drawbacks and limitations that come with it.First of all, traders don’t have the option to move the purchased crypto to other s. This means that evenyou do buy Bitcoin through PayPal, you won’t be able to transfer it to any external wallets.This isn’t really an ideal situation.Most experienced traders keep their BTC and other currencies in high-quality crypto wallets with cold storage, mainly due to security reasons – PayPal doesn’t allow you to do this.Next, the fee structure on PayPal isn’t very competitive, especially when compared to the leading crypto exchanges. Buying - worth of BTC comes with a .% fixed fee that is charged on both sides of the trade.What this means is that there is a chance that you will have to pay .% transaction fees when trading Bitcoin, plus the currency conversion fees that are charged during withdrawals.After taking all of these factors into consideration, it’s evident that buying Bitcoin with PayPal is much more profitableyou do it through a regulated crypto exchange.Aside from the lower fees, crypto exchanges offer a wide iety of trading features that can be immensely useful.

For working we listen to jazz and soundtracks – mostly instrumental stuff. Sun Ra has a special place: even his le story is fascinating. Running the Arkestra meant providing structure for lots of musicians, keeping them healthy too. His DIY approach is interesting, like an early punk, only jazz. Chet Baker is another artist that we always go back to. His music has such a beautul feel to it, and the phrasing is incredible, whether on trumpet or voice. A real emotional depth.We grew up in dferent countries and dferent decades but found we had listened to a lot of the same records. For example, we love Moondog and also Morricone, and recently we’ve been tuning in to Harold Budd. But sometimes at the end of the day we’ll blast something to change our headspace. The Homosexuals made records that are really great – innovative and timeless. In fact, the late s and early s were very fertile periods. Sandra took the time to make a pastel drawing of Mark E. Smith, to celebrate his le and the music of The Fall.CINEMAIt probably isn’t too surprising, given that we make comics and that’s visual storytelling, but we watch a lot of films. Hitchcock is a favourite – we can re-watch his films repeatedly and always find something new to appreciate. Bergman is incredible, and his work isn’t always necessarily bleak. Fanny and Alexander is a masterpiece weto annually. It has a great atmosphere. Last year we watched a bunch of oneiric films, like Jan Nemec’s debut, Diamonds of the Night or The Hourglass Sanitorium, directed by Wojciech Jerzy Has, because we are interested in pure cinema and these films are unusually structured too. Some of them are downright trippy and strange like The Saragossa Manuscript.BOOKSSandra Marrs and John Chalmers, aka Metaphrog The Manuscript Found in Saragossa is an amazing piece of literature. Seems very modern still. We read a lot, particularly recently with the pandemic and lockdowns – it’s calming and almost like an antidote to all the flashing screens of modern le. Deep in a Dream: The Long Night of Chet Baker by James Gavin is a great read, almost supernatural in its power. While Straight Le by Art and Laurie Pepper is remarkable too: the writing has an incredible tone and almost painful honesty. It really is brilliant: up there with James Baldwin. We love his books, particularly Another Country. Both of us re-read The Secret History by Donna Tartt last month because we like the book so much. Vladimir Nabokov is a favourite – not only because of the way he interrogates the form of the novel but also because he writes so beautully. He also composed poetry and chess problems, and we hid a couple of those in our Louis books.COMICSIn the world of comics and graphic novels we both love Love and Rockets by the Hernandez brothers: Gilbert, Jaime, and Mario. And, we love Daniel Clowes, Jacques Tardi, Ben Katchor, Charles Burns and also Chris Ware.One thing we really missed in the last two years was access to art galleries and museums – it’s great to be able to visit those again. Frida Kahlo is a favourite and Sandra enjoyed doing a pastel portrait of her last year.The Graphic Novel World of Metaphrog at the Park Gallery in Callendar House, Falkirk closes on SundayIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

At the time, UEFA told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans’ views would be centre stage in deciding what came next.“So it is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year ‘UEFA Club Co-efficient’.“These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games.”UEFA’s executive committee initially approved reforms to its men’s club competitions, including the Champions League, on April  last year, but to very little fanfare or publicity as it happened in the hours after the Super League had been launched.The increase from six matches to , plus a further play-off round to determine eight of the last , along with the inclusion of two-co-efficient places were approved at that time. The group stage would increase from  to  teams, with all teams playing in one big league and facing other teams under a seeded ‘Swiss system’.UEFA has looked at the plans again in the wake of the Super League collapse, however the proposals clearly still provide far too many concessions to the big clubs in the view of Premier League fans.Under its latest proposal, teams could only qualy via the co-efficientthey finished immediately outside the regular Champions League spots, to avoid them leapfrogging rivals who finish in a higher position. However, it is understood teams could also win the FA Cup and qualy via co-efficient, whereas FA Cup winners with a lesser European pedigree would not. vw,vw,px, px\"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin “It is irresponsible and out of touch to even consider doubling the number of home games that fans will have to attend before the last - knock-out round begins,” the Network added.“This will be compounded by the cost of living crisis that is hitting Europe. Furthermore, we do not see how increasing the requirement for teams and fans to fly around Europe is compatible with UEFA’s environmental commitments.“Premier League fans do not want  group games involving a small cartel of rich clubs further distorting competitive balance. We want strong, competitive domestic leagues, an equal opportunity for all to qualy for UEFA competitions based on sporting merit, along with a fairer distribution of the game’s wealth from the revenues those competitions earn.“Last year we engaged in constructive discussions with UEFA President Ceferin who made a commitment that fans would be listened to in this process. Our collective voice is unied and our position clear.“We call on UEFA to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family.”European Leagues, the umbrella group which includes the Premier League among its membership, has sought since the beginning of the consultation to limit the increase in matches to eight rather than , and to grant the two extra Champions League qualication places to the domestic champions of countries not currently represented in the group stage, rather than on club co-efficient."},{"url":null,"title":"baby-sloth-takes-keepers-surprise-zoo   \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4576366.jpg--.jpg?1649424170000\n","title":"daria through to miss ni final","story":"A former pupil of Patricks College in Ballymena has made it through to the final of the Miss Northern Ireland competition.Daria Gapska, a -year-old childrens nursing student, recently ed to the college for a presentation to Year  on her chosen charity Braveheartsni.Daria was one of two finalists to be crowned at the first live Miss World Northern Ireland Heat of  in Nu Delhi, Belfast in front of an an astute judging  which included Managing Director of ACA models and Event organiser Victoria Withers.

Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.

Just as he could never accept the fact that I was party leader as a WOMAN and he continuously agitated against me. Jim is still living in the s - sad but there it is. Mrs Foster said voters in South Down have a choice to select principled, able, active representation in Diane Forsythe.

Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.”Mr Wells, meanwhile, arranged a photo-call with Mr McKee and the TUV leader on Monday. Former Ulster Unionist Mr McKee said he was delighted and honoured to have Mr Wells’ support.“In the end he was abandoned by his own party but it is the mark of the man that he wishes the best for South Down going forward,” added Mr McKee who quit the UUP for the TUV last October over the more liberal approach of Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie and his party’s stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for a ban on gay conversion therapy.He added: “I am delighted to have Jim’s support and gratied that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.” TUV leader Mr Allister also joined in welcoming Jim Wells’ support but there was no comment on the prospect of him joining Mr McKee in the TUV ranks.“At critical times in Stormont Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right,” Mr Allister said.“In December  we were the only MLAs to speak and vote against  EU regulations essential to bedding in the iniquitous Protocol.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”Mr Allister insisted the Wells backing would bolster the chances of Mr McKee in the tightly-fought constituency where unionist isions could hand the last of the five seats to Alliance or the SDLP.“In strengthening Harold McKee’s hand he is laying the foundation for the continuance in Stormont of South Down representation based on conviction politics. We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist Party PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI Protocol PremiumJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateUnionist councillors brand good relations group ‘a waste of time’ PremiumViewpointOpinionCouncillors stand their ground with the BatmanMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelPret A Manger to open in Northern Ireland with plans for  jobs on islandJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlayShots fired in Durrow Park in Derry overnight PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM Latest Northern IrelandJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsPSNI contacts ombudsman over Jody Keenan death in NewryCo Tyrone fth most profitable UK place to host an AirbnbShots fired by masked men in ‘brazen and dangerous’ act in Derry’s Bogside areaLatestSex-offender whose defence pointed to ‘recognised side-effects’ of medication admits chargesJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentWatch: Sneak peak as Kenneth Branagh and Caitriona Balfe discuss Belfast in DVD extraRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsPSNI contacts ombudsman over Jody Keenan death in Newry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amenities are to include private balconies, shared courtyards and shared roof terraces. Some  units are to be social housing.Lacuna Developments, Titanic Quarter Ltd and Belfast Harbour have teamed up with Welsh firm Watkin Jones Group for the development, which will be called ‘Loft Lines’.It will be a mix of private rented and social apartments, alongside recreational spaces, gyms and children’s play area. Loft Lines will also include a public area with a sports park for outdoor events and exercise classes called South Yard Square, while there will also be space for a coffee shop, restaurant and creche.According to planning documents submitted on behalf of the applicants: “The proposals describe a new, contemporary and sustainable residential development that is rooted in the qualities and history of the place and declares its future as an iconic waterfront neighbourhood. We want to express the three blocks as a cluster of urban objects around a new square. We believe each should have its own distinct qualities, derived from how it responds to its specic site and programmatic conditions, but should also feel related to its neighbours.“Dferent but the same. This ‘urban assembly’ has the potential to rest confidently on a prime site within the city — a backdrop to the river. This will be arguably the first mixed use, mixed tenure residential development in this area of the city, providing much needed homes for people of all ages and backgrounds.“A mix of social and affordable housing , alongside build to rentis proposed delivering a choice by providing ,  and  bedroom apartments and studios for rent, alongside social and affordable accommodation to meet a range of needs.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up According to a briefing document prepared for members of Belfast City Council’s planning committee, consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and Belfast City Airport have no objection to the proposals, subject to conditions.The document states the development would cost around £m and generate an estimated  full-time equivalent construction jobs over three years.“The three buildings are referred to as Blocks ,  and a. Blocks  and a are proposed for Build to Rentblocks whilst Block  is proposed for social housingwith the remainder being managed by the Housing Association for private rental. An area of the sitewould be dedicated as a public square ,” the briefing paper reads.“It is further estimated that non-residential uses at the proposed development will require a total of  gross direct FTEjobs on-site to support commercial community operations in the retail, professional services, health and care and hospitality sectors. The application is accompanied by an Environmental Assessment which concludes that subject to appropriate mitigation, the negative impactswhich could arise from the developments are either negligible or are not signicant.”To date, the planning application has attracted six letters of support and nine objections. BCC planners have recommended the application for approval, subject to conditions.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilDepartment for InfrastructureGeorge Best City AirportMore On Belfast City CouncilRocking the ballot box: Brian Smyth, Sian O’Neill and Paul Doherty entered politics through music activism PremiumLandscape architect Joy Hutchinson to retire after catching the eye with her designs PremiumRevealed:  senior NI council staff received over £k in pay packetsBelfast City Council looking to establish Poverty Commission amid cost of living crisisOverflowing bins leading to ‘health crisis’ for residents in HolylandMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelPret A Manger to open in Northern Ireland with plans for  jobs on islandJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlayShots fired in Durrow Park in Derry overnight PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM Latest Northern IrelandJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsCo Tyrone fth most profitable UK place to host an AirbnbShots fired by masked men in ‘brazen and dangerous’ act in Derry’s Bogside areaPolice probe after shots fired by masked man in LondonderryLatestSex-offender whose defence pointed to ‘recognised side-effects’ of medication admits chargesJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentWatch: Sneak peak as Kenneth Branagh and Caitriona Balfe discuss Belfast in DVD extraRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough councillors approve own pay rise, with mayor due to receive the biggest hike in payment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The seat, which they lost in , is being actively targeted in next month’s poll.Their candidate there, Paul Doherty, is a Turf Lodge native who runs the local food bank. The SDLP are hoping that, during a cost-of-living crisis, he will be the man to snatch back those lost votes.Party leader Colum Eastwood pointed to the toxicity that has marred the first few weeks of the election campaign.Mr Doherty was threatened while putting up posters in the Shankill, but Mr Eastwood said his party were putting the “cost-of-living crisis” front and centre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSDLP party leader Colum Eastwood, West Belfast candidate Paul Doherty, former SDLP politician Dr Joe Hendron, North Belfast candidate Nichola Mallon and South Belfast MP Claire Hanna“People don’t have the time to worry about all the shenanigans at Stormont, about who is going to be first or deputy first minister. The vast majority of people are really struggling and really annoyed that politicians were willing to walk away when they can’t heat their homes or fill up their car,” he said.“We have the best possible candidate: Paul Doherty is feeding  families a week he is a genuine community activist.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Dr Joe Hendron, the former MP for west Belfast, showed up at the launch in the Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich, the Irish language cultural hub on the Falls Road, on Monday morning to offer support for the launch.At  years of age, he is SDLP royalty, a veteran of the party who knows what it’s like to battle Sinn Féin at the polls.The Belfast West MP between  and , he lost his Westminster seat to Gerry Adams and it has stayed in Sinn Féin’s hands ever since.When a tearful Alex Attwood declared he had “let his party down” when he lost his Assembly seat in , he would have been aware that once the party relinquish a seat in west Belfast, the chances of taking it back are remote.Mr Attwood’s loss was a direct result of the number of MLAs being cut from  to .With four Sinn Féin MLAs and one People Before Profit ed in , the SDLP know they can’t take out Mr Carroll, who has a safe personal vote.Instead, they will be targeting that fourth Sinn Féin seat, potentially at the expense of newcomer Aisling Reilly.An upbeat Mr Eastwood, while not stating numbers, pointed not just to nationalist west Belfast as a possible gain, but Strangford, where the transfer-friendly Conor Houston is a first-time candidate.He also called for tactical voting, saying borrowed votes in Upper Bann could help Dolores Kelly take out DUP veteran and former minister Diane Dodds.The party will also be battling to keep their seat in Lagan Valley, where Pat Catney is under severe pressure from the DUP.“I don’t think they can take him out,” said Eastwood of Catney, a former pub landlord who is one of the party’s more colourful characters.“In Derry we are in the hunt for a third seat. Places like South Antrim, Fermanagh and South Tyrone, these are places where people need to think about tactics,” added Mr Eastwood.“In Upper Bann, for example, Dolores Kelly is [battling] with Diane Dodds for the last seat. If a few people lent us their vote I think we could take Diane Dodds out.“This is not about who the first minister is, as I think that’s already been decided, it is about how many DUP are left in the Executive — and we’d prefer there were fewer.”The loyalist anti-protocol rallies have so far dominated the discourse around the election.There was a round of applause from the party faithful when the Foyle MP said that those who placed a poster with a noose around the neck of the UUP leader in Lurgan at the weekend “couldn’t lace Doug Beattie’s boots”.“This campaign has got off to a fairly bad start. The tone hasn’t been good, our posters have been burned, our canvassers have been threatened, Paul [Doherty] was himself threatened on the Shankill Road and was back the next day handing out food parcels,” added Mr Eastwood.“I am convinced that those determined to drag this place back will fail.“I would say to ordinary unionist people: I don’t think the DUP, for example, will have your best interests at heart. They are the people who delivered Brexit, they delivered the protocol, they trusted Boris Johnson.“People are entitled to protest, %, but with every right comes responsibility and they have to be responsible for the impact. And we’ve seen Doug Beattie being threatened, our people have been threatened — I’m not sure how that’s going to deliver and [effect] change to the protocol.”Related topicsSDLPColum EastwoodSinn FéinPat CatneyDemocratic Unionist PartyDolores KellyBoris JohnsonDoug BeattieMore On SDLPAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-song PremiumViewpointOpinionDivisions still exist within unionismUnionists snub group which aims to improve cross-community relationsNorthern Ireland Assembly election: Who will top the poll in your constituency and whose seat is at risk How Northern Ireland’s electoral system will prevent any landslide victoriesMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelPret A Manger to open in Northern Ireland with plans for  jobs on islandJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlayShots fired in Durrow Park in Derry overnight PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter ‘shocked’ after group of men claim she was ‘the IRA’ in attempt to intimidate her while canvassingFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidatePastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songLatestSex-offender whose defence pointed to ‘recognised side-effects’ of medication admits chargesJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentWatch: Sneak peak at Kenneth Branagh and Caitriona Balfe discussing Belfast in DVD extraRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough councillors approve own pay rise, with mayor due to receive the biggest hike in payment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Press EyeLisa SmythTwitterApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP has defended the low number of female candidates it is running in next month’s Assembly elections.With just a quarter of women making its list of candidates, the DUP has the lowest number of females in the running for election out of Northern Ireland’s five main political parties.By contrast, % of Sinn Fein candidates are women, followed by the Alliance Party, where half of its runners are female. The SDLP is next, with % of candidates women, while a third of the UUP’s runners are female.The DUP’s South Down candidate has rejected accusations of gender bias and said the party does not run females as a tick box exercise.Diane Forsythe, who has replaced Jim Wells as the DUP’s candidate after  years at Stormont, said: “I am an accountant and mother of three young children.“I am the only DUP candidate in this constituency.“A lot of parties field female candidates in seats where they have little chance of winning or they field women as a second candidate but then ide the area in way which makes it very dficult for the female candidate to win. This shouldn’t be about tokenism. The DUP run female candidates in seats where we can win.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ms Forsythe also pointed out the fact that the DUP was the first major party to have a female leader and female First Minister.“We want to see more females in politics but it should be on merit rather not than tokenism,” she added.Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie said ensuring more women represent the party at Stormont remains a priority and that efforts will continue to increase the number of female UUP MLAs.“When I took over as leader of the UUP in May last year, I made it one of my absolute priorities to encourage more female candidates to come forward,” he said.“We have not yet reached where I want us to be — % of our Assembly candidates are female, but I desperately want this to increase at the next Assembly elections.“They may have been selected, but the most important thing now is getting them elected alongside their male colleagues, so that we have a base to build on for the future.“We are on a journey and I want to bring about further change as we head towards next year`s council elections and every election after that.”Mr Beattie said he wants the make-up of his party to “reflect society”.He continued: “Diversity and inclusion can only increase the strength of any organisation. We need more role models and I hope that the exceptional candidates we are standing at this election will be future leaders in our party and society.“We are not yet there yet, but I am absolutely committed to taking us in the right direction.”Connie Egan, who is running for the Alliance Party in North Down, welcomed the gender make-up of her party’s candidates which she said had happened without a quota being set. However, she said more needs to be done to tackle sexism faced by female candidates: “We each have a role to play in ensuring we continue to encourage more women to participate.”Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartySDLPAlliance PartyNorthern Ireland AssemblyJim WellsDoug BeattieMore On Democratic Unionist PartyFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidate PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI Protocol PremiumJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateUnionist councillors brand good relations group ‘a waste of time’Most Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelPret A Manger to open in Northern Ireland with plans for  jobs on islandJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlayShots fired in Durrow Park in Derry overnight PlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter ‘shocked’ after group of men claim she was ‘the IRA’ in attempt to intimidate her while canvassingFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidatePastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songLatestSex-offender whose defence pointed to ‘recognised side-effects’ of medication admits chargesJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentWatch: Sneak peak at Kenneth Branagh and Caitriona Balfe discussing Belfast in DVD extraRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough councillors approve own pay rise, with mayor due to receive the biggest hike in payment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down.

We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist PartyFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidate PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolUnionist councillors brand good relations group ‘a waste of time’ PremiumViewpointOpinionCouncillors stand their ground with the BatmanMost Read‘Beautul and kind-hearted’: Newry woman Jody Keenandied waiting for an ambulance from BelfastAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson is now at the mercy of loyalist angerCharity fight event in Belfast marred by violence outside hotelPret A Manger to open in Northern Ireland with plans for  jobs on islandJim Wells faces the boot from DUP for endorsing TUV candidateTop VideosPlayPolice attend fatal road collison on Toome BypassPlayCCTV shows moment device is detonated at Ballysillan ATM PlayShots fired in Durrow Park in Derry overnight Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP’s Cara Hunter ‘shocked’ after group of men claim she was ‘the IRA’ in attempt to intimidate her while canvassingFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidatePastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From mysterious rally organisers and a problem in East Antrim to an SDLP sing-songColum Eastwood urges people to vote tactically and lend SDLP their vote, as he launches election campaignLatestSex-offender whose defence pointed to ‘recognised side-effects’ of medication admits chargesJody Keenan’s death reported to Police Ombudsman for assessmentWatch: Sneak peak at Kenneth Branagh and Caitriona Balfe discussing Belfast in DVD extraRelatives of two people killed during NI conflict lose legal battle against UK Government’s ban on Troubles-era prosecutionsAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough councillors approve own pay rise, with mayor due to receive the biggest hike in payment,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a

Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males.

In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityEuropean football’s governing body and its president Aleksander Ceferin praised supporters for their role in thwarting attempts to form a European Super League almost a year ago.However, those same fans feel new proposals from UEFA to increase the number of Champions League group stage matches from six to  from  and to reserve two qualication berths based on historic European performance rather than domestic achievement will create a “cartel” of rich clubs and damage domestic competitions.The Football Supporters’ Association’s Premier League Network says these proposals should be rejected by UEFA, whose ruling executive committee is expected to make a final decision on the Champions League revamp in Vienna on May .Fan groups from the FSA’s Premier League Network met last night  were unanimous in opposition to UEFA’s proposed Champions League changes that will entrench the richest clubs, damage the football pyramid  rip off fans.The FSA supports their stance.https:t.co pZvHOmGBlH pic ZDeSVNwy— The FSAApril , “We are united in opposition to proposals to reform the Champions League that are a back door attempt at ato the discredited idea of a European Super League,” the Network’s statement said.“Last year, it was our supporter groups that united to force the collapse of the European Super League. At the time, UEFA told us that fans were the heart of the game and promised fans’ views would be centre stage in deciding what came next.“So it is with great dismay that we now face the prospect of changes to the Champions League that will mean many more group games being played and entry for some clubs being based on a historical five-year ‘UEFA Club Co-efficient’..remove“These proposals will only widen the gap between rich clubs and the rest, at the same time wrecking domestic league calendars, with the expectation that fans sacrice yet more time and money attending meaningless group games.”UEFA’s executive committee initially approved reforms to its men’s club competitions, including the Champions League, on April  last year, but to very little fanfare or publicity as it happened in the hours after the Super League had been launched.The increase from six matches to , plus a further play-off round to determine eight of the last , along with the inclusion of two-co-efficient places were approved at that time. The group stage would increase from  to  teams, with all teams playing in one big league and facing other teams under a seeded ‘Swiss system’.UEFA has looked at the plans again in the wake of the Super League collapse, however the proposals clearly still provide far too many concessions to the big clubs in the view of Premier League fans.Under its latest proposal, teams could only qualy via the co-efficientthey finished immediately outside the regular Champions League spots, to avoid them leapfrogging rivals who finish in a higher position. However, it is understood teams could also win the FA Cup and qualy via co-efficient, whereas FA Cup winners with a lesser European pedigree would not. vw,vw,px, px\"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin “It is irresponsible and out of touch to even consider doubling the number of home games that fans will have to attend before the last - knock-out round begins,” the Network added.“This will be compounded by the cost of living crisis that is hitting Europe. Furthermore, we do not see how increasing the requirement for teams and fans to fly around Europe is compatible with UEFA’s environmental commitments.“Premier League fans do not want  group games involving a small cartel of rich clubs further distorting competitive balance. We want strong, competitive domestic leagues, an equal opportunity for all to qualy for UEFA competitions based on sporting merit, along with a fairer distribution of the game’s wealth from the revenues those competitions earn.“Last year we engaged in constructive discussions with UEFA President Ceferin who made a commitment that fans would be listened to in this process. Our collective voice is unied and our position clear.“We call on UEFA to demonstrate that it acts in the interests of the wider football community and its supporters, not just the interests of the few rich investors and state-owned clubs that, less than a year ago, tried to destroy the European football family.”European Leagues, the umbrella group which includes the Premier League among its membership, has sought since the beginning of the consultation to limit the increase in matches to eight rather than , and to grant the two extra Champions League qualication places to the domestic champions of countries not currently represented in the group stage, rather than on club co-efficient..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UEFA accused of being out of touch with fans over Champions League proposals article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"PSNI investigating theft of much-loved working sheepdogs   Toome bypass tragedy: police release name of crash victimNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

The eagerly anticipated successor to the popular Barrys Amusements opened its doors for the first time on Saturday amid great excitement. Hundreds of people young and old filed through the doors all afternoon as the magic ed to Portmagic - and just in time for Easter. The good news is that Currys is now up and running, boasting all the old Barrys favourites and adding some new ones too. And for those with old Barrys tokens - no, you cant use them, but you can help the RNLI by dropping them into collection boxes dotted around the complex. The fun park has chosen the charity as its partner - a thoughtful gesture given the important work volunteers do in the waters off the north coast. But for now, after two years of zero craic because of the pandemic, all roads lead to the Port and what promises to be a fun-filled holiday period. Happy days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbbdabfbfeeff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afbaeecfba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649684275157.jpg--april_showers__keep_them_shorter_.jpg?164968427500","title":"april showers keep them shorter ","story":"Spring has finally sprung and with rising energy costs there is no better time to dust off old habits and create some new ones that are good for your pocket and the environment. Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.
