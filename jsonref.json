according to another source - it has been \u0027too slow\u0027 and forced the Government to intervene to take over some of its functions.And the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which was set up at the beginning of June and determines the UK\u0027s COVID-19 alert level, was reportedly established to do the job PHE should have been doing.The Telegraph added that the Treasury under Chancellor Rishi Sunak is reviewing plans about whether or not plans for a new PHE base in Harlow, Essex, should go ahead.Mr Johnson\u0027s comments came in a speech in which he vowed to move on from the coronavirus crisis with a package of spending measures.Relaunching his Government, the Prime Minister pledged to bring forward \u0027the most radical reforms of our planning system since the end of the Second World War\u0027.He said the move, which will see ministers take the axe to swathes of red tape, would pave the way for an \u0027infrastructure revolution\u0027 that would create jobs now and improve productivity long-term.Mr Johnson said the Government wanted to \u0027build, build, build\u0027, but added that he would \u0027build back better, build back greener, build back faster.\u0027Chancellor Rishi Sunak will lead a new unit, dubbed \u0027Project Speed\u0027 to fast track major infrastructure projects and identify bottlenecks in the system that need to be cleared away.The Prime Minister hinted that he would also take the bulldozer to parts of the Whitehall machine, saying he had been frustrated by its \u0027sluggish\u0027 response to the coronavirus pandemic.Families who\u0027ve lost loved ones to coronavirus are preparing legal action against the Government over claims they would not have died had ministers locked down the country sooner, it was reported last night.Around 1,000 grieving relatives say the Government \u0027gambled\u0027 with people\u0027s lives when they failed to act quickly enough or heed the warnings from other countries as Covid-19 tore across Europe.They also want an investigation into the flawed testing regime, the levels of protective clothing that was available and other issues surrounding planning for the pandemic.The group has engaged lawyers for advice, are petitioning for a public inquiry and have demanded a meeting with the Prime Minister and Health Secretary.Jo Goodman, spokesman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, whose father, Stuart, 72, contracted the virus the week before lockdown and died on April 2, said she was \u0027appalled\u0027 that the Government had so far \u0027blanked\u0027 their request to meet.Heat on Public Health England as Prime Minister admits coronavirus response was \u0027sluggish\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/058b47cc4daa45259e594e1d960b8c0000a4b0de/0_415_7703_4621/master/7703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937ca3be28d72135e2fc3399855a9071","title":"its made a difference to the family the children going back to school","story":"As primary and secondary schools put measures in place for a partial return, staff, parents and pupils explain to Rosie Mullender how they are adaptingHome schooling has become the new normal for millions of children across the UK. And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.Tasked with handling the deceased before taking measurements for their coffins,the volume of work the technicians faced was staggering, he says. “In a normal 24-hour period in hospital you’d have one or two deaths occurring – not including people arriving in ambulances. At the spike, they were receiving 20 a day, sometimes more. I can’t imagine how the technicians did it before we got there.”Any discomfort Murray initially felt was quickly put into perspective. “At first it was horrible and one guy had to leave because he didn’t like it, understandably. Then I thought: ‘Well someone’s got to do it.’” But having previously suffered from depression and PTSD, friends questioned whether the role was a good fit. “People were asking me if it would be good for my mental health and I thought: ‘Well, it is, because I’m doing something.’ If the bodies had suspected covid, we’d put them into sealed coffins, which meant families didn’t even get to see them. I kept thinking: ‘I’m the last person who’s going to see them’, which gave me a sense of purpose and duty, like I was doing something worthwhile. It felt like I was helping my country, really, just as I did in the marines. At least I could make sure they were looked after.”Murray is one of a growing number of veterans who have lent their support during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Johnny Mercer, minister for defence, people and veterans, says: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”To date, Re:Act has deployed more than 200 volunteers and has helped to ensure 2,700 deceased patients have been cared for, 1,000 hospital beds have been installed and 5.4m PPE items distributed.Now Murray wants to share his experience so we can learn from it. “People need to know that Covid-19 kills people and if you don’t act sensibly, it’s going to happen again. I can see people out and about already forgetting and it can be frustrating when you’ve seen what I’ve seen,” he says.He is passionate about ensuring the work of the mortuary technicians – like the doctors, nurses and supermarket workers before them – is talked about. “Those technicians were on their own before we arrived. I dedicate everything I do to them, they were absolutely amazing, brave and cheerful. That’s the commando ethos – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. They’re incredibly brave, doing a job nobody wants to do.”But while many veterans are volunteering for the first time, Murray is no stranger to this work. After leaving the marines – where he specialised in Arctic warfare – he turned to security and close protection services, running his own surveillance business until last year. “It was a horrible world, but one of the last jobs I did was for an animal rights company,” he explains. “I remember thinking: ‘I’m doing something worthwhile – I’m helping animals and using my skills.’’’ It led Murray to change tack completely, leaving behind his successful business. “I thought: ‘I can’t go back to that world, I’m going to do good,’” he says.Having suffered from poor mental health after leaving the marines, Murray explains he attempted to take his own life five years ago. It meant he was put in touch with armed forces charity Rock2Recovery, which sparked a friendship with Dan Elliot. “I went to hospital and they helped me get back on my feet,” he says. “I formed a friendship with Dan, who is an amazing guy. You can’t put a finger on how many lives that man has saved. I’ve lost four close friends to suicide in the past four years and I’ve been in hospital in various states of PTSD or depression, whatever you want to call it,” he says.Murray’s involvement with the charity – and his friendship with Elliot – opened his eyes to the volume of military and blue light workers also suffering from poor mental health. Now in a stable, healthy place, Murray devotes his time to connecting withthese workers via social media, where he shares videos about his experiences. “There are thousands of people who want help,” he says. “I tell them about my problems and we speak for hours – they’ll call me at night to talk. Many of them have never opened up to anyone before.”They meet in person, too. Having discovered the Wim Hof method – which combines cold-water exposure, breathing techniques and meditation, and Murray credits with saving his life – he invites veterans and those still serving to visit his home in the Peak District, sharing the vital skills and techniques. “They drive hundreds of miles and I take them to the river and we do Wim Hof breathing and jump in the river,” he says. “I’ve had lads and girls saying: ‘You’ve saved my life.’ I think it shows young people that suicide is not the answer and that you can come through the other side. I’m starting to live my life now and I’ve never felt so alive. It saved me, so I teach it.”While his role in the mortuaries has come to an end, Murray is still volunteering with Re:Act, with his latest job safely housing homeless people in nearby St Helens. “I believe this is what I was supposed to do – helping people. It’s my calling”, he says, when asked why he’s doing it. “I think by doing good things and by volunteering, it helps them and it helps me. I also hope that by teaching – and showing people through doing – that they might volunteer more. I’m confident we’ll find positives during this terrible time.”Next, Murray plans to buy a camper van to travel throughout Britain, visiting members of the armed forces, blue light workers and now, mortuary technicians too, to further spread his message and teach the breathing techniques he practises daily. His hope for the country is simple: “During Covid-19, I noticed we’re a community and everyone was looking after the vulnerable and the elderly, which was great but we should be doing that anyway. My message? To keep that going and get people to be kinder, that’s all I’m trying to do.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

One-off benefits, including the long spell of good weather, were not likely to be repeated while a potential recession could dampen demand for non-food items sold by Argos.Roberts said: “The situation ahead is very unpredictable. We have made sure the business is ready to handle that.”Analysts have predicted a grocery price war, and Roberts said Sainsbury’s had lowered prices on a further 200 products in recent weeks and extended its “price lock” promise to 1,000 items.He said some of the changes to shopper behaviour seen during the coronavirus lockdown would stick. Shoppers were indicating that they intended to continue to buy more fresh ingredients and cook at home, while half of additional online grocery orders came from new shoppers.Roberts said Sainsbury’s had increased capacity to deal with online orders by setting up collection points outside stores and had taken on 25,000 extra staff to help pick orders in shops.“We are continuing to look at what we can do to satisfy demand,” he said. “We need to prepare for substantially more customers wishing to shop online than at the beginning of this crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/325dad4e06cae9a2530b7cb7f87e51a167319306/0_203_3038_1822/master/3038.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0e59db9f1448c5caee0ac180d6ddfba2","title":"job losses uk house prices covid 19 ssp factories markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsEconomists are welcoming today’s ADP Payroll report, and the news that 2.4 new jobs were created in June:There’s also astonishment that May’s data has been revised so dramatically, from 2.7m jobs lost to 3m created. ADP’s report is based on actual payroll figures, not finger-waving estimates, but clearly the pandemic is making it harder to produce accurate data.Just in: US companies hired nearly 2.4m extra staff in June, as America’s economy emerged from lockdown.Payroll company ADP has reported that the labor market strengthened last month, with private sector employment up by 2.369m. Small business (with less than 50 staff) hired 937,000 more staff, with medium-sized firms taking on 559k and large companies (at least 500 staff) taking on 873k.Service sector firms took on 1.9m new workers, ADP says, including nearly one million in leisure and hospitality, after States eased Covid-19 restrictions. Manufacturers hired 457k more staff. Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said that small business hiring picked up in the month of June, adding:“As the economy slowly continues to recover, we are seeing a significant rebound in industries that once experienced the greatest job losses.In fact, 70 percent of the jobs added this month were in the leisure and hospitality, trade and construction industries.” This will please the White House - although the recent lockdowns re-imposed in states such as California, Texas, Florida and Arizona could lead to fresh job losses.ADP has also pulled a screeching u-turn on May’s numbers.

It now thinks that 3m were created!The job cuts announced today by John Lewis and Harrods show that department store are reeling from the pandemic, writes my colleague Sarah Butler here:Back in the markets, anxiety about the Covid-19 pandemic is pushing shares down.Sir Philip Green is also wielding the jobs axe, according to fashion trade magazine Drapers.It reports that Green’s Arcadia group is cutting 500 head office jobs, or one in five positions. And again, the Covid-19 lockdown is responsible, with Arcadia anticipating weak retail sales for some time.In the email to staff, seen by Drapers, chief executive Ian Grabiner said: “We are continuing to live through an unprecedented global crisis and, as you know, our stores and head office temporarily closed on 20 March. Although our digital platforms provided us with some much-needed sales whilst our stores were closed, it certainly didn’t make up for the loss of sales from our stores and franchise partners.“We and our partners are unlikely to see the same level of footfall on the high street anytime soon. We can’t ignore the impact this will have on our business and we need to adapt. We have already been reducing our store estate over the last few years but we also need to generate further cost savings across our company in order to ensure we have a solid foundation for the future. In order for us to achieve this, we need to restructure our head office to support a more focused and future proofed organisation.”It is understood that staff will receive more information about their inidual situations later today. Drapers understands that the job cuts impact various teams, including those in buying and design across Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins.Ratings agency S\u0026ampP has warned that the UK could be heading into a ‘perfect storm’ of economic misery.In a new report, S\u0026ampP says that Britain is vulnerable to a second-wave of coronavirus infections, followed by an economic jolt if it can’t agree a free trade deal with the EU before 2021.“A second, bigger wave of (coronavirus) infections in autumn, then followed by a switch to WTO trade rules in January would be a perfect storm.”Even Harrods isn’t immune to the economic cost of Covid-19.Business Insider is reporting that the Knightsbridge-based luxury department store is cutting almost 700 jobs, as it tries to cut costs. Although Harrods reopened last month (with social distancing rules), the slump in international travel has badly hurt the store, which is usually very popular with well-heeled tourists.Harrods CEO Michael Ward told employees about the cuts in a memo early on Tuesday, June 30.“The necessary social distancing requirements to protect employees and customers is having a huge impact on our ability to trade, while the devastation in international travel has meant we have lost key customers coming to our store and frontline operations. The Covid-19 pandemic is also forcing job cuts at retail group John Lewis, according to reports this morning.The Evening Standard says Sharon White, its new chair, has warned staff that some stores will close permanently, resulting in job losses. The blow comes as John Lewis also announces another raft of store reopenings.In a bombshell letter to staff, Sharon White this week told 80,000 staff at the mutual, which also includes Waitrose, that its prized bonus will likely be ditched next year as the company wrestles to improve profitability.At the start of the Covid crisis, sources at the group warned it was unlikely all 50 of its department stores would reopen after the lockdown. White confirmed plans to close a several unnamed shops, with staff informed in mid-July. Around 20 stores have reopened since non-essential retailers were given the green light to reopen on June 15 with distancing measures in place. Plans to open a further 10 were announced today, including Oxford Street on July 16.John Lewis is also planning to vacate one of its two large London offices, in response to the jump in home working.

This is compounded by many manufacturers having to manage higher debt levels that they would normally operate with. Understanding and managing the risks of overtrading for businesses of all sizes will be critical.The sector will need to continue to show resilience, agility and careful planning, to battle through such challenges.” The pandemic is forcing Britain’s manufacturers to keep slashing jobs.Data firm IHS Market reports that employment at UK factories fell for the fifth consecutive month in June. Although the rate of decline eased further from April’s record it remained among the steepest registered in the 28-year survey history. There were reports of redundancies, cost control efforts, workforce restructuring and the non-replacement of leavers. Manufacturers also reported that new orders kept falling in June, although output did rise as more factories returned to work.This lifted the UK manufacturing PMI to 50.1, just above stagnation.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit , fears that job losses will accelerate as the UK government winds up its furloughing scheme:“The main focus is now shifting towards the labour market. Concerns are rising about the potential for marked job losses, especially once the phase out of government support schemes begins. The news on that footing is less positive, with June seeing a further reduction in staffing levels and, although easing sharply since April’s record, the rate of job loss remains among the steepest in the 29-year survey history.Economic conditions will need to improve markedly across the UK, or some support retained, if the labour market downturn is to avoid becoming more entrenched through the remainder of the year.” Here’s our news story on the downturn in UK property prices:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b153ba3b7b718490e85c4829317db073089fef71/66_0_4995_3000/master/4995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd762ea09cdc852d9cc6367c145ae45","title":"goldsmiths sack casual staff exams universities covid 19","story":"Universities exploited academics on temp contracts before Covid-19. We refuse to be low-hanging fruit in the funding crisisThis is precisely what is happening at Goldsmiths, University of London, as management plans to effectively lay off nearly 500 precarious academics. But we are fighting back. I am one of about 100 casualised lecturers who are refusing to grade student essays until Goldsmiths meets our three key demands: for contract extensions at least until October, for clarity on our futures and for negotiation over the future of the university. We are aware that by doing this we risk recriminations from senior management, given that our action isn’t sanctioned by a trade union, but we felt we had no other choice: due to the onerous anti-union laws, we would not have been able to call an official strike until after most of our contracts had ended.We acknowledge that there are financial problems at Goldsmiths, as there are at other universities, but our proposal takes account of these: keep us on until the autumn, and then student numbers will show whether or not there are the funds and the student demand to renew our contracts in the longer term. University admissions figures are promising, and suggest students may turn up to university in October after all. The situation at Goldsmiths has been ultimately created by the funding regime introduced by the coalition government’s 2010 reforms to the higher education sector. The crisis is the result of what Amelia Horgan calls “a decade of marketisation”. The reforms of 2010 made universities much more reliant on fees, particularly the higher fees that can be charged to international students. Such a business model cannot absorb the short-term but severe shock of a temporary collapse in international student numbers. At the same time, our marking boycott has shown how universities’ scandalous exploitation of precarious academic labour is equally unsustainable.A spokesperson for Goldsmiths told Times Higher Education that the university was facing “new financial pressures and difficult decisions due to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic”, that the university “has not terminated any associate lecturer contracts early”, and that the “vast majority of associate lecturers would not normally be employed by us over the summer period”.But we’ve decided enough is enough. Despite our precarity, we are now setting the agenda and forcing the university’s senior managers to respond to our demands. We recently organised a virtual picket (Covid-19 meant a physical one was impossible) to amplify our demands. Using #saveourjobs, thousands of supporters bombarded Goldsmiths with tweets questioning how a supposedly “progressive” institution could justify sacking 500 precarious academics. We trended on Twitter in London, and now the combined pressure of the marking boycott and our social media operation has finally brought management to the negotiating table.To move beyond the UK’s exploitative, market-driven system, we have to empower and listen to the growing mass of casualised academics and imagine a more collaborative university sector that values all of its workers equally. Goldsmiths, long thought of as a bastion of radical politics, should take the lead in outlining these visions of a better future. Sadly, senior management has yet to rise to this challenge. By contrast, we precarious Goldsmiths academics are politicising the scandal of casualisation through bold and imaginative collective actions. With support from both casualised and permanent academics at universities across the country, we can and we will save our jobs and end casualisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4a979f2a1e6793f53d3420cf52aa23ddd618566/0_194_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1baaeb799a48fdb28880e119c33d59cd","title":"leicester local lockdown","story":"Our city is closing again before it really opened. All we can do is sit tight in the rooms we have grown tired ofOn a traffic island to the west of Leicester, my adopted city, a small replica of the Statue of Liberty stands and guards our freedoms. A plaque explains that she was not placed there out of pro-American feelings, but as a gesture by the manufacturer of liberty bodices, which once had factories nearby.I walked past the statue this morning after hearing the news that Leicester would return to local lockdown as the rest of the UK opened up from Saturday. When I got home, I saw a post on Facebook suggesting that outbreaks of coronavirus in the city can be traced to the factories that sustain Leicester’s now diminished rag trade. And the Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire, Andrew Bridgen, has said the garment industry was partially to blame for the outbreak. Small, non-unionised, heavily staffed by non-English speakers: these factories make a good scapegoat, but few of us will ever know the truth about why Leicester became a hotspot for Covid-19. Still, with information in short supply, people invent their own.For the past few weeks, I’ve been awaiting news of when I’ll be allowed to visit my partner’s house. We live separately during the lockdown, when we’ve relied on the company of housemates and have been deprived of much contact beyond a Regency-style constitutional walk, we’ve counted the days until home visits are permitted. When the government announced that old freedoms would return from 4 July, we exchanged ecstatic texts.A few mornings later, I woke to a message from my mum informing me that Leicester might be facing a fresh outbreak of coronavirus cases. “I doubt they’ll sort it out in time,” I replied, “it’s not like there’s been great organisation so far.” Still, I started to keep my eye out for reports. My partner, who works in libraries, mentioned she’d heard talk of a local lockdown. No one seemed to know exactly what this entailed. I stopped planning a celebration for 4 July.The was more confusion than clarity in the week before the lockdown was announced. One moment the home secretary, Priti Patel, was suggesting that Leicester was definitely facing lockdown, the next our mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, was saying it was the first he’d heard of it. Soulsby reportedly said he’d received an email in the small hours with information about the lockdown, but said he had been unable to access the data to assess the situation himself. I found myself hoping guiltily for official incompetence to save us from more time indoors. Months of bored isolation had to come to an end. Rumours began to swirl about which parts of the city were infected. The north, the east young people, old. Some places had never closed down – others were about to.When the first wave of lockdown ended, people no longer walked in defensive, hunched-up shuffles. The streets were quieter than before the lockdown, the meadows emptier of people doing their daily exercise, but people ambled along as though they were no longer at risk. Cyclists started using the roads again. Today on my morning stroll, it felt as though paranoia had set in. Leicester was closing again before it had really opened. I spoke to one shop assistant who said he was waiting to hear from his manager about whether to come to work next week. He had been told nothing about any plans for a local furlough scheme (it has now been confirmed that there will be one). My partner was at work preparing for libraries to be re-opened. They were still waiting for official confirmation this wouldn’t be needed. No one seems to be in charge.Leicester is poor, in some parts shockingly so. It has a multiethnic population with large groups of people who are at heightened risk from the virus. It has factories that have stayed open and workers who travel to them by bus. We have an inconvenient habit of voting Labour. If anywhere was going to suffer, it would be Leicester. For now, we sit tight in rooms we’ve grown tired of, missing our loved ones and jumping at any news. It can only be a matter of weeks, we tell ourselves. Leicester has always felt left behind. It took coronavirus to make that a matter of fact.• Rob Palk is the author of Animal Lovers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac96d8471195bf44ce18d8ef955d21072685d210/0_89_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=058f345a3f144d5e57d2f0ac68393f6c","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e83125c2bd6d6627d36720e360fc14bdfb7d09/0_130_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e9575049fb446d7859ca0009ad80083","title":"welsh schoolchildren to learn about arandora star sinking via radio","story":"Theatre company has chosen coronavirus-friendly medium instead of stage productionThe story of how 53 Welsh Italians lost their lives when the ship Arandora Star sank 80 years ago as it transported them to second world war internment camps is to be told via a back-to-basics, coronavirus-friendly medium.Entitled simply Arandora Star, the play will be streamed – in Welsh and English – into classrooms in the autumn. The move has been praised by arts industry leaders as an example of innovation in challenging times.The theatre company’s artistic director and co-writer of the play, Geinor Styles, said: “We are hugely disappointed that for the first time in three decades we will not be able to provide our usual production, but the safety of the children, our actors and creative teams is paramount.“We believe that producing a radio version of the play is a great solution in these uncertain times. It will ensure that the arts and theatre continue to thrive and the children of Wales are not losing out on the creative industries playing an important role in their schooling.”The company’s productions are seen every year by about 5,000 children between the ages of eight and 11. “I’m very happy that the tradition will continue and they will not lose out because of Covid-19,” said Styles.The Arandora Star, a converted cruise ship, was sunk en route to Canada in the Atlantic by a German torpedo on 2 July 1940, with the loss of more than 800 lives. Among those on board were Welsh Italians, many from the valleys of south Wales who had been declared “enemy aliens” by the British government.The play tells the story of a fictional character called Lina as she struggles to cope with the loss of her father, Guido, on the vessel and how she and her mother, Carmela, survive in a time of war and prejudice.“It’s a relevant story for now about how we deal with immigration,” said Styles. She also said teachers were pleased that as well as reminding the UK of a tragic, sometimes forgotten episode, the style of the piece may help bring back listening skills.The director, Dan Lloyd, said telling stories about episodes like the internment of Welsh Italians was vital. He said: “Although Arandora Star is a story set eight decades ago, there is much to be learned from history. Telling such stories ignites empathy, which is the key to helping things improve.”It is appropriate that one of the most famous examples of the radio play is a Welsh one – Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood, which was revived during lockdown by a cast of household names and key workers.Fiona Allan, president of UK Theatre, praised the move by Theatr na nÓg. She said: “I’m encouraged to see companies finding innovative ways of getting culture into the classroom whilst theatres around the nation remain closed. It’s vitally important that our young future audience experience theatre and the arts at a young age.“We’re all acutely aware of the risk Covid-19 poses to our industry, with theatres and arts companies throughout the UK at risk of collapse, and desperately in need of more than the government’s roadmap. We need dates to work towards in order to plan properly towards reopening the sector.“In the meantime, Theatr na nÓg are demonstrating great resilience and forward thinking in bring this production to schools throughout Wales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621830b87003585e894d48efdb78fdc0fe4c7d3/0_0_5129_3078/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ab929304f49e4999be05007f7cd2ed","title":"are private schools serious about tackling racism i give them a d ","story":"These institutions are reacting to questions about their makeup with committees, discussions and action plans. Must try harderCan private schools solve racism?Charlie, by emailThis is my first day back at the  after I took two weeks off, although – hoo boy! – it feels more like a decade. Since I last wrote here, there have been global protests about the racist murder of George Floyd. JK Rowling sparked widespread fury when people realised they couldn’t cast a silencio spell over her and stop her committing that terrible crime of talking about how female biology has affected her life. And – oh yeah! – we are still living through a global plague.So a lot has been going on. This may be a radical admission from a journalist, but I pretty much stopped stopped following the news while I was off, for my own sanity. But just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in again. While I was blissfully trying to ignore everything and stop having more sodding opinions, I received an email from my old private school in New York, which reassured the alumnae that, in the wake of the epidemic of killings of black people in the US, there would be “discussions” between the teachers and pupils about “violence against people of colour”. Also, the school library is curating an “anti-racism reading list”. Alas, the discussions and reading list were not enough and some former students told the New York Times that they had suffered from racial abuse while at the school. Cue further panicky-slash-handwringing emails from the school, culminating in a “plan of action”. This included more “ersity training”, an “inclusive curriculum” and, last of all, a promise to “review student composition”.British private schools have sent out similar letters and made comparable statements. They are, as the currently popular phrase has it, “doing the work”. But are they? Westminster School has said, in response to recent complaints from former students, that it is establishing a “challenging racism committee”, and that it will work to “ensure a erse school community that is truly reflective of the multicultural city in which we live”.I called Westminster, curious as to how it would achieve this erse and reflective community, given that its fees are in excess of £41k a year for boarders, and more than £28k for day students. It could not share that information, but it reminded me it had formed the challenging racism committee “which will look at the ersity of both the staff and pupils”. When I asked whether this would just be about racial ersity or also other forms too, I was told to ask again later in the year.Gender and ethnicity are important, but social class remains the biggest factor in determining the quality and length of a person’s life in this country, so it should play a bigger part than it does in the vogue for identity politics, not least because race and class intersect so much. If private schools were really serious about ersity, they would expand scholarships for working-class kids of all backgrounds. At the very least, they would let state schools use their facilities I once visited a state school in the morning that didn’t even have a library, and then a private one in the afternoon that had a screening room. Instead, they issue press releases about “discussions” and reading lists. It boggles the brain that these schools have charitable status in the UK.I get a lot of guff in my inbox, from fashion brands avowing how anti-racist they are despite never featuring black models in the shows, to Instagram influencers fighting oppression one sexy selfie at a time. But the schools issue is more important, given what an enormously unfair advantage private schools give to a child’s long-term prospects and it is gross – if entirely predictable – how little the schools are willing to try to change to stop entrenching inequality. As efforts go, I give this a D-.

The former 007 discusses fatherhood, family and the lonely childhood that shaped himI am 10 minutes into my Zoom interview with Pierce Brosnan when his son Dylan arrives off-screen with his father’s coffee. “Did you put sugar in this?” he says to the 23-year-old. “Some more milk, please, I don’t take mine black.” Dylan is sent back to correct it.Naturally, the pandemic has disrupted Brosnan’s schedule, too he was shooting Cinderella in London until Covid-19 halted production. He returned to the northern shore of Hawaii, where he has remained since with his wife, the journalist and author Keely Shaye Smith, and their two sons, Dylan and Paris, 19. (Brosnan also has three children from his first marriage.)“We are a close family and this time of covid has nourished and nurtured a bond between us all that probably would not have existed without the lockdown,” he says.Brosnan is sitting at his kitchen table, in front of a bright Indigenous Australian painting, which he bought in Sydney during a “tour of duty” as James Bond. He is here to talk about his supporting role in the Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. The film, which was originally scheduled to coincide with this year’s contest, follows two would-be pop stars (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) in their quest to represent Iceland in a fictionalised version of the competition.There was hopeful expectation in some quarters that Brosnan might lend his singing voice, given his infamous performances in the Mamma Mia! films (his singing in the first film was so comical that it landed him the Razzie for worst supporting actor at the 2009 awards). Was he shocked not to be given the chance to sing on screen again? “I was surprised, I was disappointed, I was crestfallen,” he responds, good-naturedly.Brosnan plays Ferrell’s disparaging father (“Which I thought was a bit of a long shot”), who resents his son’s wild ambitions and wants him to aspire to a more conventional future. It is not a parenting style familiar to Brosnan. “My boys are academic and have a creative instinct and intuition towards the arts. So I don’t try to direct them.”His younger sons’ careers in film-making, acting (Dylan) and modelling (Paris) have seen them amass their own fame they have social media followings in the tens of thousands. They stole the show at this year’s Golden Globes in their roles as ambassadors, shepherding celebrities on and off stage in black tie. Does their social media fame worry him?“Yes, it does concern my wife, Keely, and I,” he says. “The footprint that they’re leaving will stay with them for many years to come. It’s treacherous waters. I went on Instagram to follow Paris, to make sure that he was acquitting himself well and not entering into any kind of liaisons with folk of ill repute. It’s a strange animal and you have to be careful with it. It can be narcissistic and you have to balance it out with human lightness.”Born in 1953, Brosnan was raised in Navan, 30 miles north-west of Dublin. An only child, he has described his childhood as a solitary, Roman Catholic upbringing. “My father took off for the hills and, for my mother, it was a very difficult time in the 50s to be a single parent. So, in many respects, I created my own self,” he says.After his father left, his mother moved to London when Brosnan was four. She wanted a better life for them. He waited for her in Ireland and lived in a succession of houses – with his maternal grandparents’, with his aunt and uncle, at a boarding house.“I’m very grateful that I didn’t have the shackles of parenting, so to speak, and really cleaved my own path in life. When, as a young teenager, I told my mother that I wanted to be an actor, she was extremely supportive of that. She wholeheartedly said: ‘Follow your dreams.’”Brosnan moved to Putney in west London when he was 12. At school, he was nicknamed Irish. “Being an Irish immigrant in London in ’64, they don’t let you forget that.” He later worked briefly as a commercial artist, but, having been raised on “cowboys and Indians, Old Mother Riley, Norman Wisdom”, he still dreamed of acting.Brosnan stumbled upon the Ovalhouse theatre in south London and found himself “in the company of poets and musicians and outcasts and mangled souls”. His breakthrough came when he landed a small part in a Tennessee Williams play, The Red Devil Battery Sign, as the understudy.“It didn’t work out for this other fellow,” says Brosnan. “I got the call: ‘Tennessee wants to see you now.’ I tore out of the flat and hopped on a bus. The bus was going too slow, so I got off and ran. My heart was pounding – Tennessee Williams wants to see me. I got to Tennessee’s apartment, and we read through two very emotional scenes and just let it fly. And I got the job.”They opened at the Roundhouse theatre in north London in 1977, with Brosnan’s performance receiving critical acclaim. Williams sent him a telegram stating only: “Thank God for you, my dear boy.”“It was an affirmation that I was on the right path, that I had the talent – a tiny bit of gold in my back pocket,” says Brosnan. “That made me hungry to be an actor. Once I found the world of acting, I clung to it with all my heart. It was liberating.”It was a hugely successful start to a stage career, but Brosnan’s ambitions lay elsewhere. “I always dreamed of the movies,” he says. “The stage, as exhilarating as it was, always terrified me. I wanted to be up on the silver screen.”In 1982, he landed the role of the charming TV detective Remington Steele. He moved to California with his first wife, the Australian actor Cassandra Harris, and their son, Sean, and her two children, Charlotte and Christopher, whom Brosnan later adopted. In 1987, Harris fell ill while filming in India and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died four years later. Charlotte would die of the same disease in 2013.Brosnan turned to the therapeutic qualities of painting while Harris was ill and he has continued ever since. “I started painting in 1987 when my late wife had cancer. I had been painting out of pain, and now the pain sometimes comes through in colour,” he said at the charity auction of his painting of Bob Dylan in 2018. It sold for €1.2m (£1.1m).He found the fortitude to keep acting, too. In 1993, he made it on to the silver screen in Mrs Doubtfire. “At day’s end, you want to look around and hopefully you have a handful of films that you can be proud of participating in. That is definitely one of those movies for me.”He speaks just as fondly of the film’s late star, Robin Williams. “I went into the makeup trailer and there was Robin, sitting in the makeup chair. He had a Hawaiian shirt on and cargo pants, and his hairy arms and hairy legs hanging out. He had the head of Mrs Doubtfire and greeted me: ‘Oh, Pierce! Oh, you look so handsome, oh, give us a kiss.’” (Brosnan’s Mrs Doubtfire impression is impeccable.)At this point, Brosnan had already been offered the role of Bond, but had been obliged to refuse it due to his Remington Steele contract. When he made his Bond debut, in 1995’s Goldeneye, he made it count.His iteration of Bond – sensitive, suave, serious – proved to be a huge success, critically and commercially. Hindsight has bolstered Daniel Craig’s gritty, brutish incarnation of 007 as the best since Connery’s, but Brosnan played the role with a twinkle in the eye and the humour that such a cartoonish character deserves.After his final outing as Bond, Die Another Day in 2002, the producers felt the franchise needed a reboot to stay relevant in a post-911, post-Bourne world. Although Brosnan was keen to do a fifth film, the producers had settled on recasting the role and told him so over the phone in 2004 he would later say he felt he had been “kicked to the kerb”. “There’s no regret,” he says now. “I do not let regret come into my world … It just leads to more misery and more regrets.”“Bond is the gift that keeps giving and has allowed me to have a wonderful career. Once you’re branded as a Bond, it’s with you for ever, so you better make peace with it and you’d better understand that when you walk through those doors and pick up the mantle of playing James Bond.”Since relinquishing the role, Brosnan has generally been reticent about later instalments (“Not my monkey, not my circus,” he said in an interview with Esquire last year). He has, however, said enthusiastically that it is time for a woman to take over the role (“Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there!”). Why does he think there is so much resistance to recasting the role of Bond (and other iconic British figures, such as the Doctor in Doctor Who) as a woman or a person of colour?He pauses and slowly taps his kitchen table. “I’m gonna leave that right there,” he says, with a knowing smile and a single, slow shake of the head.Brosnan has had a successful career since leaving the franchise – his performances in The Matador, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and Mamma Mia! stand out – and he was not hampered by the weight of the role he left behind.In 2010, Brosnan starred as a fictional British former prime minister accused of war crimes (yes, he based his performance on Tony Blair, he says) in Roman Polanski’s thriller The Ghost Writer. What does he make of the criticism of those who work with Polanski, given his rape conviction?Brosnan is silent for a full 10 seconds. “Well,” he says, steadily, “I took to the role and to the part in The Ghost Writer because of the work that Roman has done as an artist, as a director. I didn’t let the rest of his life influence my choice. I had to be honest with myself and know that justice had been done, half undone, and went forth as an actor.”Would he make the same decision again today?“I don’t know if, in this climate, I would have made the same decision, the same choice. These are dangerous times and it’s a very toxic world. I don’t know.”When he talks of the “climate”, it is clear he is referring to the world after #MeToo. “It was shocking,” he says of the scale of abuse powerful figures such as Harvey Weinstein got away with for so long. He punctuates every few words with a short pause. “It was absolutely appalling and really has changed the landscape and the workplace for women in Hollywood. It was a mighty fall from grace and one that was really ugly and sad for all parties concerned … that this man should have acquitted himself in such a fashion in the company of young women who were trying to make a career for themselves – it was upsetting to see that behaviour unfold on a daily, weekly basis.”Brosnan has been prolific in recent years. He has four films in production and a fifth awaiting release.“I have no desire to retire,” he says. “I am a man of 67 years now and the parts that will come to me will be the parts of the elder, the parts of the comedic turn. At this point in life, I don’t know what else to do but act and paint.”In the immediate future, there is a pandemic to navigate and a US presidential election on the horizon (Brosnan is a dual citizen of Ireland and the US). More than once in our conversation, Brosnan laments “the disease of racism” and urges people to vote. “I would like to think that the vaccine will come soon for the disease of corona. And I would like to think, also, a vaccine will come for the disease of racism and that we can really come together as communities to respect each other’s religions and beliefs and not to be so judgmental.”He continues: “With change comes struggle. But I have hope in our young people, I have hope in my sons’ generation that they will see the awful, shameful neglect that we’ve paid to each other’s religions, race, the nature of our lives, the environment that we live in. I have the strongest belief that the youth of today will make a big change, will have the courage to get out and vote for the rights of people – not racism and not ignorance and malignant narcissism.”If this sounds like wishful thinking, it is in keeping with Brosnan’s nature. “My eldest son said: ‘Dad is just a dreamer.’ But my dreaming has gotten me this far in life. So I shall continue dreaming and continue being the man I am and doing the best I can, with the tiny bit of gold talent that I’ve got.”Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is out now on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8254cc51be58bc0749aba8741dc4e63e40ec09/752_1513_6136_3680/master/6136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4be97cecaf4a169679865e5347e4798","title":"how to cook crab linguine recipe felicity cloake","story":"Revive memories of Italian seaside cafes with this step-by-step guide to making classic crab linguineFew things scream summer holiday to me more than a big bowl of briny, seafood-studded pasta, even if it’s going to be eaten in front of the TV rather than some pretty Italian harbour. Happily, seafood is one of the things we do rather well in this country, and this dish is the perfect end for a fat, brown, British crab. Sunshine optional.\u0026nbsp2 brown crabs, or 200g brown crabmeat and 200g white crabmeat 400g linguine2 garlic cloves1 red chilli1 tbsp olive oil1 tsp fennel seeds, crushed1 lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly choppedExtra-virgin olive oil, to finishStart with the crab. You may have bought it ready picked, but if not, you’ll need to get at the meat first. There are many online videos and tutorials showing this process in detail, but start by snapping off the claws close to the body, then remove the bottom of the shell by inserting the tip of a knife into the mouth (just below the eyes) and twisting gently.Prise off the back of the shell and locate and remove the hard spiny bits around the eyes and mouth, and the yellowish stomach sac attached to them, plus any bits of papery membrane and the dead man’s fingers, the greyish fronds around the edge of the shell. (Despite the name, they’re not poisonous, but they’re not very tasty, either.)Scoop the brown meat into one bowl and the white into another – a\u0026nbspsharp tap with a hammer, rolling pin or even a wooden spoon will help you to get into the stuff in the claws. Don’t miss the white meat in the leg sockets, either the handle of a teaspoon is a useful tool here. Keep any large pieces of claw meat separate.\u0026nbspBring a large pan of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta to your taste – this should take around eight to 10 minutes, unless you like it very al dente or very soft. Linguine is my preference here, but spaghetti, or any other long pasta, would also be fine (in fact, let’s be honest, almost any shape would be delicious).\u0026nbspWhile the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, and deseed and finely chop the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds for a couple of minutes until soft, but not coloured remember that garlic, in particular, burns easily.Take the frying pan off the heat, grate in the zest of half the lemon, then squeeze in the juice of the whole thing (do this through your other hand, to catch any errant pips alternatively, squeeze it into a cup and pour it into the pan through a sieve). Now stir in all the brown crab meat until well combined.\u0026nbspScoop a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water out of the pan and set aside, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan, season and toss it around to coat the strands with the sauce add a little of the reserved cooking water, if you think it needs loosening.\u0026nbspRoughly chop the parsley, set a little aside to garnish and add the rest to the pan along with the 200g white crab meat (if you don’t have any large claw pieces, keep a little bit back, to finish). Toss again, ide between bowls and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with the remaining parsley and the claw (or reserved white) meat, and serve at once.If you’d like to add vegetables, the River Cafe puts shaved fresh fennel into its crab pasta, while River Cottage goes for fresh tomatoes (I reckon a handful of the cherry variety, added to the pan with the garlic and chilli, so they just burst in the heat, would be best). Tinned crab doesn’t seem to work well here, sadly – or at least not the brands I’ve tried.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

However less than a month later and a week since Au Yeung was announced as the majority owner, the club has appointed the administrators Gerald Krasner and Paul Stanley, of insolvency practitioners Begbies Traynor.In a statement, Krasner said: “Our immediate objectives are to ensure the club completes all its fixtures this season and to urgently find interested parties to save Wigan Athletic FC and the jobs of the people who work for the club.“Obviously the suspension of the Championship season due to Covid-19 has had a significant impact on the recent fortunes of the club. Wigan Athletic has been a focal point and source of pride for the town since 1932 and anyone who is interested in buying this historic sporting institution should contact the joint administrators.”Krasner told the  he was still gathering full information about the club’s financial position and the cause of its collapse into administration, having only been approached about the appointment last week.IEC bought Wigan from the sports and retail magnate Dave Whelan for £15.9m, but despite winning promotion from League One last season, the company said it was dissatisfied with the loss-making finances of the Championship and the UK’s uncertain economic prospects after Brexit. IEC sold to Au Yeung’s consortium for £17.5m, plus repayment of £24.36m the company had invested in the club.Since buying the club the company said it sustained increases in players wages to £17.5m, from £10m in 2017-18, and sustained a £9m loss for the 13 months to 30 June last year. Whelan, the former Blackburn Rovers player who made his corporate fortune with his retail empire JJB Sports, bought Wigan, his local club, in 1995, building a new stadium and funding a rise from League Two to eight years in the Premier League, before relegation in 2013 and the decision to sell five years later. The chairman in 2018, his grandson David Sharpe, said at the time of selling to IEC that they were “a suitable owner with the funds and ambition to carry on the family legacy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf05138502145a9b99134cf3620081708b854de/0_209_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3501c0d2241fc68db112fdd73dc0ffdd","title":"decolonise and rename streets of uganda and sudan activists urge","story":"Campaigners target statues of slave owners and roads named after imperial armies as protests spread to AfricaCampaigners have asked Uganda’s parliament to order the removal of monuments to British colonialists and to rename streets commemorating imperial military forces.Uganda gained independence in 1962 after almost 70 years as a British protectorate, and more than 5,000 people have signed a petition to “decolonise and rename” the dozens of statues and street names which remain.Among the disputed statues is one of Lord Fredrick Lugard, a prominent military colonial official in east Africa with a reputation for cruelty. Campaigners want to change the name of King’s African Rifles Drive in Kampala, named after the British unit deployed in the brutal campaign against the Mau Mau uprising in neighbouring Kenya.Statues in the US, UK and across Europe have been defaced and pulled down in recent weeks. Across Africa, many monuments were replaced when successive states gained independence. In South Africa, where students took down the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 2015, a statue of Paul Kruger, 19th-century Boer leader, was recently vandalised.In Sudan, activists are demanding that a Khartoum street where the British embassy is situated, named after slave trader Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur be renamed. The road leads to the military headquarters where last year’s peaceful protest against then-president Omar al-Bashir was dispersed violently and more than 120 people were killed.Hafiz Ibrahim, of Justice Africa , said: “We demand the change of the street name and an apology from the grandchildren of those who opposed the abolition of slavery in Sudan.”The Ugandan campaigner Apollo Makubuya said the aim was to name streets “in a manner that addresses the legacy of colonialism and oppression, promotes national heroes and heroines as well as contributes to national harmony, respect for and protection of human rights and dignity”.Erias Lukwago, the lord mayor of Kampala, said the cause was justified. “There are names which can be left … reflecting our history because colonialism is part of our heritage anyway.

But very little of this oil is refined in the country because its four state-owned refineries are dysfunctional or have closed. Instead, international dealers export to Nigeria around 900,000 tonnes a year of low-grade, “dirty” fuel, made in Dutch, Belgian and other European refineries, and hundreds of small-scale artisanal refineries produce large quantities of illegal fuel from oil stolen from the network of oil pipelines that criss-cross the Niger delta.The net result, says international resource watchdog group Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) in a new report, is that Nigeria has some of the worst air pollution in the world, with dense clouds of choking soot hanging over gridlocked cities leading to a rise in serious health conditions as well as damaged vehicles.The extreme toxicity of the “official” fuel exported from Europe surprised researchers who took samples of diesel sold in government-licensed filling stations in Port Harcourt and Lagos. They found that on average the fuel exceeded EU pollution limits by as much as 204 times, and by 43 times the level for gasoline.Laboratory analysis also showed that the black market fuel was highly polluting but of a higher quality than the imported diesel and gasoline. The average “unofficial” diesel tested exceeded the level of EU sulphur standards 152 times, and 40 times the level for gasoline.“Our research suggests that Nigeria is having dirty fuel dumped on it that cannot be sold to other countries with higher and better implemented standards. The situation is so bad that the average diesels sampled are of an even lower quality that that produced by artisanal refining camps in the creeks of the Niger delta,” said Florence Kayemba, SDN programme manager.With more than 11m, mostly old, cars imported from Europe and Japan on the roads, and hundreds of thousands of inefficient generators used by households and businesses for electricity, Nigeria ranks fourth in the world for deaths caused by air pollution. It has been estimated that 114,000 people die prematurely from air pollution each year. The air quality in cities like Port Harcourt, Aba, Onitsha and Kaduna has reached crisis levels of pollution in recent years, and there is mounting evidence of rising asthma, lung, heart and respiratory diseases.More than half of developing countries, mainly in Africa and Latin America, still use high-sulphur fuels which have long been illegal to burn in western countries. In Nigeria the practice is encouraged by an opaque fuel subsidy system that keeps prices relatively low at the pumps, but is widely thought to fuel corruption. Refineries in Europe are allowed to make the fuel if countries agree to accept it.The SDN report, part-funded by the UK Foreign Office’s anti-corruption conflict, stability and security fund, calculates that around half the air pollution in Port Harcourt, a city of more than 3 million people, comes from the burning of official and unofficial fuel. The rest comes from nearby gas flaring, other industries, and the burning of rubbish.“The Niger delta already suffers environmental, health and livelihood impacts from decades of oil spill pollution, gas flaring and artisanal refining. This research indicates that it not only experiences the repercussions of producing crude oil, but also in the consumption of dirty official and unofficial fuels,” said the report.“This is even more concerning at a time when Nigeria is facing an outbreak of coronavirus. High levels of pollution and pre-existing respiratory and other health conditions may increase the risk that Covid-19 poses to the health of the population,” said Matthew Halstead of Noctis, which conducted the laboratory research.The SDN report substantiates allegations made in a 2016 Public Eye investigation and a Dutch government report in 2018, that European refineries and commodity brokers were blending crude oil with benzene and other carcinogenic chemicals to create fuels hundreds of times over European pollution limits for the weakly-regulated African market. This was said to be causing significant particulate pollution, damage to vehicles, and adverse health impacts for local populations. Nigeria, along with Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Benin promised in 2017 to stop the imports of “Africa quality” oil products as part of a UN environment programme initiative. But while Ghana has acted, reducing sulphur from 3,000 to 50 parts per million, Nigeria has argued that it needs more time to adapt.However, the recent collapse in oil prices because of Covid-19 means that imported fuel no longer needs to be subsidised and should no longer be a barrier to Nigeria adopting higher standards.The bush refineries are highly dangerous and frequently explode, adding to air, water and soil pollution in the mangrove swamps. But they are an important source of income for communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9c44de1e637c82db9a950f0a0ae57ac9939e6f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=413057466c4c410ac6e6cbfece64791b","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fef5aefb855023b3ee6063f8c702750559f082e/752_723_4843_2905/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a3ff6f19dda0e5bbace0b6e20e03b9","title":"know the score beethoven where to start with his music 250th anniversary","story":"We begin our new series with Beethoven, the gruff uncompromising genius who changed music foreverIt’s not only because this year is the 250th anniversary of his birth that Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) is the obvious composer with whom to begin a series like this, just as it’s no accident of history that almost two centuries after his death, Beethoven is still seen as the archetype of the great composer – the gruff, uncompromising genius increasingly cut off from the world by deafness, who forged his own artistic path, increasingly regardless of what others thought of him and his work.The music by which he’s known to the wider world – whether it’s his\u0026nbspFifth Symphony, with its V for Victory motto that became such a symbol of hope for the allies during the second world war,\u0026nbspthe setting of Schiller’s Ode to Joy that ends his Ninth, or piano works such as the\u0026nbspMoonlight Sonata and the bagatelle\u0026nbspFür Elise, known to generations of aspiring pianists – tells only a small part of the Beethoven story. Such familiar works hardly hint at his significance or the magnitude and breadth of his achievement, let alone explain why he is such a pivotal figure in the history of what we generally regard as “classical” music, and how it developed from the baroque of the 17th century to the modernism of the 20th.Before Beethoven, composers mostly wrote music to order, whether for the church or rich patrons (as JS Bach did) or as employees of European noble courts (as Haydn and Mozart were for much of their creative lives). If the great composers of those eras were often able to transcend such constraints to create music that was elegant and profoundly personal, Beethoven was determined to take that idea of creative independence much farther.He was born in Bonn, where his father (a tenor in service of the archbishop-elector of Cologne) gave Ludwig his earliest music lessons. He started formal composition and piano lessons at 10, and even published some pieces in his early teens, but little of what he wrote between 1785 and his move to Vienna in 1792 was heard in his lifetime. And, as his father’s alcoholism got steadily worse, young Ludwig increasingly took on the responsibility of supporting his family through teaching and playing the viola (getting to know the opera repertory in the process). In Vienna, he studied briefly with Haydn, but really began to establish himself as a pianist rather than a composer, although he was already attracting a number of wealthy sponsors, as he was able to do for much of his life. When he made his public debut as a pianist, in 1795, it was playing what is now known as his\u0026nbspSecond Piano Concerto (actually written before the first).It was a time of turmoil around the world – the US was only a little more than a decade old, while the reverberations of the 1789 French Revolution, and Napoleon’s rise to power in its wake, were being felt across Europe, and the beginnings of the industrial revolution were creating massive social changes of their own. There was revolution in the arts, too, with Romanticism already well established in literature, led in Germany by Goethe (whom Beethoven hugely admired but did not meet until 1812) and in Britain by Wordsworth and the Lakeland poets. It’s dangerous to look for parallels between great artists in different art forms, but if there is a contemporary equivalent to Beethoven in another medium then it would be Goya, an artist who straddled two stylistic eras, whose own journey from court painter to iconoclasm, and his social isolation through his increasing deafness, mirrors that of the composer.Beethoven’s musical journey is traditionally ided into three periods – early, middle and late – but from the early 1800s on the music he composed was constantly evolving, always following its own groundbreaking creative path.The music he wrote in his 20s at the end of the 18th century, such as his first two piano concertos and the first set of string quartets (the\u0026nbspsix Op 18 works), might seem to belong to the same musical world as Haydn and Mozart, but it contained signs that Beethoven was already worrying away at the boundaries of the classical style he’d inherited. Even his earliest piano sonatas are conceived on a far grander scale than anything his predecessors had written, and the energy that drives them often seems to signal his impatience with the constraints of classical sonata form. For just as his life straddled the closing decades of one century and the opening ones of the next, so his music marked the ision between two great eras, the classical and the Romantic – and accelerated the transition from one to the other.Almost every musical genre Beethoven explored was never quite the same again after he’d reinvented it. His first two symphonies do more or less toe the classical line, but the Third, the Eroica, first performed in 1805, was on a different scale altogether. An unambiguous statement of intent – harmonically, formally and expressively – Beethoven was determined to take the symphony into realms never imagined by his predecessors. As if to underline its revolutionary ambitions, he dedicated the score to Napoleon, whom he saw as embodying the democratic, republican ideals of the French revolution. But when, in 1804, the Frenchman declared himself emperor, the composer angrily scratched his name from the title page.By then, the first signs of Beethoven’s deafness were apparent. In an extraordinary letter, the so-called Heiligenstadt Testament, which he wrote but did not send to his two brothers in 1802, he had already made clear his determination to “seize Fate by the throat” and follow his own artistic path, come what may.He did what he promised. Each of the symphonies after the Eroica broke new ground, too. The stark, compelling drama of the\u0026nbspFifth\u0026nbspwas followed by the descriptive music of the Sixth, the Pastoral, which, in its quieter way, was just as revolutionary – no one before had conceived a large-scale instrumental work that so explicitly evoked pictorial scenes (spawning the idea of\u0026nbspprogramme music, taken up so keenly later in the 19th century). The irrepressible energy of the\u0026nbspSeventh, which Richard Wagner described as “the apotheosis of the dance”, was unprecedented, too, while\u0026nbspthe monumentality of the Ninth, with its final celebration of universal brotherhood, took the form even farther into new territory. After Beethoven, no composer could contemplate conceiving a symphony as other than a profoundly personal musical statement.His take on concertos, sonatas, piano trios and string quartets was equally revolutionary: in all those forms, his music went where none had gone before. Before Beethoven, no piano concerto had begun with the unaccompanied solo piano as his\u0026nbspFourth Concerto does, just as none had matched the rampaging scale and grandeur of the Fifth, the so-called Emperor Concerto.\u0026nbspHis\u0026nbsponly violin concerto\u0026nbsppositively luxuriates in its own expansiveness, while the scale and rhetorical power of piano sonatas such as\u0026nbspthe Waldstein, Op 53 and the torrential Appassionata, Op 57, were unmistakably public statements in a musical form the previous century had considered more suited to the salon.All these works, as well as the violin sonata known as the\u0026nbspKreutzer Op 47, the song cycle\u0026nbspAn die Ferne Geliebte\u0026nbsp(the first example of the song cycle form) and\u0026nbspthe three “Rasumovsky” string quartets Op 59 (named after the Russian ambassador in Vienna who commissioned them), are some of the greatest products of what’s regarded as Beethoven’s middle period. His only opera, Fidelio, also dates to those years. Conceived as a\u0026nbspSingspiel, in which spoken dialogue alternates with musical numbers, Fidelio took eight years to reach the form in which it’s usually heard today. Opera is perhaps the only major musical genre whose development was hardly affected by Beethoven’s genius, even if Fidelio’s subject matter, especially the paean to liberty with which it closes, embraced themes that were always close to his heart.Throughout this period, his deafness was steadily getting worse. He made his last public appearance as a pianist in 1814 and through the last decade of his life he was forced to use notebooks to converse with friends. Though he was hailed as the leading composer of his time, he became more and more isolated and irascible, and wrote relatively little during these years, during which he was embroiled in a prolonged dispute over the legal ship of his nephew.The music he did compose increasingly showed little concern as to whether or not it would be understood by his audiences or his peers. If the two great choral works, the\u0026nbspMissa Solemnis\u0026nbspand the Ninth Symphony, both first performed in 1824, were his last great public statements, then\u0026nbspthe final piano sonatas\u0026nbsp– the Hammerklavier, Op 106, and the final trilogy of Op 109-111, and\u0026nbspthe last five string quartets, written in the two years before his death, took his music into a wholly different and rarefied sphere of harmony and thematic and formal intricacy that often baffled even his closest friends and admirers.So, if in his middle-period works Beethoven had ushered in the Romanticism of the 19th century, then in those very final works, especially the late string quartets, he peered even farther into the future. Even to modern ears the ferociously uncompromising Grosse Fuge, intended as a monumental finale to the B flat Quartet, Op 130, remains a tough, almost gruelling experience. It was described by Igor Stravinsky as “an absolutely contemporary piece of music that will be contemporary for ever”, which says everything about Beethoven’s uniqueness, astonishingly forward-looking achievement and continued relevance.Almost all of Beethoven’s substantial output has been thoroughly explored through the recordings, and there are now multiple versions of his greatest works ning almost a century, all easily available and often in sharply contrasting performance styles. Among the finest recent accounts of the nine symphonies performed on modern instruments are those conducted by Claudio Abbado (Deutsche Grammophon) and Riccardo Chailly (Decca), while among the historically informed cycles, using performing techniques on instruments as near as possible to those of Beethoven’s time, are those by John Eliot Gardiner (Archiv) and Frans Brüggen (Glossa).For the piano concertos, there is Maurizio Pollini’s cycle with Abbado conducting the Berlin Philharmonic (Deutsche Grammophon), and Stephen Kovacevich’s with Colin Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra (Philips). Among modern versions of the string quartets, the Takács Quartet remain in a class of their own, while the complete piano sonatas offers a multitude of options – Claudio Arrau (Philips) and Daniel Barenboim (Warner Classics), both from the 1960s, and Annie Fischer (Hungaroton) from the 1970s are still hard to beat.• Our composer guides are running weekly throughout the summer.

But now the Londoner is making grime’s most honest, soul-searching tracksManga Saint Hilare should be out touring his new album Make It Out Alive but, like the rest of us, he’s at home using his time to learn new things. “I’ve been learning how to make beats, improving my Photoshop skills and designing Instagram filters for promotion,” he says. “Things that can help my ting, really.”He even jokes about jumping on TikTok and starting a career there – funny because at 34, the London rapper is now a lot older than the platform’s fresh-faced dancers and meme-slingers. While drill and Afro-swing are the current dominant sounds of UK rap, Manga belongs to a previous generation: the grime MCs who built their credibility earning reloads in raves, the likes of Dizzee Rascal and Kano who paved the way for Stormzy.He joined Roll Deep in 2004, the grime crew who crossed into pop for two UK No 1 singles in 2010, but he always considered himself an outsider and kept a low profile compared with other members such as Wiley. “One time I released a solo single and made £3.58 on iTunes, and this was proper digital downloads,” he says, self-deprecatingly. But being outside of the spotlight can pay more than financial idends. Despite – indeed, perhaps because of – grime not being in fashion as it once was, Manga has made Make It Out Alive one of the most brilliant UK rap releases this year. He sketches out a hopeful future, but references the doubts and difficulties he’s had along the way – this graceful and contemplative outlook is the album’s highlight.He says his 2019 album with rapper Murkage Dave, We Need to Look After Us, was about slowing down and looking inward, and Make It Out Alive continues this self examination – themes of wellbeing and self-care thread them together. “It’s about remaining grounded in everything you do and not allowing this world to kill you. Everyone’s issues vary depending on circumstances, but it’s about always keeping in motion.” Hence the moped on the cover.While many other MCs are world-makers with their lyrics and themes, there’s a feeling that, when you listen to Manga spit, he’s in conversation with his listeners, inviting them into his world to share his experience. “It’s my clearest project in terms of the message I’m trying to convey, and I’m happy that people are collectively understanding,” he says. Even on the more explosive tracks such as Trample, the sharpness in his tone makes it feel like he’s speaking directly to you: “First things first, let me say from now we are not similar  I am not like dem,” he raps. And so it proves: whether fretting about the grim financial realities of an independent artist on Less Money More Problems or struggling with bouts of depression on Escape Plan, he touches on topics other MCs sometimes shy away from. His writing is purposeful, precise and often funny, and each word has its place as he challenges the idea of a single narrative within grime.As he says on Black Man Timing, “not giving a fuck is my skincare routine”, but this clarity of purpose came out of a long stretch in the wilderness. “I felt lost for a long time – there wasn’t any direction in my life,” he says. As one of the younger members of Roll Deep alongside some big personalities, he arguably joined ahead of his time – too early, in fact. “There are people like Wiley who just get it and have that energy. But I was lost in every area of life and I didn’t know what I was doing. I wasn’t earning anything really, I wasn’t making any impact, but at the same time I wasn’t doing enough. I wasn’t very good, and sometimes I wondered whether I should’ve got a job. It was a struggle back then. As I got older, I learned more about myself.”Each project since has encapsulated each stage in his life, gradually adding more detail to an overall portrait of a man. “I have the room to talk about my fears and insecurities about finding my place in the world,” he says. “There’s no extra songs recorded when I make a body of work – the first line you heard is the first thing I wrote, and it’s the same with the last. Everything in that project is me. That’s why I feel it’s sick when people tell me they like certain songs, it’s like there’s an understanding on a deeper level.”Manga’s name as a solo artist has only blown up in the last five years or so, following those years he spent figuring out what kind of MC he wanted to be. His golden age could unexpectedly come in his mid-30s. “I just wanted to tell my story and now people have gravitated towards me, from me being myself,” he says. “I’ve got nothing to pretend about any more. I’ve learned more about myself and the more I speak about the realities, the more people see me as Manga and not just a grime MC. I don’t have to play a character.” Grime’s wallflower will continue to blossom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites.

She told reporters:The fact we are describing this as a “row” should make us all take a long hard look at ourselves ... Other countries are just doing what they need to do in a public health sense to stop transmission of virus.The fact that in Scotland we are trying to turn this into a standard political constitutional row – and I’m saying we to be charitable because it isnae me - is frankly disgraceful.Addressing Johnson, Scottish secretary Alister Jack and other critics directly, she said: “If you find yourselves trying to turn any of this into a political or constitutional row go and take a long hard look at yourself in a mirror.”At PMQs, in response to a question from a Scottish Conservative MP, Johnson said that he found the idea of visitors from England being quarantined “astonishing” and that there was no border between the two countries. (See 12.15pm.) Asked to respond to Johnson’s comments, Sturgeon was palpably frustrated, describing them as “absurd and ridiculous political statements”. She went on:For a prime minister to try to politicise these things is shameful and unacceptable.Pointing to the announcement by the governor of New York that he would quarantine visitors from particular states, she said: I don’t think the governor of New York is being political or constitutional – he’s trying to protect the people he serves from being exposed to the spread of the virus.She said that she would be failing in her duty not to consider cross-border quarantines if her scientific advisers suggested it.Anybody you hear trying to turn this into a proxy debate about Scottish independence or the constitution, they are the one who are being reckless and failing the public health test.Her comments come as national clinical director Jason Leitch confirmed a “cross-border cluster” of coronavirus infections around Gretna and Annan, right on the border between Scotland and England (the one Boris Johnson just said at PMQs doesn’t exist).Sturgeon described it as a “sharp reminder for us that the virus is still out there”.Leitch said that the cluster was currently in single figures and was complex because some tests were done in England and some in Scotland. The infections are not thought to be linked to a particular event. He said that Public Health Scotland and Public Health England have put together a cross border incident management team already, adding that clusters were much easier to deal with than sustained community transmission. “This is exactly what we expected to happen at this stage in the pandemic.”You can tell a major political announcement has misfired when it has to be rewritten 24 hours later. Yesterday Boris Johnson gave a major speech on his plans for economic recovery, and in so far as the headline writers were concerned, he was announcing a £5bn investment package. By today, by the alchemy of political spin, that has now metamorphosed into a £600bn spending package. The press release yesterday did say that what the PM was announcing was part of £640bn investment package for the next five years set out in the budget in February, but the headline writers ignored that because it was not new, or even crisis-related. Why was Johnson trying to retrospectively increasing the price tag on his big speech by more than a hundred-fold? Because he was getting pummelled by Sir Keir Starmer. Johnson introduced the figure at the end of their exchanges, when Starmer was making the quite reasonable point that what was announced yesterday would not be much use to those in the hospitality or retail sector losing their jobs now. Johnson’s best moment of the exchanges came when he was able to boast about what has already been done to protect 11m jobs, but he did not have a decent answer to Starmer’s point about jobs being lost now, which is when he resorted to magic numbers.The early exchanges went even more badly for Johnson. He was not quite as evasive as he was last week, but his claim that the government did act in a timely manner in Leicester was wholly unconvincing and Starmer managed to refute what Johnson said about pillar 2 information being shared with Leicester without even trying. Starmer’s most effective question was his third, when he accused Johnson of being too flippant on a matter of life or death. He said:Johnson responded by claiming that somehow the question was illegitimate - always a sign that an attack his hitting. Perhaps Johnson would be better off if he just resorted to humility and total honest (although god help the person at the No 10 meeting who suggests that).Unlike Starmer, Johnson is a deft phrase-maker and he put his talent to use in the slogan he used in his peroration. He said:We’re the builders, they’re the blockers. We’re the doers, they’re the ditherers. We’re going to get on with it and take this country forward.In other circumstances (particularly in a full chamber, with Tory MPs cheering), this might have been effective. But to have any bite, a slogan has to be at least half-true and a prime minister who has repeatedly been accused of dithering over coronavirus (most importantly over lockdown in March now over Leicester) really needs to cultivate a better line of attack. Starmer is averse to these sort of alliterative jingles, and at PMQs has repeatedly been understated rather than overstated. But this can make what he says all the more powerful, as when he labelled Johnson “flippant” on a matter of life and death. It was a clear hit.Johnson says the Department for Education has been working with the Department for Transport on ensuring children can use buses to return to school in the autumn.And PMQs is now over. Snap verdict coming up soon.Johnson says he does think there are issues with the way the DBS criminal record check scheme works. He agrees to look at this.Johnson says as soon as nail bars can open in a way that is Covid secure, they will be allowed to open.Labour’s Stephen Timms asks if non-universal credit benefits should be raised in value in line with the increase applied to universal credit. (Some people are still on the “legacy benefits” because they have not yet moved over to UC.)Johnson accepts that Timms has been a strong campaigner on this, but refuses to make this pledge. He just quotes figures for how much UC has increased.Labour’s Siobhain McDonagh ask about children on free school meals. If the PM is sincere about wanting to level up, will he support a bill to ensure all children on free school meals get internet access.Johnson says he supports this aim. But the most important thing now is to get pupils back to school. It is disappointing that Labour has not unequivocally backed children going back, he says.The DUP’s Ian Paisley says it was good to see the PM at a Christians in parliament event yesterday. Will the government invest in hydrogen-powered buses (some of which are made in Northern Ireland).Johnson says he is a big fan of buses made in Northern Ireland.Jason McCartney, a Conservative, asks if the government will replenish arts council funds so that the creative sector can be supported.Johnson says the house is speaking with one voice this morning. But, as we open up, we must be careful. He says the theatres will reopen, but in a Covid secure way.Labour’s Stephen Doughty asks about job losses in South Wales and elsewhere. Workers do not want slogans. They want to know what the PM will do to protect their jobs in the long term.Johnson says he recognises that people are worried about their jobs. That is why they have a £600bn investment programme, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1c8e21d95fe9bef9eed866bbbcce4d3951071f/97_0_1480_889/master/1480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ea3f318dcde7ebbbed903e6ca0319e","title":"ten years of the sun in one hour nasa releases mesmerising space film","story":"The space agency gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, which have now been stitched together to form the videoNasa has released a mesmerising timelapse video of the sun that condenses an entire solar cycle into an hour of footage, using images of the star taken every hour continuously over a decade.Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory has gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, from its launch in February 2010 until June this year, which have now been stitched together to form the video.While the 20 million gigabytes of picture data captured over the decade have contributed to “countless new discoveries about the workings” of the sun, according to Nasa, the images have now been arranged into a 61-minute video showing events including transiting planets and eruptions.The film shows the major changes the sun undergoes during a solar cycle, an approximately 11-year period which sees the sun’s north and south poles flip, and the emergence of sunspots as a result of gas altering the star’s magnetic fields.Every second of the 61-minute video represents images taken over a single day, with the first frame showing the sun on 2 June 2010, and the last frame captured on 1 June 2020.With what Nasa describes as a “triad of instruments”, the SDO took a picture of the sun every 0.75 seconds on average, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument that captured images “every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light”.However, not every image the SDO has taken has been used in the timelapse video. Only images taken at one wavelength, 17.1 nanometres, were used in the video, with the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of the images allowing for the sun’s golden yellow, outermost atmospheric layer – the corona – to be visible.Nasa commissioned German musician Lars Leonhard to compose Solar Observe to accompany the video.In a statement released with the video, Nasa explained why there were a few blank frames in the video and the infrequent changes of focus away from the sun.“While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed toward the sun, there have been a few moments it missed,” it said. “The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun.”Nasa also explained that a “longer blackout” in the footage in 2016 was caused by a temporary AIA instrument issue that took a week to fix.“The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments,” Nasa said.The SDO mission is expected to continue observing the sun until 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b78963d519bd121e8beb9e5e6a7db6e46f19155/0_30_6428_3858/master/6428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d3037245fa6daaf30eb5b318385ed7","title":"nearly half of bame uk households are living in poverty","story":"Campaigners found that 100,000 more people were living in poverty in 2018-19 compared with the previous yearBlack and minority ethnic (BAME) households in the UK are over twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts, leaving them disproportionately exposed to job losses and pay cuts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, an independent study has revealed.The latest annual report by the Social Metrics Commission found that nearly half of Black African Caribbean households were in poverty, compared with just under one in five white families, while BAME families as a whole were between two and three times as likely to be in persistent poverty than white households.“With the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus likely to last long after the health crisis is over, these results show how far we have to go to improve the lives of the most disadvantaged in society,” said the commission’s chair, the Conservative peer Philippa Stroud.Stroud said more work was urgently needed to understand why BAME households were disproportionately likely to live in poverty, and what solutions would drive improvements, from skills and work opportunities to housing. “We should be looking to level up for the BAME community,” she said.The commission said BAME households were more likely to be in deep poverty than white families – around one in 10 adults from a Black British, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or mixed background were unemployed, compared with one in 25 white British people – and so were more likely to suffer heightened financial exposure to the pandemic.Zubaida Haque, interim director of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said Covid-19 had disproportionately hit BAME families both in health terms and income. “I agree with Baroness Stroud that we should level up – and that means short-term increases to universal credit and child benefit to lift people out of poverty and in-work poverty, and long-term solutions around affordable housing and skills.”“These impacts on those already in poverty and just above the poverty line threaten to increase the number of people in poverty and deepen poverty for those already experiencing it,” the commission said.Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and a member of the commission, said: “For a society that values compassion and justice, news that the proportion of people locked in deep poverty has increased over the last 20 years must act as wake-up call. That the pandemic has also hit those living in deep poverty hardest only sharpens the need for urgent action.”Sam Royston, director of policy and research at the Children’s Society, said: “These new figures – which show that nearly a third of people in poverty are living on less than half what they would need simply to get above the poverty line – should appal us all.”The Social Metrics Commission was set up in 2016 to develop a new way of measuring poverty.

But there are also more modern examples, including what Dr Sami Timimi, a signatory and visiting professor at the University of Lincoln and fellow of the college, highlighted as “perceptions of black dangerousness”.The stereotype has been much discussed in relation to law enforcement, especially in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which began over the US police killing of George Floyd, but Timimi said it also existed in mental health services.“That is still very prevalent in our culture and therefore – not surprisingly – it’s very prevalent in the way we apply our psychiatric technologies,” he said. “So what we see is the label of schizophrenia, which is meant to be the worst type of psychosis that you can have, and is meant to be something with a very poor outlook, it’s disproportionately applied to black people, particularly black men.”He also cited the fact that black people in England were four times more likely than white people to be detained under the Mental Health Act.As another example, he said that when he started his first consultant job in an area of east London with a large Muslim population, a senior clinician told him the best they could do for the young Asian women they were seeing with mental health issues was “to save them from their culture”.Timimi said that while the police had been talking about institutional racism since the MacPherson report after the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the conversation had been lacking in the field of mental health. He said the training curriculum was not overtly racist, but defined what is normal “through the standards of the dominant culture”, which he said was also being exported overseas.James acknowledged ongoing institutional racism in the NHS and announced two presidential leads – Dr Lade Smith and Dr Raj Mohan – to develop a race equality action plan.Mohan said: “Systemic racism is something we can overcome with understanding and action. We want to see an end to people being detained or sectioned because they don’t get help until they’re in crisis. That means tackling social inequalities and stigma in society and providing culturally sensitive services, designed around the needs of local communities.”The signatories want James to go further and set up an independent commission containing service users and experts to examine all training curricula and practice guidelines that the college produces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a87b88ec22cca1263511ec105f1900d7cfbd22c0/0_54_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e21385fc78324e82b3872e11e6b920","title":"uk libraries reopen not as we know them","story":"Space marshalls at the door, librarians behind perspex screens ... book borrowing may never be the same againUK libraries will start to reopen from 4 July. But anyone hoping to pop in and browse the bookshelves, take their child to rhymetime or spend a couple of hours using the computers is going to be disappointed.“We have the capacity for 20 people at a time,” says Rachel Braithwaite, project development manager at the Archibald Corbett Library in south London, which will, unlike many other libraries, be opening its doors from 4 July and restarting at least some former activities. “There will be a space marshall and hand sanitiser at the door. Everyone feels differently. People who would be worried won’t come. But personally I’m looking forward to it.”Returned books will be put into crates and quarantined for 72 hours. As for browsing, there may be a system whereby any books that have been touched and not borrowed have to go into quarantine it’s still to be decided. But the system to check books out is in place: librarians will be behind perspex screens, through which library cards can be scanned.During lockdown online library services have been booming, but it’s also important, says Braithwaite, to offer more than online services. For the past three weeks, the library has provided a click and collect service – and only one book order has so far been put in. “A lot of our customers are people without access to computers. If we do things like click and collect, or online activities, that won’t reach them,” she explains. “We want people to come in and get books.”Community services will also be available, including helping people without digital access fill in online forms for benefits such as bus passes or universal credit. “We’ve already started those services, out at the back of the library, on the decking. We now plan to move that into a room, with distancing and personal protective equipment,” says Braithwaite. Classes in English for speakers of other languages will also restart, and there will be access to four of the library’s usual nine PCs.Over the past 10 years of austerity, libraries have become vital community hubs, agrees councillor James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council. “We have put a lot more services into libraries – credit unions, job shops, even post offices,” he says. Of the 34 libraries in and around Leeds, six will initially reopen, but there will be no book browsing. Computers will be available, but will have to be booked for 45-minute sessions. Even this limited amount of reopening has taken “painstaking” work, he says.As they gradually reopen, all UK libraries will have to put strict measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and users, including physical distancing and measures such as booking computers in advance. Dates vary around the UK. Libraries in England are able to reopen from 4 July libraries in Scotland from 15 July and in Northern Ireland from 20 July. In Wales, the next review of lockdown measures will be on 13 July until then, some libraries already offer a click and collect service and many are planning how to reopen with limited services.In most areas, it’s the larger libraries, more easily able to provide physical distancing, that are reopening first. In Nottinghamshire, for instance, library spaces have been reorganised with no access to study space, toilets, refreshment areas and no activities.“A lot of us realise that the services we are used to will only come back gradually,” says Portsmouth councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who chairs the culture, tourism and sport committee of the Local Government Association. Many library staff have kept in touch with their users, particularly older and more vulnerable residents, but not everyone will know the new rules. “For some people, that message won’t get to them until they go to the library and talk to staff,” he acknowledges. “There will be teething issues, but I expect people will be OK when things are explained to them.”Lewis agrees. “Trying to get back safely the places where people get together, like libraries, sports centres, museums and galleries, is really frustrating. There’s been nothing like this in anyone’s lifetime, so we didn’t expect government to figure it out to the last penny,” he says. “But we don’t see any extra money. We are already starting the process of service reviews to reduce spending, including potential compulsory redundancies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6e67acc03717a1b8fd3541222f99647b3facfa/145_128_2542_1525/master/2542.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a2cb8329c54b55125cda905ecc27b904","title":"talking horses ben curtis plans friday prep ride on first derby mount","story":"Weeks after his first Royal Ascot success, this weekend will bring another thrill for jockey whose star is on the riseBen Curtis will be introduced to his Derby mount, Highland Chief, on Friday morning when the jockey who has made so much progress in recent years will make a flying visit to the Whatcombe stables of Paul and Oliver Cole. It is a huge moment for Curtis, who was just a year old when Cole Sr won the Derby with Generous in 1991.“It’s absolutely brilliant,” he told me before racing on Tuesday. “It’s the phone call any jockey wants to receive and, in a year when the Derby looks very open, he looks to have a fantastic chance. I’m really looking forward to it.“I’m going down to sit on him on Friday morning. I’ve obviously watched all his races. He looks like a horse who’s progressing with every run and goes into the Derby with what I think is a live chance.”It is hard for any jockey to break into the big time by sheer riding talent but Curtis is getting there, with the help of a canny agent in Simon Dodds. His 98 winners for the year is 41 ahead of his nearest rival and he’s second-favourite to be champion jockey, behind only Oisin Murphy.Somehow the difficult transition has to be managed from quantity to quality and there again Curtis is making progress. He has ridden three Group winners since resumption this month, doubling his career tally. They include his first Royal Ascot success.“You can ride plenty of winners on a day to day basis but you need to get some of those bigger winners to put you in the shop window. I was lucky enough to get on a better calibre of horse over the last few years and get the job done. People seem to have noticed, so it’s all paying off.”Curtis will be at Catterick on Thursday afternoon and Haydock on Friday. Introducing a trip to Whatcombe, just outside Lambourn, in between the two is no joke in terms of the miles to be covered, but Curtis will be as happy to do it as any jockey would be. Highland Chief kept on very strongly to win his Ascot handicap off a mark of 101 and his Derby chance is worth any amount of driving.It’s tough on Rossa Ryan that he doesn’t get to keep the ride after being on board Highland Chief at Ascot. But, at 19, he has 11 years on Curtis and his chance will come if he sticks at it as the older man has done.For any readers who need to be reminded of their age, consider that Ryan was born in the year Galileo won the Derby and was almost certainly too young to be paying any attention when Frankie Dettori got his first Derby success on Authorized in 2007.Hooray for jump racing, which makes its return at Southwell today. A 12-runner novice handicap chase is possibly not the gentle introduction that some of the jockeys may have been hoping for, but I dare say they’ll cope.Nineohtwooneoh (12.00) is the one to be with, even at odds of 2-1. He’s had his problems but scored over hurdles at Musselburgh in February in the manner of a horse who was well ahead of his rating, and the 10lb higher mark he is on now still underestimates him.He can be forgiven a subsequent blow-out at Taunton, when the heavy going did not suit and which may possibly have come too soon. He can get Paul Nicholls’s summer off to a flyer.Oxwich Bay, the second favourite, is a horse worth keeping an eye on for some future gig. But winning at Southwell in summer usually takes a modicum of pace, which he lacks.Chapmanshype (3.10) is fairly priced at 5-1 for quite a hot handicap hurdle. Jamie Snowden’s runner has won his last three but may not be done yet and this is his ground. Among the opposition is Hunters Call, who helped put Olly Murphy on the map by landing the valuable handicap hurdle at Ascot’s pre-Christmas meeting three years ago. He has not raced since.Tommy Rock (5.10) should be able to defy a penalty at Kempton tonight. Clive Cox’s grey may have learned quite a bit from his strong-finishing handicap debut at Wolverhampton last week. He’s 15-8."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c85d7a0c35c0412a3b5e53778da347261ed07bbe/0_139_4748_2848/master/4748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beb59d68c2f939c893d1311f959e849a","title":"danny sapani we must teach the truth about british history","story":"The actor, who stars in the National Theatre’s stream of Les Blancs, says schools must acknowledge the damage done by colonialism – to strengthen the bonds of a multicultural societyIt is a historical play about colonial oppression and the struggle for African independence but is it also a political play for now?Yes it is. I think most of our history needs to be revised, and that’s just what Lorraine Hansberry did in this play. There are so many aspects of history she talks about in Les Blancs that have still not been acknowledged, that are not common knowledge and that have not been apologised for. As a result, aspects of colonial things in everyday life remain. Even the fact that we are talking about “black lives matter” is a hangover from imperialist thinking when black lives didn’t matter.We need to educate our children about British history it can’t just be about the Fire of London, the Tudors and the great things Britain has done. Let’s talk about the things that have not been great, too. This history explains why we have a multicultural Britain now it is a result of what happened in the past.I feel there has to be an absolute drive to educate ourselves and each other about the truth of our history and the stories that did not seem relevant to a world where George Floyd could be killed in cold blood, but are relevant in the new world we will build together.Have you been to any of the Black Lives Matter protests?I have been around the local protest with my children, wearing masks and social distancing. We made our stand and I wanted to educate my children about what is essential in their lives and their friends’ lives. It’s not just black people fighting racism now but white people as well. It’s about being anti-racist and following it up with action.The notion of home is complicated too Africans are oppressed in their homeland and Tshembe has made his home in Europe, but he becomes uncertain when he returns.His loyalties are completely split but there is no room for that duality in revolution.

Which one are you missing the most?TV is something I enjoy as a viewer and as a creative but what I miss the most at the moment is being able to sit in a room with a bunch of people and see a play or listen to a lecture or a piece of music. That community and live experience can’t be replicated in any other way. There’s a real need to put pressure on the government but also find local ways to support theatre that has been so horribly affected by lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8e1cac3b845e09e58602f0eae25701b7380d91d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf39a03f5d06d53d83489ba9c3a4624","title":"joking around belfast northern ireland standup comedy","story":"It’s the only place in the world where jokes about local councillors work. But is Belfast’s sharp-tongued comedy circuit becoming less hostile to outsiders?Patrick Kielty’s first Belfast standup set won him a keg of beer. It was freshers’ week 1989 at Queen’s University and his housemates had nominated him for a talent competition. As well as the booze, he earned a termly gig on campus, but across Belfast comedy barely existed.Until, that is, BBC producer Jackie Hamilton approached him with an idea: The Empire Laughs Back, the city’s first dedicated comedy night. “There was no scene, so we decided to make it,” Kielty says.The venue, the Belfast Empire, was in a “beautiful sweet spot” on a neutral street between loyalist and nationalist parts of town. “When we set the comedy club up it was 1992, the ceasefire wasn’t until 1994, so there was an edge to it,” Kielty says. “The very first night, we weren’t sure how many people would turn up – 400 queued around the corner.”Hamilton brought acts from London – big names such as Jeremy Hardy and Lee Evans – but Kielty became the weekly compere. With barely 15 minutes of material, the news offered inspiration: “It led to my style being much more satirical and political.”In October 1992, the Shankill bombing and Greysteel massacre forced Belfast to shut down. But the Empire remained open. “The place was packed. The thirst to have somebody talk about what was going on was really great,” Kielty says.The Empire set the tone for Belfast standup, unleashing a desire for comedy that gave Northern Ireland a voice, with Kielty at the heart. When Colin Murphy, who began standup in 1993, took over as MC at the Empire, he remembers the struggle to win over the crowd: “They didn’t come to see the acts, they came to see Paddy. The applause would stop before you got to the microphone when they realised you weren’t Paddy.”Murphy was one of only a few Belfast standups at that time. “It wasn’t a culture that existed,” he says. “There was nowhere to do it.”The Empire Laughs Back is still going strong and is supplemented by open mics, monthly gigs led by inidual comedians, and regular shows at arts venues, including the Black Box, and bars such as the Sunflower and Pug Uglys.“The scene here has gotten quite good,” says Belfast comic Teresa Livingstone. “There’s certainly a lot more people doing it.”A former music teacher, Livingstone started comedy seven years ago and began writing songs in character as a woman at the end of a long night out. She was one of the few Belfast acts moving away from traditional standup.Some of them skipped open mics entirely. Colin Geddis’s wannabe ultimate fighter, Barry the Blender, and Paddy Raff’s posh caricature, Nigel, gained fans online. Both recently sold out shows at Belfast’s SSE Arena.Livingstone has also seen a shift away from talking about sectarianism: “People are like, ‘Right, that’s never going away, but what else is there?’ They’re able to talk more about themselves.”But Belfast audiences are still politically astute. “It’s the only place where you could do a joke about a local councillor and most of the room would get it,” says standup Sarah Firby.“Audiences here still like local stuff,” says Murphy, who now mostly tours theatres and is a stalwart of panel show The Blame Game. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be about politics, just something about us, because we don’t see it anywhere else. Until Derry Girls, you didn’t hear our accents making jokes on TV.”That desire to see yourself reflected led Firby to set up Coven Comedy Club in 2019, a monthly gig passing the mic to women and LGBTQ comedians. Although Belfast has produced standups such as Nuala McKeever and Mary Flanigan, its scene is still male-dominated. “A lot of women and queer people didn’t feel there was much for them,” Firby says. “If you’ve got more Connors on the bill than women, you’re not hearing a huge amount of variety.”For a while, says Kielty, “if you didn’t have something to say about what was going on in Northern Ireland, people didn’t want to hear it. We focused life into this binary prism. The fact that that prism is disappearing means the full breadth of comedy can be developed.”Audience response to Coven has been “amazing”, Firby says. She’s now planning workshops to encourage more women and LGBTQ people to try standup. “Whenever you’re talking about inclusivity, people go, ‘There aren’t any women comedians.’ I thought I’d try to bring other people up and create an environment where they feel confident.”Across the growing variety of comedy, there are still common themes. “Slagging each other off is almost a way of communicating here,” says Livingstone. “It’s taken in good humour, but there’s a real sarcastic, ‘Aye, brilliant, well done.’”Murphy says: “There is a viciousness here that to the outsider can be frightening and a familiarity with people we don’t know. We, within minutes, will become overly familiar to the level that we think we can roast someone.”In the 90s, that came from audiences, too. “The Belfast audience wanted to join in,” Murphy says. “The Empire used to be infamous – in England, people were terrified of coming here.”There’s also been a willingness to embrace darkness. “Even Roy Walker,” says Murphy. “In his material there were undertones of doom.”When live comedy starts again, Kielty hopes we’ll hear more from Belfast comics. “I’d like to see more Belfast performers getting a crack at it across the UK,” he says. “There are comedic stories that the rest of the country needs to hear – bigger social issues that are currently Northern Irish stories. There is a youth and an energy in that city. The best days are still ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2bd543ed0f0418942cc7337987ce62eb7c106ec/0_125_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e8be70543359ff6d129f13947f2ae90","title":"uk theatres reopen food films not live plays civic duty","story":"Artistic directors say it’s a ‘civic duty’ to open up as their venues play a vital role for their communities beyond entertainmentThe easing of coronavirus restrictions means that from 4 July, UK theatres and arts centres are permitted to reopen their doors. But there’s a significant snag: government guidance states these venues should not stage live performance. If they can’t put on a show, why would theatres open at all?“It would be significantly cheaper to keep the doors closed,” admits Alex Clifton, artistic director of Chester’s Storyhouse, which will welcome back people from this Saturday. Visitors will find a theatre repurposed as a cinema, with physically distanced seating. The complex’s original cinema screen, library and restaurant will also open. But it’s about more than offering entertainment and a bite to eat – it’s a civic duty, says Clifton. “People are desperate for contact again, to get back into community spaces, where they feel safe and connected.” Putting on plays, he argues, is “not our mission. We put on plays in service of our mission.”In Manchester, Home – which marked its fifth birthday in May during lockdown – is also a multi-artform venue. It plans to reopen its cinema, bars and restaurant on 4 September, with the gallery and theatre spaces to follow later. In preparation for when live performance is permitted, the management team are exploring how the audience can be socially distanced in the 500-seat main theatre. One plan is to reduce the capacity by three-quarters and move the programme of work from Home’s smaller 150-seat black-box theatre into the bigger space. Contactless ticketing will be introduced and there are protective screens at the box office. “We’ve got a civic responsibility to open as much as we can – to bring life back into the city,” says Dave Moutrey, Home’s director and CEO.At ARC in Stockton-on-Tees, in the north-east, artistic director and chief executive Annabel Turpin agrees that “we genuinely feel we have a responsibility to the communities we serve”. That includes creatives themselves. “Lots of artists use our building to make work.” The centre’s resident learning-disabled theatre company, Full Circle, and a host of professional organisations and iniduals are all “keen to get back in”. ARC aims to use its financial reserves to reopen in September. The argument must be made to government, says Turpin, that arts centres don’t just want a bailout – they can play a vital role in getting people back into work. “With financial support, we can be paying our freelance artists.” As well as the economic benefits of those freelancers being in work, their activities “will reach the people in our communities that often don’t get to access culture. So there are social benefits, too.”Turpin says government guidance for theatres during the pandemic has been frustrating because it is based on “the assumption we are mini versions of these national institutions – so if you’re a theatre in Keswick, for example, you’re a mini version of the National Theatre. That’s not the case – we operate entirely differently.”ARC plans to reopen with a programme of classes, workshops, creative learning activities and exhibitions. Turpin stresses that there may be a process of building confidence for some people to return but she reports that the only negative feedback from regulars so far is “they wish it was sooner”. Shutting the doors of their venue felt like ripping the heart out of Stockton, she says. “The pandemic has shown how embedded arts centres are in their communities.”Theatres’ outreach and participatory work, which often gets overlooked, is central to the recently launched Public Campaign for the Arts, which highlights the human value of the sector. Rather than making familiar arguments about how theatre contributes towards economic growth, the grassroots campaign emphasises the positive benefits for mental health and helping people express themselves.Derby theatre’s artistic director, Sarah Brigham, agrees the arts can play a vital role in helping heal the national “wound” caused by coronavirus. She points out that her theatre never really closed, in that its work has continued in the community – such as delivering food parcels. Brigham is planning two major initiatives to ease people out of lockdown and ensure they don’t see the theatre as a “place of danger”. Ghost Light will be a site-specific performance for one household at a time. Audiences will be taken on a tour through the venue to watch a handful of short new pieces performed by actors exploring the craft and purpose of theatre. The aim is to involve the audience themselves in shaping the future of the venue.The theatre is also planning a bread-making event, Derby Rises, in the city’s market place, with participants kneading dough en masse. It will be a ritual of sorts, like theatre itself, says Brigham, and there will be moments of performance throughout. She recalls how, in the early days of the lockdown, customers stockpiled loaves, leaving shelves empty. Now, they can make them side by side – a symbolic celebration before they can return to the stalls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73134cfbb2e1828285b2a986745c190d6c02aef/134_0_1799_1080/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00aec61a3a4ef70804d07b62a6d3902","title":"germanys new sculpture garden the perfect post lockdown attraction","story":" A contemporary art collection in the grounds of a castle north-west of Berlin is a bold addition for a quiet part of BrandenburgDr Loretta Würtenberger – tall and clad in a flowing black summer dress – greets me with a casual coronavirus-style elbow-bump on the grounds of her new home, Schlossgut Schwante: an 18th-century baroque castle she bought with her husband Daniel Tümpel last year. Both well-established in the art market, the couple have transformed the castle grounds into a sculpture park featuring works by German and international artists, such as Tony Cragg, Maria Loboda, Dan Graham, Hans Arp, and Carsten Nicolai.It’s a bold, perhaps even radical, new attraction for this sleepy part of the Brandenburg region, around 25km north-west of Berlin, and an ideal post-lockdown cultural destination. Alongside the sculpture park, the couple have created a restaurant with a rustic, intimate interior, a large patio with an outdoor kitchen and a quaint wagon selling artisanal ice-cream. A farm shop sells handmade crockery, art books, cookbooks and local produce perfect for on-site picnics. An events programme includes open-air film screenings, outdoor yoga classes, concerts and lectures.“If someone had told me 18 months ago that I would be doing all this, and having this conversation with you right now, I would have said they were crazy,” says Loretta as she leads me through the restaurant and into the park. “We bought it from a friend, with no real intention of creating a sculpture park. But we wanted to maintain the house as the centre of a dynamic entity rather than a scenic backdrop. Since there’s no big agriculture here any more, and we are not farmers, art was the answer.”The baroque main building, which now serves as a private home for the couple and their four children, is said to have been designed by fabulously named Georg Wenceslas von Knobelsdorff, one of Frederick the Great’s favoured architects. It was constructed in the early 1740s for the von Redern family, generations of whom lived here until the 1880s. The vicissitudes of 20th-century Germany saw it used as a hospital and a DDR kindergarten.The garden is the estate’s pièce de résistance, though. Originally designed in the English style popular at the time, it now combines landscaped and wilded sections dotted with fruit trees (cherries, plums, apples), as well as pendulous willows, proud (and fragrant) linden trees – and more than 20 international artworks placed up trees, in ponds, and semi-hidden within thickets.It’s a fun way to enjoy art, and some pieces are additionally interactive, such as Dan Graham’s 2018 Play Pen for Play Pals, which combines stainless steel, glass and a two-way mirror to allow the viewer to merge, ghost-like, with the surroundings, and Carsten Nicolai’s cast-iron sound installation Echo, which mimics a meditation temple, encouraging visitors to thump their chests and listen for the reverberation from different places.A stainless steel corkscrew-style sculpture in a field turns out to be a 2012 work by Tony Cragg, whose own sculpture park near Wuppertal is perhaps the only similar project to this one in Germany. A small field of aluminium flowers that shimmy and chime with the wind and rain is by Berlin-based Japanese artist Toshihiko Mitsuya, who comes each week to clip the grass and plant new flowers. A much-darker note is struck by Polish artist Monika Sosnowska’s Stairs 2019, a crumpled black staircase that lies in the grass like a malevolent bug.But overall the park is a welcoming and graceful place, embellished with strategically placed Sissinghurst benches (with graceful arched backs), hammocks strung between trees, and a circular hedged area with a small pond and several day beds.“It’s about creating a space where art has no barrier,” says Loretta. “It’s not a white cube. It’s something where nature and art merges and families can come and enjoy.” Since opening, the site has drawn hundreds of visitors, including many families, a positive surprise for the owners, especially during these difficult times. On the way out, I spy another artwork rising from the lake – a neon sign by Martin Creed that reads Everything Is Going To Be Alright.

Of Victoria’s cases, only three were from hotel quarantine, with community transmission becoming a growing concern in the state over the past fortnight. The source of 42 of Victoria’s newest cases remains under investigation.The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Wednesday that the work of public health officials door-knocking the most affected suburbs and offering people free testing was now a key part of the state’s strategy to bring the spread under control.“I can report to you that as of last night we had knocked on some 54,000 doors in those high-risk suburbs and postcodes offering advice, testing information and in some cases the self-administering test kits where people can take the test and it can be collected at a later point,” he said. “There will be further door-knocking, quite intensive door-knocking and there will be an update to this end each and every day.”Maidstone and Broadmeadows are the focus of this door-knocking on Wednesday, with and Albanvale and Brunswick West to be targeted on Thursday. Twelve new testing sites will be established across the 10 hotspot postcodes, which include 36 suburbs, facing lockdown.“In terms of those lockdown suburbs I again make the point I know and understand that this will be deeply inconvenient,” Andrews said. “It will be frustrating, it will be very challenging. We will be there to support each and every business that’s impacted, not just with within the zone but also the tourism businesses where there will be bookings that will have to be cancelled because of these lockdowns.”He said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, supported the measures, including the ersion of international flights to other states after breaches were identified in infection control in Victoria’s hotel quarantine program. Further announcements were expected on Wednesday afternoon about support for affected businesses, as well as how the lockdowns will be enforced.“Ultimately, if I didn’t shut down those postcodes I’d be shutting down all postcodes and I don’t think we want to get to that point,” Andrews said. “We all want to work hard, literally day and night to try and avoid that sort of an outcome.”It comes as the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced any Victorian from one of the hotspot suburbs entering NSW faces fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ jail. Residents from his state face the same penalties if they go to one of the 36 suburbs.“Victorians living in virus hotspots have to take the Victorian and NSW health orders seriously and should be very aware that NSW will impose additional penalties if they seek to leave their suburbs to enter NSW,” he said.NSW has further eased its social distancing restrictions from Wednesday, with limits on attendance for funerals, weddings, places of worship and community sport relaxed as long as there is no more than one person for every 4 sq m of space.Outdoor gatherings are still restricted to 20 people but community sport with a Covid-19 safety plan can have up to 500 participants. Funerals, weddings and church services may have the maximum number of people allowed on the premises, with one person for every 4 square metres. All businesses can now open and operate under the same principle.The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, reiterated on Wednesday that the states borders were reopening from 10 July except to Victorians.Of the new cases identified in Victoria overnight, five additional staff members have been linked to the outbreak at Al Taqwa College in Truganina, taking the total to eight staff at the school. The cases are linked to previous outbreaks in Sunshine West and Truganina.Two new cases are part of the Stamford Plaza Hotel outbreak where returned travellers are being kept in quarantine, taking the total to 31. One is a security guard in quarantine and the other is a household contact of a confirmed case. On Tuesday Andrews said a number of Victoria’s cases through late May and early June had been linked through genomic testing to an infection control breach in the hotel quarantine program, prompting him to call for a judicial inquiry.Victoria’s chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said: “This virus is not selective”.“It will impact anyone it encounters, and personal contact is the clear source of its transmission.” He said for people living in hotspots, “There is no excuse for not getting tested”. From midnight, for people living outside the restricted postcodes, there are only four reasons to go into those postcodes will be shopping for food and supplies, care and caregiving, exercise and study or work. People who live in these postcodes cannot have visitors to their home, or visit other homes, except for caregiving or compassionate reasons, or receiving services.Businesses and facilities in these postcodes that have reopened will again be restricted. Cafes and restaurants will only be able to open for take-away and delivery services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5ccccc1d87c0e13a6cfb1158a8d61a358bf261/0_48_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591bb57dc325cbd4b7c29a2e1c0a13a3","title":"data reveals coronavirus hotspots in bradford barnsley and rochdale","story":"Exclusive: figures reveal locations with highest levels of new infections after LeicesterBradford, Barnsley and Rochdale can be revealed as the places with the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester, as fears grow of further local outbreaks and the UK heads towards Saturday’s lifting of more lockdown restrictions.The official data, which has not been previously published on Public Health England’s online dashboard, comes amid complaints from local health officials and medics that a lack of detailed testing about local outbreaks is causing delays in attempts to curtail them.It also raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities, with seven out of 10 of the worst affected areas being in Yorkshire and Lancashire, including some of the most ethnically erse parts of the country.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country. Figures from Public Health England now show that rate was even higher in the east Midlands city – just over 140 – in the week ending the previous Thursday, 25 June.Bradford’s rate for that week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures which gather together both tests primarily in NHS settings and of healthcare workers and tests carried out in people’s homes and in the community.The two strands are known as pillar-one and pillar-two testing.However, only the pillar-one testing is used in PHE’s online coronavirus dashboard, meaning that the majority of cases in the worst-hit areas are being left off this data. This data did not show that as far back as the week beginning 1 June, PHE knew Leicester was among the two worst affected areas in England.The Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”Local public health officials and medics have complained that the government has not supplied sufficiently detailed information on local infections, the lack of which they say hampers attempts to quash new outbreaks.Councils have been promised postcode level data for weeks from Public Health England and the newly created Joint Biosecurity Centre. But some public health directors are concerned the centre has not been sharing data about potential clusters of infections with councils, which could enforce school or workplace closures that could suppress an outbreak at an early stage.“If the only data you’re getting is ‘in this population of 90,000 people there are 40 positives’ it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. If Leicester had got the data sooner they could have had a fighting chance of managing it,” said one public health director, who asked not to be named.The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack a mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground - be they public health teams or local leaders - are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible. This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.”The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has been “working closely with our local partners, providing them with the resources and tools so that they can take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection”.In total, there are 47 English local authorities where there are more than 10 cases per 100,000. In a further sign that the disease has shifted away from the capital, not one of these 47 areas was in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e574c49e8d69db0f7045d6a648b257148a89d8a/0_36_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da94facb0b2583ad69931d6aeb4f3773","title":"highlands community anxious scotland gears up for tourism coronavirus","story":"Influx of potentially infectious visitors worries local people relatively unscathed by coronavirusScotland’s national bard Robert Burns wrote that the Highland welcome was such that he’d ask no more on entering heaven.But with only 114 coronavirus deaths to date, residents of this vast area – which swiftly isolated in March – are equivocal about an influx of visitors as the Scottish tourism sector reopens on 15 July.The homemade “tourists go home” signs that appeared at the start of lockdown to deter isolation tourists may have been removed, but Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, this week acknowledged she could not rule out quarantining or screening travellers from England if infection rates rise south of the border.While tourism bosses warn of threatened cancellations, the  has spoken to residents, businesses and community leaders across the Highlands, whose anxiety and ambivalence is palpable.Joyce Campbell, a hill farmer in Armadale, on the far north coast, has been busy clipping sheep in between the rainstorms this week, but summarises the local mood succinctly: “Safe to say that there’s a lot of mixed emotions on the lifting of lockdown in parts of the Highlands. Many businesses are heavily reliant on tourism income, but really aware of the increased risk that more visitors from outside the area bring to our communities.”Reflecting on an already growing surge of visitors – including a camper van stationed in the car park of the local doctor’s surgery in the remote village of Ballachulish where he lives – Highland councillor Niall McLean is blunt: “This area got off lightly during lockdown, but that makes opening up even more worrying. It was the local communities that kept themselves safe and supported each other, and they don’t want to risk their health, and possibly lives, for economic gain.”With many toilets, car parks and other facilities still closed, tourists will have to step up their efforts to travel respectfully and clear up their own mess, he says. “Local people just want to see visitors who are trying their best.”For those living along the North Coast 500, which is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year, lockdown has provided time to reflect on the impact of the popular touring route, which has also become notorious for camper van jams and straining basic infrastructure.While one of the main appeals of the route was to provide local jobs for young people, many of those working along it were from other, poorer parts of Europe and were sent home by employers at the start of lockdown, to the disappointment of residents who hoped they would work for a season and then stay.An influx of potentially infectious tourists is of significant concern for local medics too. Iain Kennedy, a Highland GP and north of Scotland BMA representative, says practitioners are particularly worried about the situation were a visitor develops symptoms, and how to apply clinical advice from the test, trace, isolate scheme to a tourist who can’t access a swab because they are travelling around, or may not unable to remain in one place because their booking has expired.“Visitors will be very visible to communities, and it’s important that they are aware of that and scrupulous in the way they behave,” Kennedy added. “People in the Highlands are very concerned by what they have seen in Bournemouth and elsewhere, with people behaving as if the virus has gone.”Frazer Coupland, head of Lochaber Chamber of Commerce, has spent the past few days ringing his 220 members based across Fort William, Glencoe and Loch Ness, and is struck by how many of them – while desperate to restart for the obvious economic imperatives – are choosing to wait until August so they can observe the initial impact of opening up on the area.He also suggests that a hefty rise in bookings for outdoor activities providers may indicate a more responsible approach from visitors. “More people are booking organised trips, walking or kayaking, because at this time they don’t want to be that person who calls out mountain rescue.”For Tanja Lister, owner of the Kylesku hotel, which perches on a wild Sutherland peninsula, the sense of responsibility as she reopens to guests – for visitors, her team and the wider community – is “huge”, she says. “It’s a natural reaction for people to be fearful when we haven’t had any new cases locally for weeks, but the alternative is to make 20 people redundant and I’m not prepared to do that without giving it a go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16cbdc3ef1cab58e43f5ff1caf3badd3ad80d381/0_109_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba8cb664b43fa1337b4df0b076dfe9f4","title":"mexico coronavirus doctor lungs scepticism","story":"Dr Iván Cruz wanted to shock people out of pandemic scepticism with X-rays of his coronavirus-scarred lungsThe images of Iván Cruz’s lungs resemble a dust cloud in outer space: light patches enveloped by the gloom.Before he died in hospital, the young Mexican doctor had intended to publish them online to convince the unbelievers: coronavirus exists, and this is what it does to you.“It makes you feel impotent and angry not to be able to grab people and tell them: ‘Don’t you get it?’” said Agileo Cruz, the father of the 28-year-old Mexican doctor, who died from Covid-19-related complications last month.Mexico is now one of the countries worst-hit by Covid-19, with more than 220,000 reported infections and 27,000 dead, the seventh-highest death toll on Earth.In late April, with only 1,351 fatalities, the president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, claimed the pandemic had been “tamed”. But on Saturday Mexico recorded 602 deaths, the highest number anywhere in the world that day.Despite the growing tragedy, some in Mexico continue to doubt the virus’s very existence, taking no precautions and insisting that the epidemic is little but a government invention.In the central state of Puebla a family of traders attacked civil protection officials who asked them to wear masks.In southern Chiapas, residents of one town torched a hospital and beat up doctors in an attempt to halt mosquito fumigation teams they accused of deliberately spreading Covid-19.In Ecatepec, a city near Mexico’s capital, relatives forced their way into a hospital claiming coronavirus did not exist and accusing doctors of killing their loved ones.Mexico’s coronavirus tsar, Hugo López-Gatell, has blamed such behaviour on disinformation. “It strikes me as extraordinary that accurate information is not reaching everyone or that, if this information is reaching them, there are still people who don’t consider Covid a serious epidemic,” the deputy health minister said during one of his nightly television appearances detailing the advance of the illness.But many also point the finger at those in power, including López Obrador, a leftwing populist, who has minimized the threat of Covid-19, has never been seen in a face mask – and on Sunday said he had never taken a coronavirus test, despite the fact that several senior government officials have tested positive.“Who is to blame … when there are world leaders who have played down the impact of this virus from the very beginning?” asked the journalist and commentator José Luis Arévalo.“It’s not just our president … but Donald Trump in the US too, Vladimir Putin in Russia and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil – precisely the countries where the highest number of infections and deaths are being recorded,” Arévalo told ForoTV.“The fact is, the messages of these leaders have been a key factor in leading people to dismiss this disease.”The historian Lorenzo Meyer told Aristegui Noticias he believed coronavirus scepticism in Mexico was partly the consequence of a centuries-old resistance to authorities that stemmed back to colonial times and had intensified in more recent years as a result of abuses committed by the police and armed forces.Cruz’s father said that in Chiapas state, where his son lived and died, many remained doubtful and were doing little to protect themselves. “People only believe in the virus when it affects their family – when they see pictures or names,” he said.His son, who worked in a private clinic in the city of Comitán, knew the dangers all too well but resisted abandoning his job out of devotion to his patients. “He had a gift,” his father remembered. “He loved his profession.”In May, as Covid-19 swept through Latin America, Cruz urged his son to stop working and take shelter in the state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, where the family is from. But the doctor held out until he could go on no more. “The virus has got me,” he admitted to his father one Sunday in late May.X-rays showed that by then Cruz’s lungs had been severely damaged. After testing positive he spent three days at home before being taken to hospital, where he died on 1 June.“I left him at the hospital and I never saw him again,” said his father ,who was later diagnosed with the illness himself and remains in isolation.In one of their last encounters, Cruz’s father remembered his son clutching his radiographs and telling him: “I’m going to post them on Facebook to try and convince those who don’t believe this virus exists.”“He wasn’t able to do this, so I published them for him,” said his father, his breathing ragged and his voice breaking with emotion.In a post on social media, the 53-year-old civil servant and the mother of his son, Maribel Antonio García, said they hoped the images would shock Mexicans into not underestimating the pandemic.“Today we’re asking you, if you’re one of those people who still don’t believe, to inform yourselves … and help to stop the spread of this virus. Covid is aggressive, invasive and it attacks you – physically and mentally,” they wrote.If the images of their son’s lungs told a clear story, the impact on their family was impossible to convey.“We cannot describe to you the pain in the face of our son, because the words don’t exist,” they said, before concluding with a homage to their lost boy.“Rest in peace,” they wrote. “Dr Iván Cruz. Son, brother, grandson, cousin, nephew, friend – but above all a great human being.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

Photograph: iStockIrish holidaymakers continue to have their rights “trampled over” and people are being told to forfeit thousands of euro or “risk their own health and the health of others” by travelling overseas in the weeks ahead, a leading consumer advocate has said.“The reality is consumers have been left in a no-man’s land and have seen their rights trampled over without any consideration for the fact that they paid in advance for trips with all that money now held by airlines and travel companies,” said Dermott Jewell of the Consumers’ Association of Ireland.He said he had been “astounded” when the former Minister for Transport and Tourism Shane Ross “actually went against provisions that consumer groups across the world had taken years to put in place to say that vouchers were the same as refunds”.He said the situation has now “worsened with airlines saying that if their flights are not cancelled people will not get a refund despite the fact that if people take those flights they will be doing so in direct contravention of the advice from the State’s top medical authority.”The new Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, meanwhile, has said people should “restrict travel to when it is absolutely necessary” this summer and urged people to holiday at home in the weeks ahead.“What we are seeing now is an absolute mockery of the rights of people,” Mr Jewell said. He said Irish authorities and officials at an EU level “are doing very little and seem exclusively focused on getting business back in business and giving consumers nothing”.“The last Minister for Transport did very little to help consumers and we really do need to see a very different approach from the Eamon Ryan, the new minister to help citizens who have paid sometimes huge sums which is not at risk.”He said that if the “leading health expert is saying don’t go, then people need to listen to that and if that is the case then something has to give and it can be done either legislatively or simply by the Government telling the public not to travel and telling the travel companies to treat their customers fairly.”Meadbh Hayes is one holidaymaker who faces losing thousands of euro in the weeks ahead. “We booked our trip to Spain for July 28th to August 8th in February,” she said. “As yet, Ryanair have not cancelled our flights and having spent endless time on hold with them, they cannot update me on that flight status.”She said she was “very nervous about travelling with children and concerned about what would happen if we fell ill in Spain? We are stuck in the position where we are being advised by the government not to take non-essential travel and yet risk losing a serious chunk of money.”The situation is arguably more perilous for Keith Lawler.

If a school is behind on the curriculum, it will put students under added pressure,” Mr Laharte said.“Teachers have worked hard to keep education going, there have been inevitable constraints and completing the full curriculum may be too big an ask this year.“The common-sense approach is to give students’ more latitude in the exams on the understanding that everyone will have, for example, 80 per cent of the curriculum covered. That could mean giving students more options in the exam and not making every aspect of the exam compulsory.”Robust examsDeirdre McDonald, Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland (ASTI) president, said next year’s Leaving Cert exams should be tailored by taking into account students’ learning experiences, while ensuring the exams are as robust as ever.“This work needs to be completed well in advance of the commencement of the next school year. It must also be flexible and take into account the conditions, as yet unknown, under which the return to school happens,” she said.The Irish Second Level Students’ Union supported calls for exams to be adapted to ensure students do not have the added pressures of having to catch up on months of missed coursework.Union president Reuban Murray said mental health and career guidance would also be a key challenge for schools and called for funding for guidance counsellor posts to be fully restored.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan Betson The Government will strengthen its warnings about travelling abroad but is unlikely to tell airlines to cancel flights or ban foreign travel, despite warnings from senior public health officials about the dangers of holidaymakers coming here or returning from trips abroad. Senior health officials will brief Ministers on Thursday, and the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 is due to meet on Friday, ahead of a full Cabinet meeting next Monday that will decide whether to ease the 14-day quarantine.Despite officials’ concern about the effects of easing the travel restrictions, there is pressure from airlines and the tourist industry to relax the requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine for 14 days after their arrival in Ireland. Officials are also concerned that the quarantine requirement is not effectively enforced in many cases.It emerged last night that not every passenger arriving into the country is receiving a follow-up call to check that they are self-isolating for 14 days following their arrival into the State.The Department of Justice said that since early last week it has only been in a position to make 60 to 70 per cent of the follow-up calls to passengers arriving into the State to check up on their 14-day quarantine because of the increase in passenger numbers arriving. ‘Large cohort’The department said Covid-19 Passenger Locator Forms, which passengers are required to fill out, are randomly selected and a “large cohort” from every flight but not every passenger is called. Figures released last week show that of the follow-up calls made between May 28th and June 21st more than a third of calls to passengers contacted in follow-up calls went unanswered.The department said that as the passenger numbers increase significantly over the coming days, the task of making the follow-up calls will fall to the HSE as the department’s border management unit “will need to focus exclusively on their core function of immigrating passengers.”Some want the Government to cancel flights, so that people who have booked holidays abroad can be compensated. On Tuesday the Irish Travel Agents Association chief executive Pat Dawson said that giving permission to fly and yet saying not to fly was unfair.Government advice is currently not to travel abroad, but it is expected this will be relaxed after July 9th. Sources said that if people chose to go abroad, they should be aware that the quarantine requirements could change while they are on holidays if the rate of pandemic infections increases.‘Holiday at home’On Tuesday night the new Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin encouraged people to holiday in Ireland. She said that the advice of the chief medical officer “right now . . . is to continue with existing travel restrictions. In the meantime I would encourage people to take this time to holiday at home and enjoy the wonderful natural, cultural and outdoor recreational amenities that our own country has to offer.”Meanwhile, EU member states yesterday approved a list of 15 countries around the world that are deemed safe for travel, agreeing that member states should open their borders to them for all travel from Wednesday.Unusually among EU member states, Ireland is not part of the agreement because it is not in the Schengen area of free travel and has a Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Ireland was invited to take part in the joint agreement, but could only do so if Britain also agreed due to the open Border, and it opted not to do so, The  understands. Denmark is also opting out.The countries deemed safe are: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. China is also to be included, as long as Beijing agrees that EU citizens will also be allowed to travel there in turn.The United States was not included due to pervasive level of coronavirus infections there.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former minister for justice brought proceedings over allegations relating to conduct in officeMother\u0026rsquos words when boy\u0026rsquos body found: \u0026lsquoHe poured a lifetime of love into my life in 14 years\u0026rsquoFormer Sinn F\u0026eacutein leader suing broadcaster over 2016 Spotlight programmeAuthorities unlikely to tell airlines to cancel flights or ban foreign travelPublic sector pay increases to proceed as review warns of \u0026euro25bn hit to public purseClose analysis of cases could help with tracing in potential second wavePublicans will not face criminal sanction if in breach of Covid-19 rulesTeacher unions say greater flexibility and \u0026lsquocommon sense approach\u0026rsquo neededParty leaders yet to finalise list of ministers of State, but there will be disappointmentsThousands of tonnes of bog slipped down Shass mountain near Drumkeeran villageMove will allow 650 students to learn in large socially-distanced settingVideo links and social distancing to be part and parcel of new committeesThe distressed animal was coaxed out of four metres deep Atlantic waters on MondayConcern as people will not get flight refund even if travelling goes against health adviceDespite board refusal, FIE proceeded with case over \u0026euro116 billion Project Ireland planMinister says PPE costs could be as high as \u0026euro1bn while further funds needed for acute bedsT\u0026aacutenaiste sets out the economic challenges facing Ireland in the wake of Covid-19Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bobby storey the ira s planner and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292993.1593549638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"many contenders for junior minister jobs but not enough room in the tent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill could be in line for a quick promotion. She has worked in different government departments as an adviser, is close to Leo Varadkar and is a strong media performer. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireGroups of TDs gathered around Leinster House and the National Convention Centre for nervous conversations about their prospects, conscious that they are all each other’s rivals as much as colleagues.The subject of their speculations was Wednesday’s expected announcement of the list of ministers of State – junior ministers – and their chances of inclusion in the second tier of ministerial office.The aspirant junior ministers may have to wait a little longer after the three party leaders failed to conclude a final list at a meeting on Tuesday night. They are due to confer on Wednesday, and an incorporeal Cabinet meeting may be held later on Wednesday to make the appointments. The list may not now be made public until Thursday, Government sources said on Tuesday night.Politicians are obsessed with jobs for politicians it is part of what makes them tick. And even though the public don’t care that much one way or the other, the allocation and distribution of jobs is important for any government. The first few days of the new Government have been overshadowed by the controversy over Dara Calleary’s appointment, or non-appointment. This may be a vast overstatement of its true importance but it is real, nonetheless. So the three party leaders will be very careful about these appointments. That is good news for those whose gender and geography is an advantage.Tight squeezeIt’s a tight squeeze for Fine Gael, whose leader, Leo Varadkar, must contend with the expectations of some of the demoted Cabinet ministers. Of these, Josepha Madigan is considered a “cert” for promotion while former education minister Joe McHugh is also tipped. Like his fellow former Cabinet minister Michael Ring in Mayo, McHugh, a Donegal TD, has geography on his side.So do outgoing junior ministers John Paul Phelan (the southeast) and Patrick O’Donovan (midwest). Their colleagues Damien English and Brendan Griffin have been strong performers but things are filling up now, and there is only one woman so far – so new TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill could be in line for a quick promotion. She has worked in different government departments as an adviser, is close to Varadkar and is a strong media performer. Other possible promotions are party chairman Martin Hayden. But they can’t all get in.Micheál Martin will use the appointments in a bid to ease some of the anger in his parliamentary party, but will be conscious of the first rule of ministerial appointments: you end up making more enemies than friends. Those who are appointed tend to believe they get there on merit those left out can nurse grudges for years.UnluckyMeath TD Thomas Byrne was unlucky not to make Cabinet and is in line for Helen McEntee’s old job as junior minister for Europe, sources say. Anne Rabbitte was widely tipped for Cabinet and left disappointed, so will feel truly victimised if she is omitted. Mary Butler (Waterford) has the advantages of both gender and geography. Jack Chambers is considered a short-odds bet, while Robert Troy and Charlie McConalogue have strong claims and are likely to be included. Michael Moynihan, Marc McSharry and James Lawless are also in the running but we are running out of slots here.And what of Jim O’Callaghan? The party’s justice spokesman was very publicly snubbed by his leader. Colleagues wonder if he would take a junior gig, though he has indicated to some he would be interested. Limerick deputy Niall Collins was slapped down after a Dáil voting controversy, but he is able and experienced. Whatever Martin does, he will only succeed in annoying more people.The Greens have three jobs and eight contenders. Brian Leddin, Malcolm Noonan and Marc Ó Cathasaigh are all in a strong position, but perhaps the biggest question will be whether Eamon Ryan appoints Neasa Hourigan – formerly the party’s finance spokeswoman but a strong opponent of the coalition deal – to a job in that coalition.Inside the tent, or outside? With 20 junior ministers, it’s a big tent. But there’s never room for everyone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293006.1593552694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord empty theatre eeriness as cabinet takes their seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar: Admits it is “very unusual” not to have a senior minister from the west. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIn his first Dáil appearance as Heather Humphreys’s replacement, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar confirmed what many were thinking about the botched delivery of Cabinet jobs west of the Shannon – it was a case of cock-up rather than conspiracy.With Taoiseach Micheál Martin back at base busy working himself into his new brief, his predecessor remained in the spotlight on Tuesday, opening for the Government at the start of a day-long Dáil debate on spending. It wasn’t long before Leo let the cat out of the bag about Saturday night’s Cromwellian damnation of the entire west of Ireland by their new political overlords.It seems the parties in the tripartite government simply couldn’t get their act together, which bodes well for the future.Sinn Féin’s Claire Kerrane told the freshly minted Minister for Enterprise and Trade that the non-appointment of a senior representative from the region for the first time in the history of the State was a “huge mistake” and the electorate would not forget it. The TD for Roscommon-Galway doesn’t doubt they will try to “overcompensate” by appointing a clatter of westerners as Ministers of State, but “the damage is done”.The Tánaiste tried to explain what happened, while making sure to point out that such an omission never happened when he was in charge of appointing his own cabinet. “But I think when you have three parties doing it, and perhaps not co-ordinating it, you turn up with unusual results.”Such as fury from Falcarragh to Foynes and a miffed political martyr in Mayo.If a camel is a horse designed by committee, then the cabinet Micheál, Leo and Eamon built is the Merrion Street equivalent and it’s given a lot of people the hump.But they are anxious to make amends. Varadkar admitted “it is very unusual” not to have a senior minister in Connacht and promised they would do better in the next round of appointments.Ruffled feathersIt would be interesting to know when the penny dropped and the Big Three realised they made a complete dog’s dinner of their historic cabinet, the one which officially ended Civil War politics by pitting one half of the country against the other.As part of the Government’s rearguard action to smooth ruffled feathers in the west, the Tánaiste offered comforting words. After all “We DO have Hildegarde Naughten and Dara Calleary there” he cooed, referring to the two “super junior” ministers from Galway and Mayo.Contrary to popular belief, they are full members of cabinet. Oh yes. They are full members of cabinet even if they are not members of cabinet in the constitutional sense.It doesn’t matter that they have no vote either because the Cabinet hasn’t voted on anything for the guts of 40 years.“So their weight and voice will be equal to those of any other member of the Cabinet and I want people to know that.”And in the meantime, before it’s properly decent to have a reshuffle, here’s a rake of Ministers of State to be getting on with . . .If the Dáil had been sitting in Leinster House instead of the Convention Centre in Dublin’s docklands, there might have been angry scenes and heated exchanges about the 33rd government’s inaugural clanger, but the temporary venue is a political passion killer.Even if all 160 TDs were present – most of them high-tailed it back to the cosier confines of Leinster House when not required for speaking purposes – they would have been rattling around in a 2,000-seater auditorium. There is an empty-theatre eeriness about the proceedings.The Ceann Comhairle does his best to spot speakers from behind his drab desk in the middle of the stage. He couldn’t see Leo Varadkar when it was time to begin, scanning the empty rows stretching before him.“Is the Tánaiste here?”Ushers’ torchesA door opened halfway down and Leo beetled in with his new haircut. He was escorted to his place by two ushers, one of whom held a seating map. It might be a good idea to give the ushers torches, then they could shine them on the seats to help TDs find their socially distanced designated berths, then sell them popcorn.There were a few frontbench colleagues scattered around in Leo’s general vicinity. Heather Humphreys (social protection, community and rural developments and the islands) was in the same row as Norma Foley (education), although they were well apart.When Norma arrived, Heather had to move out for her to shuffle past. All that was missing was a chorus of “sorry, sorry, sorry, beg your pardon, sorry, sorry, oops, sorry . . .” as she felt her way along the row.It’s only a matter of time before TDs start opening bags of crisps and rustling sweet wrappers during Leaders’ Questions. The pop-up seats are fancier than the ones in the Dáil. They are described frighteningly as “premium Figueras ‘eight-hour’ chairs”.There won’t be any need for that.Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins rose to speak on the revised budget questions but the Ceann Comhairle stopped him as soon as he started.“Sorry, am I sharing?” Collins asked, unaware that a party colleague was speaking in the same slot.“Deputy Troy is gesticulating furiously from the gallery” explained the chair, motioning towards the balcony where stood the TD for Longford Westmeath, like he was auditioning for Romeo and Juliet.Dress circleCollins couldn’t see him, as he was below in the stalls.“Where is he?” snapped Niall impatiently, looking around. But he couldn’t glimpse his colleague waving an order paper to gain attention and tipping dangerously towards the edge of the dress circle.“Don’t fall over there Deputy Troy. Please,” cried Seán Ó Fearghaíl with exquisite hamminess.Now Robert appeared to be trying out for Riverdance.“We spot you. Don’t worry,” boomed the Ceann Comhairle, just as we feared the deputy might plunge into the parterre with no musicians in the orchestra pit to do him justice.“So I have to share, I presume, yeah?” said Limerick County’s Collins to the vast swathe of empty seats around him while Troy, out of eyeshot, subsided into his premium Figueras, exhausted.Niall sounded disappointed, to add to his disappointment over not getting a senior job on Saturday. Probably a rap on the knuckles for his involvement in Fianna Fáil’s Votegate, War of the Buttons embarrassment. Still, at least he’s not in the Seanad, like his partner in crime, Timmy Dooley.“It’s quite hard to make yourself seen when you’re so far away” murmured Robert from the balcony when he finally got to speak. Richard Boyd Barrett, on the other hand. You can tell that the People Before Profit comes from a family of theatrical greats. He has no problem projecting in the Convention Centre auditorium.The same might have been said of Mary Lou McDonald, who is similarly vocally accomplished, but she was in Belfast at the funeral of ex-IRA chief Bobby Storey, marching along in the thick of a Covid-19 regulation-defying cortege.She’s had the virus, unlike her Sinn Féin colleagues who travelled from Dublin with her.It’s a pity they couldn’t find any masks all the same."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second wavePolice tweet picture of man arrested for carrying a Hong Kong independence flagHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293519.1593603603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"from renditions to closed door trials what china s security law means for hong kong","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProtesters hold flags that read ‘Hong Kong Independence’ during a protest in Causeway Bay district, in Hong Kong. Photograph: Roy LiuBloombergLeading Hong Kong lawyers are warning of a stark new era of mainland justice as they digest the full impact of China’s new national security law imposed directly by Communist Party leaders in Beijing. The possibility of Chinese agents whisking suspects to the mainland for trial and prison – a prospect effectively blocked last year amid large-scale protests against an extradition plan – is one of several changes that is alarming some in the legal, business and diplomatic communities.The previously secret law for Hong Kong took immediate effect when it was published at 11pm (1500 GMT) on Tuesday, leaving many to scramble overnight to understand its full sweep across China’s freest city. Nearly 200 protesters, defying the new legislation, were arrested on Wednesday.Hong Kong’s proudly independent judiciary, one of many freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule exactly 23 years ago, has long been considered key to its success as a global financial hub.The new law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, heralding a more authoritarian future.Both Hong Kong and Chinese government officials have said the law is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the city over the last year.Significantly, the law allows Beijing to create a new national security agency in the city able to take enforcement action beyond existing Hong Kong laws in the most serious cases.It even specifies that local authorities cannot inspect agents’ vehicles.The mainland agents will have the ability to enforce mainland laws and take suspects across the border for trial, potentially eroding the strength of Hong Kong’s common law traditions.Both Asian and Western envoys are watching developments closely, fearing their own nationals in the city could now be at greater risk, particularly as tensions spike between Beijing and Western governments over trade, human rights and the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.‘Devils in the details’The prospect of formalised renditions is evoking memories of the disappearance of a mainland tycoon from a hotel in the city as well others from Hong Kong in recent years, including a bookseller who said he had been abducted by mainland agents and is now in Taiwan. Under the new law, Hong Kong will also have its own national security agency, that will supervise a special local police unit with extra powers of search, electronic surveillance and asset seizure.“In that single article alone, they are reversing years of safeguards of human rights that have been built up by case law,” said Simon Young, a professor at the University of Hong Kong’s law school.“The less we disturb this law by coming within its radar, the better,” he added, noting that even if Hong Kong’s courts applied the law according to common law principles, they could be overruled by China’s parliament.Zhang Xiaoming, deputy chief of Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the mainland agency would abide by Chinese law and that Hong Kong’s legal system could not be expected to implement mainland laws.Other lawyers described “the ground shifting beneath our feet”, saying it was unclear how the laws, drafted in Beijing, could be aligned with Hong Kong’s human rights protections.The laws, for example, make several references to “state secrets”, linking their theft to the crime of colluding with foreign governments as well as providing for court cases behind closed doors and without juries.While it grants the city’s leader the power to certify to a court that something is a secret, much greater clarity is needed, lawyers and diplomats said.One senior Hong Kong barrister urged the Hong Kong government to clarify the many grey areas.“Whoever drafted it was not apparently cognisant of common law principles, so it is proving very hard to fully grasp at this point,” the barrister said.“There are likely to be all kinds of devils in the details.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292699.1593546508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are france and germany advising against travel to ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Aer Lingus planes lined up at Dublin Airport. Photograph: Alan Betson Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark are among the European Union member states that advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.It’s rare for such countries to advise against travel to a fellow EU member state, since an agreement in Brussels that most countries in the bloc would open their borders to one another on June 15th.Why is Ireland left out? It’s due to its unusual position in the EU rather than our rate of coronavirus infections.Ireland is not in the Schengen area of free travel, unlike most EU member states. Instead, we have a Common Travel Area with Britain that is decades older.Now that the United Kingdom is no longer an EU member state and is choosing not to collaborate even on many things it is still invited to take part in, this puts Ireland in an awkward position.Because of the open border with the North, it has little choice but to follow the lead of the UK.When the Schengen states agreed to close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland and the UK went their own way. They kept their borders open, and ultimately introduced a requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine at home for two weeks after arriving.It’s this quarantine requirement that many EU states cite as the reason for advising their citizens against travel to Ireland. Nevertheless, their borders are open to travellers coming in the other direction, arriving from Ireland.“This is an advice from our side against travelling which is due to the fact that Ireland, and also Britain, have quarantine requirements that are in place for German citizens when they enter the country,” a German government spokesman said.“It doesn’t affect at all the status of Irish citizens or people travelling from Ireland.”This has led to the unusual situation that it may be easier to travel between countries like Germany and some of the non-EU states on the list – such as Rwanda, Tunisia and Uruguay – than with Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Plan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293023.1593558854!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fda issues guidance for coronavirus vaccine approval","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says a vaccine is still some time away. Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday released guidance for approving a coronavirus vaccine, saying the vaccine has to prevent or decrease disease severity in at least 50 per cent of people who are inoculated.More than 100 vaccines are being tested worldwide against the virus, which has claimed more 126,100 lives in the United States.In May, the Trump administration announced a program called “Operation Warp Speed” to speed up the development of Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines, as the country has none approved for treating the virus.Several companies such as Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are in the race to develop a vaccine.“While the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in our decisions,” the FDA said.Experts have said it could take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to be developed.Vaccine developers have also been asked for data to support use during pregnancy and to show safety and effectiveness in children, the health regulator said.“The guidelines are pretty standard, they look pretty much like influenza vaccine guidelines,” said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo vaccine research group. “I don’t think that’s a high bar. I think that’s a low to maybe an appropriate bar for a first-generation Covid-19 vaccine.”Flu vaccines are 30 -70 per cent effective in any given year, according to Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. The guidelines could be seen as a relatively high bar given the urgency to accelerate availability of a vaccine, Yee added.Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States government’s top infectious diseases expert, cautioned that there is no guarantee of a safe and effective vaccine. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

To the extent possible, we want to ensure that any American patient who needs remdesivir can get it.The Trump Administration is doing everything in our power to learn more about life-saving therapeutics for Covid-19 and secure access to these options for the American people.”Gilead has priced remdesivir at $2,340 per patient for wealthier nations.The price tag is slightly below the range of $2,520 to $2,800 suggested last week by US drug pricing research group the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER).Remdesivir is expected to be in high demand as one of the only treatments so far shown to alter the course of the virus.After the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial, it won emergency use authorisation in the United States and full approval in Japan.The company is developing an inhaled version that could be used outside a hospital setting.Remdesivir had previously failed as an Ebola treatment and has not shown that it can reduce coronavirus deaths.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up come dine prague","story":"Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the end of the Czech Republic’s coronavirus crisis on Prague’s glorious Charles Bridge on Tuesday. Back at home, a lot of us have been donning running shoes and getting fitter in lockdown too.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

Ministers have faced criticism for the handling of the surge in cases in Leicester, which was put into the UK’s first local lockdown on Tuesday. Australian authorities, meanwhile, will lock down about 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for one month from today after two weeks of double-digit rises in new Covid-19 cases.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore UK cities and towns being monitored for fresh virus spikesPM \u0027blind to risks\u0027 of lifting lockdown, says StarmerGovernment urged to extend furlough scheme \u0027to save millions of jobs\u0027Leading doctors say local authorities must be given better Covid-19 dataAustralia locks down 300,000 in Melbourne to contain outbreakPM \u0027blind to the risks\u0027 of easing lockdown, says StarmerKeir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of being blind to the risks of easing the coronavirus lockdown this weekend.Speaking during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, he noted the latest round of restrictions were being lifted without an app, without clear data for local authorities or the world-beating system we were promised.He added: I support the easing of restrictions but unlike the prime minister, I\u0027m not blind to the risks and I don\u0027t think anybody else should be.Starmer said: Of the 22,000 new cases of Covid infections per week in mid June, just 5,000 were reached and asked to provide details. So now three quarters of people with Covid-19 are not being reached. How does the prime minister explain that?Johnson replied: As he knows very well the test, track and trace operation is actually reaching huge numbers of people and causing them to self-isolate in ways I don\u0027t think he conceivably could have expected a month ago when this system was set up.The PM\u0026nbspadded that the test and trace system has now reached 113,000 contacts, 113,000 contacts who have undertaken to self-isolate to stop the disease spreading.Starmer says government must extend furlough scheme for workers at risk of losing jobsKeir Starmer\u0026nbsphas urged the government to extend the coronavirus\u0026nbspfurlough scheme\u0026nbspfor workers most at risk of redundancy.The Labour leader warned next week\u0027s financial statement\u0026nbspcould be the last chance to save millions of jobs.Rob Merrick has the story:Turkish president claims EU\u0027s restrictive treatment of Turkey is \u0027political\u0027Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan has claimed the European Union had treated Turkey in a restrictive way over the coronavirus pandemic in what he said was a political stance.He did not provide further details but his comments came after the EU excluded Turkey, along with the United States and other countries, from its initial safe list of countries from which the bloc will allow non-essential travel from Wednesday.The president was giving a speech to officials from his AK Party.Philippines reports 999 new cases, including four deathsThe Philippines\u0027 health ministry has reported 999 more coronavirus infections and four additional deaths.In a bulletin, the ministry said total confirmed cases have reached 38,511 while deaths have increased to 1,270.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday retained partial restrictions in the capital Manila for another two weeks to contain the spread of the virus while reducing the pandemic\u0027s economic damage.Thailand reopens schools, pubs and massage parloursThailand has begun a fifth phase of relaxations of Covid-19 restrictions, allowing the reopening of schools and high-risk entertainment venues such as pubs and massage parlours that had been shut since mid-March.It is also allowing in foreign visitors on a controlled basis, limiting entry to those with existing family or work ties to the country, students, technical experts for businesses, investors and specially invited VIPs. Scheduled passenger flights to Thailand were suspended in early April.The number of foreign visitors allowed into the country each day is limited to 200, and they are supposed to travel on repatriation flights bringing Thai citizens home. All returnees, foreign and Thai, will be subject to varying degrees of quarantine.All confirmed coronavirus cases for the past five weeks have been repatriated Thais rather than cases of local transmission, giving the government confidence to lift restrictions. However, it has extended through July a state of emergency, though critics claim it is being\u0026nbspused to suppress political dissent.Reopened establishments still have to maintain social distancing rules. A contact tracing app already used at shopping malls is also mandated for the reopened entertainment venues, including soapy massage parlors, which are often illegal fronts for sexual services.South Korea to start talks on Covid-19 drug remdesivir purchases in AugustSouth Korea has started distributing stocks of the Covid-19 treatment remdesivir that have been donated by Gilead Sciences Inc and plans to begin talks to purchase more supplies in August, its disease control agency said.It is the first country to disclose a timeline for talks with Gilead. The drugmaker said this week it has priced remdesivir at $390 per vial in developed countries and agreed to allocate nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months.One of the few treatments shown to alter the course of Covid-19, remdesivir is expected to be in high demand. The intravenously administered medicine has won emergency-use authorisation in several countries and full approval in Japan after a clinical trial showed it helped shorten hospital stays.Only patients severely ill with Covid-19 are eligible for remdesivir and South Korea currently has 33 such patients, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I didn’t think at the time.”Insisting that Disney was “the most progressive group of people I’ve ever worked with”, Ortega continued: “I was concerned because it was family and kids, that Disney might not be ready to cross that line and move into that territory yet.Oumou Sangaré: ‘I think this pandemic has brought us together’Burping and belching babes: How Ladette to Lady defined an era“So, I just took it upon myself to make choices that I felt that those who were watching would grab.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We have been on it.”The emergency crackdown in Leicester follows the revelation that one in 10 new infections nationwide are happening in the cityNon-essential shops will shut and remain closed for the foreseeable future, most schools will be closed from Thursday and plans to relax shielding measures for the most vulnerable have been shelved.With the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants no longer permitted to reopen this weekend, there are fears of people flocking to nearby Derby and Nottingham, for example.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Cities and towns including Bradford, Barnsley and Oldham as well as parts of London are being monitored closely amid fears that Leicester-style flare-ups of coronavirus could emerge elsewhere in the country.But officials believe that the outbreak on Leicester remains on a different scale from other sites where mini-spikes have emerged in recent weeks, and no further city-wide lockdowns are expected within the coming days, official sources told The Independent.All eyes are on the virus’s response to the ‘super Saturday’ relaxation of lockdown restrictions on 4 July, when pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be among thousands of businesses reopening after more than 100 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrime minister Boris Johnson has said he will not hesitate to reimpose localised controls should testing reveal new pockets of infection following the weekend.The decision to exempt Leicester from Saturday’s rollback of lockdown was taken after infection rates reached 135 per 100,000 population in the East Midlands city, with signs that the virus had broken out of inidual workplaces and institutions and was spreading within households.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe city’s infection rate remains more than three times the next biggest hotspot, Bradford, at around 40 per 100,000.

But the source said that as things stand no active preparations are understood to be being made for Leicester-style city-wide lockdowns in the coming days.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut EU employers are anticipating the end of those right, which will make it harder for Britons to do some jobs that involve cross-border travel.“We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU,” Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee.UK policies risk ‘retaliatory deportations’ for Brits living in EUWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We’re not even at the end of transition yet and there are already real live instances of people’s lives and livelihoods being affected – and that will only increase. So many jobs rely on free movement because of the single market.”Ms Meadows added: “We have a very large number of people whose livelihood is based on working in different countries – people with small businesses, people who are employed, and an awful lot of them face losing our livelihoods. It’s not just about losing your rights on paper, it’s something that affects real lives.”While the Brexit withdrawal agreement protects some of the rights of British citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK, there are holes in it, notably with regard to jobs not based in a single member state. The integrated nature of EU economies means that occasional travel to other countries is common, particularly in professional-level occupations.There are also gaps in the extent to which Britons’ qualifications will be mutually recognised in the EU after Brexit.Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: “There’s a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain – there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won’t be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this – to go and study and work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no rights in the withdrawal agreement on cross-border working,” she said.Britain and the EU are currently negotiating a future relationship, which both sides have always said will cover immigration issues.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Prague has celebrated a self-proclaimed end to its coronavirus epidemic – by throwing a massive party attended by thousands of people all sharing food and without any social distancing.The Czech capital held the unorthodox gathering to say a “symbolic farewell” to the infection and to show residents should no longer be scared to meet with friends or visit local businesses.A 500 metre table was set up on the famous Charles Bridge with people packed along it swapping snacks and drinks brought from home.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDancing and singing were enjoyed as local musicians played in the open streets.The event was held despite some 260 new Covid-19 cases being found in the country last week. Fears that such an event could become a super-spreader if just a few undiagnosed sufferers turned up were apparently dismissed.Ondrej Kobza, organiser and owner of a cafe in the city, said: “We want to celebrate the end of the coronavirus crisis by letting people meet and show they are not afraid to meet, that they are not afraid to take a piece of a sandwich from their neighbour.”If the prudence of such a mass event may seem questionable to Brits currently living under the shadow of almost 50,000 deaths and a government still demonstrably failing to get a grip on the crisis here, it may be that Czechs have greater confidence in their own handling of the situation.There have, so far, been fewer than 12,000 infections in the central European country and just 350 deaths after leaders enforced a lockdown that was implemented hard and early.The new party came a month after restaurants, bars and pubs had been allowed to reopen and a week on since the government permitted public gatherings of up to 1,000 people again.One attendee, Galina Khomchenko-Krejcikova, said she found out about the party on Facebook and decided to go along.“I just finished a night shift so I didn’t have time to prepare anything,” she said. “But we brought some wine and snacks we found at home.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair.

Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”“We know what happened next,# he says.“Thats why there needs to be a laser-like focus on protecting jobs.”Mr Johnson says Sir Keir should pay tribute to the Government for protecting million jobs with the furlough scheme and says he wont put a figure on the jobs that could be lost.“Thats why were proceeding with the New Deal, the fair deal for British people,” he argues.“We are going to build, build, build and provide jobs, jobs, jobs.”Boris Johnson is facing off against Sir Keir Starmer for PMQs this afternoon.Sir Keir says the local authorities in Leicester, where the lockdown has been extended, had just half of the information they needed – and didnt even know the real figure of people affected until last week.“The local authority thought there were  positive tests in the last fortnight, when the real figure was ,” he says, adding that theres been a “lost week when the virus was spreading”.Mr Johnson hits back – he says the Government shares its data with all local authorities across the country.However, in defending the whack-a-mole strategy, he does acknowledge there were issues in Leicester.“There were particular problems in implementing the advice and getting people to understand what was necessary to do,” Mr Johnson says.Following on from that last blog post, we thought wed revisit a story from April about the UKs drive to get enough PPE.At that time, Brussels insisted the British Government was given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme to bulk buy medical equipment.Officials said officials from the UK apparently missed a series of key meetings on it.And they said the plan to pool procurement of key kit including ventilators and PPE had been a “recurring topic” at virtual meetings British officials attended.Heres that story.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says the UK missed out on the chance to take part in European Union procurement schemes for PPE because the information was sent to an outdated email address.He suggested Brussels officials were to blame for not updating their contact details.In a letter to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, he said: “The relevant EU committee, the Joint Procurement Agreement Steering Committee , was relaunched by the European Commission in September , after three years of not meeting.“The UK provided up-to-date contact details for the UK representatives to the JPASC in September .“Despite this, however, we understand from the commission that the UK contact details on their circulation list… were still those of the previous UK representatives – ie those who had last attended JPSAC in .”Image: GettyBrexit talks resumed this week # and the German chancellor is hopeful for a dealthe UK takes a more realistic approach.Angela Merkel said she believes she can #moderate# between the two sides to get a deal # but only#the UK needs to take a more realistic approach#.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The surplus skin on Aryas arms in particular has left him embarrassed and he tries to hide it with long shirtsleeves. He weighed lbsat his heaviest, at the age of , and struggled to do simple activities like walk down the road to school or even take a bath.Arya was once so obese he was unable to move from his bed, let alone play with his friends.The lad baffled doctors nearly five years ago when footage of him playing in a water tank to cool his body emerged from the small village of Cipurwasari in Indonesias West Java province.And his parents Rokayah Somantri, , and Ade Somantri, , were left in despair as he was missing out on school because it was impossible for him to get there.So, he underwent a gastric bypass to help start losing weight.Arya also followed a stricter diet and undertook rigorous exercise - at one stage walking three miles every day and playing badminton with his pals.The teen has become a regular gymgoer, where hes been trained by Indonesian bodybuilder Ade Rai and a team of health professionals.He told Tribun News that Arya had changed his eating habits as he used to enjoy sweet drinks, and tucked into instant processed foods - wolfing down two plates of meatballs in one sitting.Rai said the boy was a success story because of Aryas own and his familys behaviour patterns and the medical support that Arya has received so far.He explained his role was to motivate the boy take better care of himself, and reduce weight in a healthy way to stop him from developing a chronic disease or dying a premature death.Hopefully the Arya Permana story can be a valuable lesson for us all.And I hope that children in Indonesia have parents and families who are able to positively influence them so they are willing to imitate healthy behaviour, he added.Video of him in the gym has racked up about , views on Rai’s Instagram.Alexander Gomes joined scores of viewers to praise the lad, commenting: Good job sir!Others applauded his willpower, especially as he is still to undergo more surgery to remove excess skin after shedding kg.Despite the obvious health benefits, the teen is still struggling with his surplus skin and is keen to undergo more operations to make him feel more comfortable.Its also meant that when he has participated in sports the excess skin rubs and irritates him.

Thats a line straight from the Dominic Cummings playbook. And by the way, unlike everyone  in the media, I mean that as a positive thing.A £ billion post-Covid cash injection will add to the £ billion already granted to the NHS, £ billion to education and, of course, £ billion to infrastructureWhile these plans were broadly spelt out in the Tory election manesto, theyre being sped up thanks to the coronavirus crisis which has seen the economy on a clf edge but provided the ability to borrow big with low interest rates.Thats why the PM is right when he said: We must use this moment now - this interval - to plan our response.There was the right degree of humility regarding certain aspects of the corona response, with an admittance that parts of government had responded so sluggishly it was like a recurring bad dream.There was also a brief nod to his predecessors like David Cameron and George Osbourne.

It’s like we’re going back to March. “Closing schools, closing shops again. It’s scary, it just shows how a second wave can be not far off.”Jacob Donald, , a mechanical engineering student at De Montfort University, said he was not surprised at the lockdown as people had been acting as“it’s normal times again”.He said: “People have stopped following the guidelines and there’s little social distancing. We’ve been hearing more parties recently in gardens.”In contrast to the city centre, local supermarkets were busy yesterday as hundreds of people rushed to load up with essentials.As staff struggled to keep shelves stocked, shopper Jaqruei Laiseta, , said: “Last time, I couldn’t get anything — no pasta, no milk, no flour. It was really worrying.“I can’t afford to stockpile loads because I’m on benefits, but I’m terried we will be left with nothing again.

My friend spoke to me this morning and said she can’t get any loo rolls.”Health Secretary \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Matt Hancock placed Leicester back into lockdown after other measures failed to contain the outbreak.Officials had recently ramped up testing for residents and spent  days working with factories that experienced spikes. A government source said: “The garment and textile factories in Leicester have been a particular problem.

The focus at the moment is public health.”Legal food and clothing factories have also been hit by the bug, with workers unwittingly taking the virus home to their children.Andrew Bridgen, Tory MP for North West Leicestershire, said a “perfect storm” of factors contributed to the outbreak.He added: “We have the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown.“On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry.“And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which my sources are telling me has worked for busy internet retailers throughout lockdown.”Dr Bharat Pankhania, from University of Exeter Medical School, said: “Sweatshop conditions are a nightmare for infection control and a breeding ground for the likes of coronavirus.“You have lots of people crammed into a tight space, with poor ventilation and a noisy environment.“If they are allowed to speak, they will have to talk loudly over the sound of machines, which sprays droplets further.

It wasn’t that long ago we were heading to Costa clutching our reusable coffee cups with pride and packing our groceries into our “bags for le”.We were horried when David Attenborough showed us footage of a turtle tangled up in plastic that had found its way into the ocean.We dutully sorted our trash into recycling bins and shunned plastic straws.Now it is like a boil has burst. People have been repressed for so long during lockdown that, now they are free to go out again, they have forgotten how to behave.They see others leave their rubbish and think it is OK to do it too. It is classic copycat behaviour. If a place looks like a dump, people start treating it like that.When daytrippers are drinking or getting high on “laughing gas”, they are likely to lose their inhibitions. They become irresponsible and unashamed of urinating in the street.If you can’t find a bin or they are all overflowing, take your rubbish home with you. It’s not dficult.In fact, take two carrier bags out with you — one for your litter and oneyou really can’t find a toilet.Butit comes to that, please hide yourself away. It is so undignied to think of people defecating in public places such as the grounds of the Queen’s Balmoral estate, as The Sun reported on Monday. For goodness’ sake! A lot of public loos aren’t open — and that is something councils need to really look at. No one wants to see our countryside turned into a toilet.It is great we can now meet up with others for a few drinks in the outdoors and take the family to the beach. But we really must look at ourselves.The police have better things to do than tell grown men and women to bin their McDonald’s boxes. Now is the time to take some personal responsibility.It is interesting that people in Wales and Scotland are still restricted to travelling just five miles from their homes. If people in England can’t respect our outdoors, perhaps we should apply that across the whole UK.Then the only people allowed on our glorious beaches would be locals who care for the area. Another idea might be to place refuse trucks nearby, with bins for general waste and recycling containers. That way there would be no excuse not to dispose of your rubbish properly.In Spain’s Benidorm, sun worshippers have to use an online booking system to secure their spot on the sand. That keeps the numbers at an acceptable level.We have the Keep It, Bin It campaign — a joint message from the Government and Keep Britain Tidy. But at the moment it seems to be falling on deaf ears. We need to be tough.Clearly, putting up signs saying “Beauty dies where litter lies” is not doing the job. We need bigger fines to act as a real deterrent.Alternatively, we could follow the example of Calornia, in the US, where they impose community service on louts who leave their rubbish behind.When I was in Los Angeles I saw people in unorm cleaning the beaches.In that city, a third littering offence results in  hours of collecting rubbish.Such community service could be a humbling experience that would help people realise how unpleasant it is to tidy up someone ’s mess.Sadly, it seems we need to be reminded about wildle and seale getting choked by plastic.Perhaps we need to see some stark images on Instagram, TikTok and all the other social media young people use. Not that young people are solely at fault. Unfortunately, many of those to blame are old enough to know better.It seems our morals have gone out of the window along with social distancing. The messaging from the Government has been all over the place.Better enforcement of social distancing — as we saw in the early days of lockdown — would mean fewer people congregating in public areas and less litter.People in England have been told it is OK to go to the beach, meet other people and enjoy themselves . . . and they have gone mad. In Wales and Scotland, the messaging has been very clear.One piece of good news is that the weather is going to be rubbish this weekend, when the pubs and restaurants reopen.Perhaps that will limit the numbers heading to our beaches and parks, giving us all some extra time to think about how we behave.We have come through lockdown but we need to emerge in positive fashion, thinking about each other — and our country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: We’re waiting asbetween the flash of lightning and the thunderclap with our hearts in our mouths for the full economic reverberations to appear.The PM declined to estimate how many jobs could be lost but warned that the post-pandemic crisis would be worse than the  financial crash. Mr Haldanes comments come after the Bank recently said it now expects gross domestic product to tumble by  per cent in the first half of the year.This is a record, but not quite as extreme as the  per cent it predicted in May.But Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, warned at the time against getting carried away by signs the recession may not have been quite as steep as it expected, with the Bank launching another £ billion of quantitative easingto help boost the economy.Mr Haldane was the only one on the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee to vote against increasing QE in the June meeting.In his speech, he saidthe economy continues recovering on a similar path as lockdown measures ease further, then the loss in annual GDP could be far lower than first feared, at  per cent against  per cent forecast in May.But he cautioned some of this may be down to pent-up demand, as well as the massive Government support for households and businesses through the scheme to furlough workers on  per cent pay.With nine million workers currently on furlough, he said there was a risk of soaring unemployment when the Government support measures end, which could impact the path of recovery.Mr Haldane said he remained open-minded about more action to boost the economy.His prediction of a V-shaped rebound was supported by separate data compiled by Barclays.

The -year-old told StokeSentinel: “Theres a big problem with rats, some people have even had them in their yard.“Its the fly-tipping that attracts the vermin. You get morons who dont give a damn who just sling their rubbish into an alley and then foxes rip the bags open. Its not what you want.”Mike Flynn, from Alpha Pest Control, said he believes rats have adapted their behaviour to survive as they scrabble for food while restaurants remain shut.He said: “There has definitely been a change in behaviour with the rats over lockdown.“Previously people would throw their takeaway cartons on the road or in car parks but now people are at home more.“The rats are getting more brazen and desperate so are heading into people’s houses.“There’s also been a rise in cannibalistic rats. I had caught one in a trap the other day and when we went back to it was just the bare bones. Another rat had feasted on it.”He added: “They will usually come in through the bathroom or kitchen.“They are often seen in toilets. A telltale sign isit looks like someone has poured dirty mop water down the loo.“They can live around us quite happily.”BPCA technical officer Natalie Bungay said: “With less footfall across cities and towns there is less associated food waste being left in bins and on the floor.“As a result, rat populations are likely to move further afield to satisfy their need for a food source and this, in turn, is likely to cause more sightings.“In terms of rats in domestic homes, so long as you manage your food waste properly and there are no considerable harbourage opportunities, you shouldn’t experience any unusual problems.“The risk may be thatyou find you are doing more gardening and creating more garden waste, the storage of this in piles around your garden can provide a perfect place for rats to live and breed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

you’re there for a friendly chat, not an interview.CHAT ABOUT THE PASTAsk about the past and what le was like growing up instead of talking about the current situation - it’ll lead to better conversations.TAKE YOUR TIMEIf the person you are chatting to is struggling to hear you clearly, try speaking more slowly rather than upping the volume.THAT AWKWARD SILENCEDon’t worry about long pauses in conversation - it gives everyone time to gather their thoughts. Instead,  per cent of those suffering with loneliness have taken to comfort eating, while a quarter now regularly exceed the recommended alcohol consumption limit.But the most common effect of loneliness is missing friends and family - and older people have perhaps felt this most.Nearly three quarters of people over  said they have struggled with loneliness during the lockdown, and two thirds admitted theyve not spoken to anyone about how they have been finding it dficult to cope.  And this may have affected their overall wellbeing as four in  adults with older or vulnerable relatives said they’ve noticed a deterioration in their mental or physical health over recent months.The Santander study, carried out through OnePoll, also found loneliness has proved to be signicantly challenging for those who don’t live with anyone.Currently a fth of the population live alone and  per cent currently feel lonely –  per cent more than those who reside with someone .Further to this, those living alone had gone an average of  days without talking to anyone at all since the lockdown came into effect on  March.To help alleviate loneliness, Santander UK employees are signing up to volunteer with Alzheimer’s Society and Age UK.They will place regular social phone calls to isolated people and those living with dementia, distribute support leaflets, deliver groceries, help older people get online and develop their digital skills, and become ‘Dementia Friends’.The Santander Foundation is donating £, to Age UK and Alzheimer’s Society for every Santander UK employee who takes part in volunteering initiatives - up to £ million.It follows on from an earlier donation by the Santander Foundation to the two charities  totalling £ million - given as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.The total donation of up to £million will be split equally between the two charities, meaning they will receive £.million each.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the independent election monitoring group Golos, has called the overall vote numbers suspicious.We look at neighboring regions, and anomalies are obvious there are regions where the turnout is articially , there are regions where it is more or less real, he told The Associated Press.The ballot comes after Putin surprisingly first proposed the constitutional changes in a state-of-the-nation address in January.He offered to broaden the powers of parliament and redistribute authority among the branches of the Russian government, stoking speculation he might continue calling the shots as parliamentary speaker or as chairman of the State Council when his presidential term ends in .The Russian leaders true intentions only became clear hours before a decisive vote in parliament when legislator Valentina Tereshkova suddenly proposed a measure to let him run two more times.The amendments, which also emphasise the priority of Russian law over international norms, outlaw same-sex marriages and mention a belief in God as a core value, quickly sailed through the Kremlin-controlled legislature.Putin later said he would decide later whether to run again in . He argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants from looking for possible successors instead of doing their jobs.Among those turning out to the polls was a bear cub in Siberia who decided against backing Putin’s plan to become leader for le.Three month old Glasha looked unimpressed at an outdoor polling station set up for Russia’s constitutional plebiscite.The cub almost tipped over some anti-coronavirus sanitiser before  grabbing a pile of voting papers and chucking them on the ground.The handler admitted the bear had been invited to  the polling station, at a secondary school, in a stunt to encourage voters to come to the poll. We received a call last night and were asked to come, said zoo keeper Alexander Chenotaryev.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Almost like a public holiday, and its far from a public holiday. And for policing, policing is tough at the best of times. The easing of this lockdown, especially when you introduce alcohol and opening bars and restaurants - andthe public think like this is going to be how it was in normal times, theyre very much mistaken.Theres going to be signicant restrictions which will create extra pressures.He added: Police is encouraging the Government to choose an alternative date.I completely accept that with universities closed and with many people not in the workplace, evenwe had on a weekday it might have not have made much of a dference, but it could have.On top of it all, its not far from payday, people will have just have been paid and its a full moon, which creates a whole host of other issues.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If I was to be more blunt, I would say that we’ll all be six foot under before it’s even half built at this glacial rate of progress. Boris was at pains to tell us he’s no communist. I think we knew that. What we discovered is that he’s no Franklin D Roosevelt either. President Roosevelt is famous for unlocking mega-bucks to lt America out of the Great Depression in the s. Our Prime Minister’s wallet, by contrast, is a bit thinner. While Roosevelt built the Hoover Dam, Johnson promised some bridge repairs in Sandwell. To be fair, there was some good news for Greater Manchester in the speech. We were give £m to clean up brownfield sites and build more homes on them. This will allow us to make some further inroads into tackling the housing crisis, although much more is needed. I was also pleased to hear the £ billion commitment to upgrade school buildings - though it didn’t escape my notice that it came almost  years to the day since Michael Gove scrapped Labour’s £ billion Building Schools for the Future programme. What the North of England needs more than anything is investment in our Victorian rail infrastructure which is responsible for the timetable chaos of recent years.  So we welcome the Prime Minister’s recognition of the “rail bottleneck” in Manchester City centre in his speech. But we’re not sure about his solution. We already have a plan in place to build two new s at Manchester Piccadilly to solve it. Instead of giving that the green light, the PM chose to allocate £m to develop an alternative plan. How does that fit with his much-vaunted Project Speed  Overall, and not for the first time with this Government, the hype before the speech overshadowed the real thing. There are only a certain number of times that you can promise to dual the A before people begin to switch off. As I said on Monday, “levelling up” needs to be about skin and bone as well as concrete and steel. People are crying out for help now and it would helpthe PM acknowledged this before promising any more shiny projects in the dim and distant future. One of the statistics which haunts me from this crisis was the Unison survey of care workers in the North West. It found % said they feared they wouldn’t be paidthey needed to self-isolate. Just think about that. We have a care service in England which has such poor employment conditions that it forces people to stay in work evenare ill. If the PM had started his speech by promising that, from now on, the heroes who work in our care homes looking after our relatives will get paid at least the same as a nurse, then I think the whole country would have risen to applaud him.

And it has been reported huge amounts of testing data - is not being made public by the government.According to the Financial Times, published data for Leicester recorded just  new positive tests between June  and June .But Matt Hancock revealed the complete figure for that period was in fact . The official statistics ‘dashboard’ - set up by the government last week when the daily coronavirus briefing was cancelled - only publishes data from ’pillar  testing’ at a local level. That means it only includes swab tests performed in hospitals for people with ‘clinical need’ and staff. Test results from centres outside of hospitals - like mobile and drive-through test centres, and at-home testing - are known as ‘pillar ’ testing. Pillar  testing makes up around % of test results - and aren’t included on the dashboard. Neither are they routinely shared with mayors and local councils. They are available to local health officials - but critics say that’s not good enough to help local authorities keep tabs on local outbreaks. Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted that health authorities in her constituency in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had been trying to get hold of local Pillar  testing data but had not been able to. She tweeted: Our local public health teams, council, NHS doctors  managers in Wakefield have had to fight for months to try to get this data. “In public health crisis, most important thing is knowing where infection is. Appalling  incomprehensible that basic info hasnapost been provided. The idea this could have been Ministerial choice rather than failure of competence is even more shocking. “What on earth is going on  Transparency  trust are basic currencies for dealing with public health crises.

Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby criticised the Government and Public Health Englandfor delays in sharing case and testing data which showed how the disease was spreading. He said he had been trying for weeks to access data on the level of testing in the city and was only given access last Thursday.

Working from home became the norm, socialising was forced online and missing loved ones became an everyday occurance. As the virusapos hold begins to ease, some places are beginning to see the strict restrictions lted, but weaposre still a long way from le as we knew it. Non-essential businesses - including pubs - will reopen their doors in England this weekend, and people will finally be able to reunite with family for longer periods of time. But whataposs next  Back in May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed his -page road map plan for getting the UK out of lockdown, both socially and economically. The next big change is due to happen this weekend, with a large number of restrictions being relaxed in England. Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can reopen their doors on Saturday  July and two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closer - but only  they sit side-by-side or wear a mask. However aposlocal lockdownsapos will be introduced for areas experiencing a surge in cases. Leicester was the first city to be forced back indoors in a bid to control the virus, going back to step one of lockdown. There are another  other cities or towns which are deemed at risk and could follow in Leicesteraposs footsteps. And then what  While many things are starting to get back to normal, many businesses and industries are still waiting for the green light to reopen. Nightclubs, bowling alleys, indoor playareas, swimming pools, tattoo studios, water parks and conference centres are just some of the places weaposre still waiting for an update for.  The beauty industry is still at a standstill, with everything except hairdressers - including beauty salons and nail bars - remaining closed. However there may be a light at the end of the tunnel for the fitness industry, including gyms. Despite Government sources says gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces, they could be open in a fortnight. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. The government wants all children to go back to school in September, and parents will face finesthey donapost sent their kids in. A plan is due to be outlined this week on how exactly that will happen. Unions have warned it is impossible to reopen schools while maintaining social distancing - there simply isnapost enough space. Currently, children have to be kept in separate bubbles of  pupils or fewer. So ministers are considering massively expanding these bubbles to cover  pupils - which is basically the whole class - or even an entire year group.

Mark Sheldon, , found pal Gareth Oldroyd, , dead on the sofa at his house after the pair had spent the evening together taking drugs, a court heard this week Sheldon and his housemate, Martin Webley, refused to contact emergency services about the tragedy for fear of getting into trouble with the police, it was heard. They covered Mr Oldroydaposs body with a blanket and continued to live in a bedroom at the house in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after moving the TV out of the living room. The court heard Sheldon failed to raise the alarm despite the dead manaposs panicked loved ones filing a missing person report to the police. Authorities were eventually contacted by one of Sheldonaposs other friends, who became suspicious and challenged the defendant over his behaviour. Sheldon confessed to the man that Mr Oldroyd was dead in the living room and his body was eventually recovered more than a week after he stopped breathing. Appearing in the dock at Leeds Crown Court this week, the defendant was jailed for nine months after pleading guilty to an offence of preventing a lawful and decent burial. Prosecutor James Lake said officers went to the house on December , , where they noticed a strong smell and found Mr Oldroydaposs body in an advanced state of decomposition. Mr Lake said it appeared as though Sheldon and Mr Webley had continued to live at the property as there were left over meals and drinks in the kitchen. Mr Webley would have been facing the same charge but has since died from a drug overdose, the court heard. Mr Lake said: This was an offence that was callous, thoughtless and cruel, in particular to the family of the person who died. Mr Oldroydaposs father, Martin, provided a victim statement to the court describing how Sheldonaposs actions meant they were unable to grieve properly following the death. Mr Lake said: He cannot understand why Mr Webley and this defendant did not make any attempt to inform the police or call the ambulance and instead left a body to decompose. He and his family were unable to see Gareth after his death or visit him at a chapel of rest. Martinaposs statement stated: We do not feel we have been able to grieve his passing away. I am told that they panicked, but my personal thoughts were that they were just selfish and thinking about themselves. The court heard -year-old Mr Oldroyd leaves behind a three-year-old daughter.

Hotel supports hospital heroes with meals  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Laura McKenzie had a flood of cancelled bookings at her Glasgow hotel, Cathedral House. The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming!

Things we took for granted – the night out at the pub, trip to the cinema, mini-break in a European capital – belong in the past. Even our vocabulary has changed, words like shielding, self-isolation, the R number and lockdown itself now common.The Oxford English Dictionary added  coronavirus words, including “elbow bump”, in April.Here are some other ways the lockdown has changed Britain in the past  days.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereFinance With shops closed and long queues at supermarkets, more Brits than ever started doing their shopping online, or buying their groceries local. One in five British households bought groceries online in the past month, pumping up sales for home delivery by %, while small independent stores rang up % more sales in the three months to  June, according to analysts Kantar. Nearly half of debit card transactions are now made online, while older generations in particular have seen their internet spending rise, to % of transactions from just % a year ago. And with cash seen as a potential vector for spreading the virus, and the contactless limit raised to £, the decline of cash has accelerated too. Withdrawals from ATM fell as much as % year on year during the lockdown, according to data from cash machine network, Link. But while nearly two million UK households are set to emerge from restrictions better off after saving money, those with incomes less than £, are more likely to have borrowed money and face a dficult future. Economy  And figures have now shown the UK economy shrank .% between January and March, the joint largest fall since . The International Monetary Fundwarns the world is set to take a £. trillion Covid- hit, and Britain’s economy will plunge by .% in . Some experts say we should expect levels of unemployment of three million or more, while the Centre for Retail Research predicts as many as , shops could close this year. Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston are just some of those hit hard already. Workers furloughed fear redundancy once employers need to start paying some of their wages in August. Meanwhile, the way we work may have changed forever. Many have seen the benefits to work-le balance of working from home and video calls, with , working parents surveyed by Bright Horizons showing only around one in eight want toto pre-pandemic ‘normal’. One in  business premises in London have already permanently closed. Communication  We’ve all had to find new ways to communicate. Unknown to most before lockdown, millions are now familiar with video conferencing app Zoom, which by the end of April had over million daily meeting participants. And older people have also become tech-savvy, with % of elderly residents in of parts of the UK regularly using Zoom, WhatsApp and FaceTime to connect with loved ones.Lockdown has also given us the chance to meet our neighbours – whether it’s saying “hello” over the garden fence, going into the street to clap for carers, or getting together in community Whatsapp groups and Facebook pages.However, social media has had its downsides, with a study finding that those who believed in conspiracy theories were more likely to get Covid- information from Facebook or YouTube. Of those, % believed coronavirus was created in a lab and % claimed it didn’t exist at all. Sport  When the Premier League restarted on June  there were cheers from football fans across the country. And no more so than when Liverpool won their first Premier League title in  years. But things were far from normal as matches took place behind closed doors and fans could pay to have a cardboard cut-out of themselves in the stadium seats of their favourite team. And imagine telling a football fan back in January that they’d be able to use the red button to turn fake crowd noises on and off during a match Meanwhile, while some big events such Royal Ascot and the darts PDC tour were given the green light to go ahead, others, such as Wimbledon and the Olympics were forced to reschedule.Relationships  More than % of people say that lockdown has had a positive effect on their lives. And, of these respondents, more than half said they were able to spend more quality time with the loved ones they lived with. Meanwhile, absence has made the heart grow fonder and helped us appreciate family members more than ever. And % of new couples say the pandemic has made their relationship stronger. But there’s been some hurdles to overcome. Parents have been homeschooling their kids for  days. Yet only % of working class parents feel confident in doing so. And sadly, there’s been a % increase in orce inquiries. The Environment  This was our lockdown silver lining. Studies found daily global carbon dioxide emissions fell by % compared with  levels thanks to the shut down of industry and traffic at the start. As le stilled, wildle began reclaiming the empty spaces. Goats took to the streets of Llandudno, buzzards ed to Hampstead Heath and after the National Trust closed their properties, rangers reported rare animal sightings. While CO levels still rose, reaching . parts per million in May - .ppm higher than the peak of .ppm in  - scientists say that without Covid-, the rise might have reached .ppm. NHS and key workers  The nation’s clap – or pan rattle – for carers, thanking our NHS, social care and key workers, became strict Thursday night routine. Rainbows in our windows thanked them. As many of us worked from home, we appreciated others were taking a risk to support us and save lives. After the Prime Minister himself thanked the NHS for saving his own, our health service can surely never be undervalued again. But too many workers paid with their lives. Most – some analysis suggests % - from BAME groups. Schools universities  Parents tried their best to homeschool, but four in ten pupils across England have not been in regular contact with their teachers since schools shut. Another report estimates around one in five UK pupils have done no schoolwork or managed less than an hour a day. While seven out of  state school pupils have had just one online lesson or less per day, almost a third of private schools have been providing four or more, exposing a widening gap between the rich and poor. Meanwhile, older students, forced to take virtual exams and accept predicted marks, fear downgrades. Many are planning to defer university, too, as online learning and student ‘bubbles’ are considered. Cambridge University has already announced all learning will be online until summer . Politics  The daily press briefing has meant we have seen more of the government than ever. Record numbers of million of us were glued initially – although that later shrunk to million.Meanwhile, confidence in Boris Johnson and the Tories has shrunk, too.At the start of lockdown, three in four Brits agreed with government handling of the pandemic. A recent YouGov poll shows the British government has the lowest domestic approval rating in the world  for its handling of Covid-.The PM’s approval ratings sit at just %, not helped by the revelation his top aide Dominic Cummings flouted lockdown rules. An Opinium poll showed % of voters think Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would be better at leading the country, compared to % for Boris.Hobbies at home As we’re unable to go out, we’ve had to find new ways to amuse ourselves. Flour production had to increase  fold to keep up with the surge in home baking. And, by April, there were over .million photos tagged “sourdough” on Instagram.Lockdown has also given us the time to start those tedious household jobs and the three-hour long queue outside Ikea and BQ showed just how much DIY we had to do. We’ve also been making the most of home comforts, with slipper sales doubling in some stores, such as John Lewis and a % increase in TV viewing. Meanwhile, for those who wanted a bit of fun there have been countless Zoom quizzes, and the sale of alcohol at supermarkets soared. For animal lovers, working from home has also provided the perfect opportunity to get a pet – with online searches for getting a puppy surging %. Exercise  Gyms closing saw theof the home workout. Many elite gyms, such as Barry’s Bootcamp and Rebel started streaming their classes on social media for free.Before lockdown, few people had heard of Joe Wicks, who has given millions of children the taste of a daily exercise routine, while celebrities such as Tyson Fury, Naomi Campbell and Gregg Wallace, also started sharing their workout regimes with fans.Perhaps the most unlikely motivator was Boris Johnson, who announced lockdown urging people to exercise once a day. A Bupa study found that % of Brits have upped their usual exercise and bike sales have increased by %. On the down side, .million eager exercisers have injured themselves during lockdown, with men twice as likely as women to get hurt. Royals  Despite not being able to attend public engagements, the Royals have made sure to maintain their duties by switching to video calls during lockdown. William, Kate, Charles, Camilla and other members of the royal family kept busy with their charity work online - even turning into bingo callers for a care home in Cardf. And members of the royal family have also been volunteering, particularly the Countess of Wessex, who has been organising PPE shipments and working in a charity shop.

The popular tourist attraction will open its doors on July  for the first time in more than three months as lockdown measures ease in England. Pictures taken from inside the park show guests will have a completely dferent experience. Like zoos, anyone wanting to visit Alton Towers will have to pre-book for entry, with the park opening at limited capacity. Queues will be spaced out to ensure people are social distancing, and face masks will be compulsory for anyone over the age of six on certain rides, including Nemesis, Galactica, Oblivion, The Smiler, Wicker Man, Rita, THTEEN and Runaway Mine Train. At the park entrance, temperature checks will be carried out with a non-touch thermometer. Anyone with a temperature over . degrees will be denied entry.The majority of rides and outdoor attractions will reopen, but some indoor facilities will stay shut, BirminghamLive reports.Staff will also wear PPE and rides will be thoroughly cleaned regularly.  Last month, incredible drone footage showed an eerily empty Alton Towers as operators worked on the rides at dizzying heights. Other rollercoasters such as The Smiler sit eerily empty while carriages can be seen going around tracks on other rides - but with no passengers on board. The Alton Towers website reads: In line with the latest Government guidance, we are delighted to confirm that Alton Towers Resort will reopen on the  July . We can’t wait to welcome you back.This follows the successful opening of the Alton Towers Gardens earlier this month, and is in line with the UK Government guidance on the reopening of open-air attractions.  From  July, the rest of the theme park will reopen, including the majority of our rides and outdoor attractions, although some indoor facilities must remain closed for now.  We will reopen with signicantly reduced numbers and a range of hygiene and safety measures to protect you and our employees.All guests must bring a suitable mask with them when they visit our attraction. Only securely fitted face masks should be worn on rides for safety reasons and we would recommend removing face masks on water rides in case they get wet.

New figures show  cities or counties across England are seeing a fresh rise in lab-confirmed cases, meaning infections are rising in almost one in four cities and counties. Doncaster, second behind Leicester, is among the places that have seen a worrying spike. Derbyshire is one of the counties where cases are higher than other regions. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdresses and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. Public health officials are keeping an eye on Doncaster and other areas that have seen a signicant increase in cases in recent weeks as England gradually emerged from its Covid- lockdown with the reopening of schools and easing of other restrictions. In Leicester there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children, the Health Secretary has said. Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected by the outbreak, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus.Lab-confirmed cases in Leicester have been rising week-on-week, from  between June - to  in the week of June -. Mr Hancock said the cityaposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per ,. Leicester City Council said it had seen  confirmed cases of Covid- in the past two weeks. The Health Secretary said that of course the Government was looking at similar places but said the outbreak in Leicester was very signicantly worse than the next worst-hit place. These  areas ranked behind Leicester, which had the highest number of new lab-confirmed cases, according to the latest available data from Public Health England. Many are urban, densely populated and ethnically erse areas. Five are in London and two are in Kent. Doncaster, South Yorkshire New cases between June -:  New cases between June -:  Total cases:  Derbyshire June -:  June -:  Total: , Hammersmith and Fulham, west London June -:  June -:  Total:   Ealing, west London Medway, Kent June -:  June -:  Total:  Ealing, west London June -:  June -:  Total: ,  Hounslow, west London June -:  June -:  Total:   Thanet, Kent June -:  June -:  Total: Westminster, central London June -:  June -:  Total:  Brent, north-west London June -:  June -:  Total: , Staffordshire Moorlands June -:  June -:  Total:   Speaking to BBC Breakfast earlier on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester. He said that even though children are less likely to get ill from the disease, the decision to shut the cityaposs schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.  Mr Hancock added: We have sent in a lot of extra testing into Leicester over the last  days or so and one of the things we have found is that there are under-s who have tested positive and therefore, because children can transmit the disease - even though they are highly unlikely to get ill from the disease - we think the safest thing to do is close the schools. The reason I said what I did last night about Leicester is that it is an unusually high incidence in children in Leicester. Mr Hancock also said that the lockdown had been introduced in Leicester after targeted action at factories and workplaces had failed. He added: We have been monitoring it incredibly closely, we have put in extra testing units, some of the schools in Leicester were closed already. We also went into some of the factories and workplaces where there was an outbreak and we put in place measures. These sort of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So weaposve been taking this highly localised approach, but unfortunately that targeted action wasnapost working in Leicester and thataposs why we have taken this much broader measure. When asked about possible causes such as poverty, higher ethnic ersity, language dficulties and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said they were familiar to him.He added: We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me and people will find them intuitive. North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said that Leicester was a perfect storm of a city with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries. The Conservative MP told BBC Radio  Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on.Mr Bridgen added: What we have seen in Leicester is a perfect storm really, you have got a city which has generally got younger people living in it. We know younger people have been less likely to comply with lockdown rules. We have got the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown. On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry. And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which should have locked down which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during the lockdown and they have carried on working as well.

Unlike many royals before her, she opted for looks which really showed off her beautul growing bump, and she was glowing at every engagement she attended while waiting for little Archie to arrive. However a new book has claimed that not everybody was so impressed by her maternity wardrobe, and says some of her looks earned her a stern telling off. In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett write: There were considerable rumblings over Meghan’s appearance. In the early days of the pregnancy, insiders said that Meghan had earned a stern telling-off. However Meghanaposs fashionable look didnapost come cheap, and the Duchessapos maternity wardrobe - featuring  outfits - reportedly cost £,.While there were a couple of high street items showcased, for the most part, Meghanaposs maternity wear was high-end - and had the price tag to match. According to lovethesales Meghanaposs top brands during her pregnancy have been Aquazzura, Givenchy, Stuart Weitzman and Outland Denim.  This figure is said to be seven times the amount the Duchess of Cambridge spent on her pregnancy wardrobe. However itaposs believed the tax paying public do NOT foot her and Kateaposs clothes bill. As well as having wealth in her own right, Meghanaposs wardrobe will also be paid for out of a privy income provided by Prince Charlesapos Duchy of Cornwall.  In the book, which is released later this month, Howard and Tillett also claim that Meghanaposs pregnancy announcement raised a few eyebrows, and reportedly left Harry embarrassed.The couple told the world they were expecting their first child on the eve of their royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, but shared the happy news with close family at the Harryaposs cousinaposs wedding a few days before.

Fiona Donohoe wants mums and dads at the time of her son Noahaposs funeral today to stay at home and be with them. Noah went missing for a week, before his body was tragically found in a storm drain in Belfast on Saturday. Police believe he may have fallen from his bicycle and hurt his head. Mum Fiona said: At the time of the funeral, I want everyone to be at home with their children. Embrace them and cherish them, for every moment with them is precious.” The private funeral is set to be held at am in St Patrickaposs Church, Belfast. The Donohoe family, in a statement on Sunday, expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the support, outpouring of love, and empathy they received in the past few days. From walking with us, both physically and spiritually, to feeling our pain, we recognise that everyone has lost Noah, said the family. He was very special. It is very hard to do justice or honour the extraordinary relationship Noah and his mummy shared. In his  years his mummy got so much from their special bond, he taught his mummy so much. They were each otheraposs world. Noahaposs mummy always told him that he would change the world, they said. They added: Noah loved his school and his friends at school, and we know that they will be grieving too and they need to say goodbye too. A vigil was held on Sunday where prayers were said for Noah and his family members. A total of  blue balloons were released in his memory.  Paul McBride, the principal of Saint Malachyaposs College where Noah went to school, said the whole school mourned his loss. He said the school was deeply saddened by the death of Noah who he described as a natural leader with a caring nature, calm demeanour and big smile. In a statement posted on the school website, Mr McBride said: The whole college family mourns the tragic loss of our young Malachian, Noah Donohoe. Noah embraced fully all aspects of school le. He was an active and prominent member of the Music Department, and as a talented young cellist, Noah was able to enhance the lives of his fellow performers and also many an audience.  He was a natural leader who led by example. His caring nature, calm demeanour and big smile were some of his great gts that helped others do their best. He was also a keen basketball and rugby player both in and out of school. He has been described as the perfect gentleman who was also able to show a genuine competitive spirit on the court. One of his teachers and coach said that Noah had a heart of a lion being able to express himself on the pitch, shouting, laughing and having fun with his friends whilst in class he was normally measured and modest.  Members of the search and rescue team who worked to help find Noah gathered outside the gates of St Malachyaposs in Belfast on Sunday evening to pay tribute to him. On Saturday, police in Belfast said that a body found in north Belfast was his.

The Duke of Sussex reportedly starting splashing the cash after leaving Kensington Palace, which he shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. What followed was a series of extravagant purchases fit for a king, including Harry and Meghan Markleaposs Windsor wedding. The couple then spent £.million of tax payeraposs money refurbishing Frogmore Cottage in the town - money they have pledged to repay following their split from the Royal Family. Now Meghan and Harry are staying at acting and director Tyler Perryaposs millionmansion in Hollywood, Mail Online reports. While they do they are reportedly paying £, a month to keep Frogmore Cottage as their official UK base. During Meghanaposs pregnancy with Prince Archie royal watchers and fashion mathematicians came together to estimate how much she spent on maternity clothes. They concluded that the Duchess forked out £,.  Now Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett have claimed in their new book Royals at War that it is such splurges that led to a rt forming between Princes Harry and William. Part of the book reads: Harry’s [spending] transformation is revealed as one of the fundamental factors behind the deep fissure that opened between him and his brother, Prince William. Elsewhere they claim: The fact that Meghan splashed so much cash rang alarm bells with the traditionally conservative Queen Elizabeth.  Growing up in the war left the monarch with a built-in sense of frugality and economy, despite being one of the richest women in the world. According to the writers Kate Middleton was worried that Harry and Meghan were falling for each other too quickly and decided to take the young prince to one side.

However insiders have claimed that things werenapost as perfect behind the scene as everyone believed, and Dianaaposs fears about Charlesaposs ex Camilla started before they said their vows. Insiders say she frequently asked Charles about the nature of their close bond in their lead up to their Royal Wedding in . But her heart was shattered just a few days before she said her vows when she walked into his private secretary Michael Colborneaposs office. She saw a package sitting on the desk with Camillaaposs name written on it, and demanded to see what was inside of it. She found a gold bracelet engraved with the letters G and F, which stood for Gladys and Fred - the nicknames Charles and Camilla used for each other. Speaking in Channel  documentary, Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding, biographer Christopher Wilson said: I think she was very suspicious of anything Camilla. She asked to see what was inside and eventually she was allowed to have her way. She was absolutely in tears, in a terrible state about it. It was clear that this was Prince Charlesapos farewell present to Camilla.

Craig Harker, who runs The George Pub and Grill in Stockton, is looking to fill five positions at three pubs after the government announced bars and restaurants would be able to reopen their doors on July .The roles for bar staff, a kitchen chef, a pot washer and an apprentice front of house were posted on social media and racked up hundreds of comments - but it was the wording of the advert which attracted attention, as reported by Teeside Live.Serving up a taste of whataposs to come, Craig begins the advert by stating: Yes youaposll be working for an a***hole but who isnapost these days lol but Iaposm a fair one and everyone who works for me enjoys being at work. He advises anyone hopeful of landing a role to show up smart and presentable, adding: Dont come to an interview with your chipped finger nails, scraggly hair and just been on a session red eye. Come looking to impress me. If you come and your clothes are creased to bits then I wont be having your lazy a*** anywhere behind my bar. Before you come downyou feel your breath is a little tangy then it probably is, get yourself a tic tac before your burn my eyes.  In the description for a bar person, it states anyone with banter like a aposwet flannelapos should look where because I donapost have the time or patience to teach someone how to be sociable just because youaposve played Call of duty for the last  years instead of having proper mates. For the same role in another pub, applicants are told professional experience is essential, not home bar experience or the fact you made everyone a jager bomb in the park using crisp packets. Although thataposs creative itaposs not what Iaposm after. The advert for a pot washer reads: Yep itaposs one of those grubby jobs but you get good pot washers and s**** ones. Iaposm after a good one. Pot wash athletes only. The post has had more than  shares and  comments, so it looks like the brutally honest advert successfully got the word out there - but not everyone was impressed. One wrote: I find the way you have approached it to be completely unprofessional andthat’s what your like before you employ I dread to think what it would be like once employed!

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.

Unfortunately I think we should. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places, he said. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks. But how exactly will local lockdowns be decided and forced  And what will it look like to be in a city forced into local lockdown  How the local lockdown will work in Leicester Leicester is the first place where a local lockdown has been implemented - and here are the changes that have happened in the city. The lockdown there seems similar to the rules imposed UK-wide at the end of March. People in Leicester must once again “stay at home as much as you can” and cease non-essential travel.  Yesterday, non-essential shops in Leicester were told they must close all over again. Primary schools which opened to some pupils from June  must once again close, to all but the most vulnerable or children of key workers, from this Thursday. Pubs, restaurants, hotels, hairdressers and more in the city will not reopen as in the rest of England on July . And shielding for vulnerable people will not be eased in Leicester when it is in the rest of England on July .  Why did the lockdown happen in Leicester  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Leicesteraposs seven-day infection rate is  cases per ,, which is three times higher than the next highest city. He revealed % of all positive cases in the country over the past week have been in Leicester. Residents said people had been widely flouting social distancing and other measures when the government first began easing rules two weeks ago.  I thinkpeople listened and stayed at home, then we wouldnapost be here, said Bob Sharma, a bank manager. Pawn broker Arun Mortala said people had not been wearing masks or keeping distance when back on high streets. I was expecting that this was going to happen, he said.  Could apostargeted actionapos work on specic offices, factories or schools Matt Hancock said the city wide lockdown in Leicester had been imposed because targeted action had failed to work, according to the BBC. But when many coronavirus cases are found in one place, local directors of public health can close the premises. Who makes the decision on when a local lockdown is needed  The BBC says that the local director of public health and the Health and Safety Executive can temporarily shut down a single premises. But in the case of a town, city or region, it is a number of organisations which together decide. Local alerts can be flagged to Englandaposs chief medical officer who can advise a minister.

Tricia Hurt was boating on Marsh-Miller Lake in Wisconsin, US, with her husband Brian and son Brady when they saw the distressed bear desperately trying to swim to safety with a cheese puff tub covering its head. The brave family slowly tried to pull up alongside the animal to set it free, but the bear gets spooked by the boat and quickly begins to paddle away. Brady manoeuvres into position as his dad Brian makes a grab for the container, but itaposs too wet and slips from his grip as Tricia captures the young black bearaposs terried face as it looked out from behind the plastic, which is slowly filling with water. Unwilling to accept defeat, they circle the boat around for a second attempt as quickly as possible, knowing every second counts. The boat again pulls alongside the bear and Brian, , makes a firm grab, yanking the tub off its head as the confused animal makes an attempt to claw at his hands. Tricia tells the bear to swim happy after their incredible efforts to save it, and they watched on as the cub reaches the shore, where it lays down exhausted from the ordeal.  The mum said: We couldnapost believe it when we saw the cheese puffs container wedged on the poor bearaposs head.

But combing too hard or even brushing with the wrong hairbrush can cause long-term damage.Hair brand Tangle Teezer has conducted a study to see just how many women are concerned about the damage their doing to their hair, reports the Daily Star.And, the results are in - out of the , women surveyed, four in  are worried that some of their actions are bad for their hair, and more than one in  even admitted to using the old tip to brush your hair  times before bed - yikes. A fth of women believed it was fine to brush their roughly in order to get through any knots or tangles, and a fth admit to sharing a hair brush, which, Tangle Teezer founder Shaun Pulfrey, known as Shaun P, says is a big no-no. One of the biggest mistakes people are making is brushing their hair from the scalp down, which can lead to split ends, more knots and ultimately, damaged hair. Instead you should start at the ends of your hair and work your way up. This ensures that all of the tangles are tackled carefully without ripping any hair out in the process.Shaun P said: It’s worrying to see just how many women are brushing their hair incorrectly and causing unnecessary damage to their hair.No matter what the hair texture, it’s important to use an intelligent hairbrush which is gentle. It’s also concerning that women are using one brush for all tasks, a good way to look at this is you wouldn’t use a foundation brush to apply blusher, so why use a detangling brush to blow dry hair  No matter how tempting it is to pull or cut knots, it’s always best to use a detangling hairbrush. What you shouldnapost be doing - but definitely areAvoiding brushing when itaposs wet over fears this will break the hair Brushing too hard Brushing from the scalp downwards Using an old and worn hairbrush Using a hairbrush that isn’t specically for detangling Sharing a hairbrush Ripping out big knots  tangles instead of gently combing through them Not using a hairbrush specically for your hair type Using a hairbrush that doesn’t have flexible teeth  bristles Using one hairbrush for everythingThe study also found that three quarters of women admitted to using the same hairbrush for all aspects of their hair care. Itaposs vital to use dferent tools for dferent tasks like combing wet hair, detangling and blow drying. And, while  per cent of women only own one or two hairbrushes, a sixth have more than seven make-up brushes. But, although  per cent of women have a specic routine for their locks, more than half admitted they do not knowthey are using the right brush for their hair type. In terms of what products women are using, less than a quarter of those polled regularly use hair masques,  per cent admit to not using any heat protection spray at all and more than a fth apply oils. The biggest concern for women in the UK were split ends,  per cent, frizz,  per cent and thinning hair at  per cent. Shaun P added: We have created dferent brushes and adapted the teeth to suit all hair types, to give the perfect brush for all hair textures – be it afro hair, thick and curly or fine, thinning, fragile and straight.

But it only takes a second to see that his favourite meal is fish and chips, as classic dish features on the menu twice. The first night he chooses to have it is clearly exciting as he adds yay after the meal. Fish itself is also seen a further two more times on the plan. On the other days he asks for chicken, takeaways and pizza - a dreamy selection. And he has clearly been brought up not to waste food, as he makes sure to incorporate leftovers into his meal plan too. He suggests eating pizza - which he planned to have as a Sunday night treat - the following Saturday. But not fresh pizza, leftover pizza... Weaposre not so sure how week-old pizza would taste, but why not  Parents in the group found his plan both sweet and impressive, and his repetitive choice of fish and chips comical.

This should involve a referendum designed in Scotland where a last invitation is offered to the UK to participate to put the case to remain in the union.#A request to the EU to sanction this referendum should be made and every attempt to involve them in the designing of that referendum should be pursued.#mdash Pete WishartJune , Mr Wishart#s preference is to secure an #irrefutable mandate# by winning a majority at next year#s Holyrood election with a #clear and unambiguous commitment to hold a referendum#, and then #move quickly# with the participation of the UK.However, he believessuch a mandate is rejected, Scotland should seek approval from the EU to design a process for rejoining as a #substate# # despite there being no current provision for this within the body#s existing rules.The influential MP also wants Scotland to look at #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state# and informally acquire responsibilities currently exercised by the UK Government, which could include withdrawing from institutions at Westminster.#What we have to demonstrate is that we have tried absolutely everything possible to secure the UK as a participant in resolving the question of our democratic right to consider our nation’s future,# Mr Wishart said.#We have to conclusively convince the EU and the international community that no stone has been left unturned in trying to engage them as a partner in resolving this democratically and constitutionally.#Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union hit out at Mr Wishart for spending time on the #route map# and called for him to instead to focus efforts on tackling the coronavirus crisis.She said: #It tells you everything about the SNP that Pete Wishart#s priority is a route map to separation, rather than a route map to economic recovery for the people of Scotland.#Even before the coronavirus crisis, the SNP#s blueprint for leaving the UK acknowledged there would be economic hardship # now it would be manestly worse.#The majority of people want their elected representatives to focus on bringing people together as we face the harsh reality of a deep recession with many job losses.#It#s also vital to remember that at election time people vote for parties on a wide range of issues.

What a woman.“To the players and staff I’ve worked alongside during my time, it’s been a pleasure.#Meekings continued: “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed most of my time at the club and wish that the ending could have been dferent and we could have played out the season to see what happened.“However, having been open to staying, unfortunately, after having discussions with the club over the weekend, it became clear that they were not in a position to retain me for the   season.“I understand the circumstances and the financial constraints that the club are facing, and wish everybody all the best for the coming season.“We remain on good terms and the decision to move on has been an amicable one. I enjoyed playing under Jazz and I’m sorry that we will not get the opportunity to keep working together.“Lastly, thank you to all the fans for your support and good luck!”Meekings made  appearances in three seasons on Tayside, with the last two as skipper.The news of the Englishman’s departures comes on the back of the Dee last week asking players to take wage cuts of up to % as they continue to feel the pinch of the Covid- shutdown.The club expect to hear back from the squad this week after making the request and remain positive about the outcome.Jimmy Nicholl tips Dundee first-team coach Dave Mackay to replace him as assistant manager\" title\"#Jimmy Nicholl tips Dundee first-team coach Dave Mackay to replace him as assistant manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp jimmy-nicholl-tips-dundee-first-team-coach-dave-mackay-to-replace-him-as-assistant-manager embed # secretiFjFSL\" data-secret\"iFjFSL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"No  Jimmy Nicholl and sport scientist Cammy McDermid have already left the club as they attempt to cut costs.Elsewhere, season tickets are back on sale, with the Dark Blues reporting early signs suggest uptake is greatly improved after the initial failed launch.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Here#s why we should look to reduce our own waste, and who the business owners making change are.The next time you pay a visit to the supermarket, glance down to your trolley full of goods and assess just how much plastic you are purchasing.Quite a lotmy predictions are correct.And although many of us are buying into government recycling schemes by dropping off waste at recycling centres, we#ve still not entirely bought into the #buy less plastic# mantra, and instead, continue to purchase plastic and recycle.But whatwe stopped buying products that come in plastic and opt for a dferent approach While programmes like BBC#s Blue Planet and War on Plastic with Hugh and Anita highlight and explore the mess plastic is leaving our oceans and planet in, businesswomen closer to home are doing what they can to help our local communities combat this growing issue.According to figures from Zero Waste Scotland, more than , tonnes of plastic food packaging and plastic bottles is chucked into household general rubbish bins and sent to landfill every year in Scotland, costing the country a staggering £m each year.One woman leading the charge in Aberdeenshire is Lauren Brook who owns zero-waste store and cafe, Butterfly Effect.Opening her premises in August last year, Lauren has worked hard to fulfil her refillery store dreams and made the decision to open her own outlet after her experience as a childminder left her baffled by the amount of plastic coming through her home.She said: #I have always been conscious of the environment and when I was a child minder I noticed the kids would come in with lots of plastic. My bins would be full within a week and I couldn#t stomach knowing how much waste there was.#When you look into it, there#s a lot. I had the idea to launch my own store about seven to eight years ago an when my little boy went to school last year, it seemed like the perfect time to launch my own store.#There were no other zero-waste stores in Aberdeenshire at that point. There#s around seven in the area now which is really cool and we#ve got a nice community where we can share ideas. Its not about making profit, its about making a dference and one less piece of plastic in the world is good for everyone.#Experiencing huge demand during lockdown, Lauren says her store experienced a large spike in new customers, which she describes as #very promising#.#We couldn#t keep up with demand at the start of lockdown. Looking at our shop reports, out of  people who come into the shop in any one day,  were new customers. The best part is we#ve seen so many people coming back to us,# said Lauren.#If you don#t have your own containers you want to take, we have compostable bags that customers can use. But we do encourage people to take their own containers. My top tip would be to take each room at a time, looking at how you can reduce your waste in dferent ways.#People are coming away from the supermarkets and its great to see more buying less plastic. We tried really hard to meet the needs of all of our customers and they liked that we would go the extra mile for them. A few of our elderly customers went into isolation to shield so we dropped goods off to them.#Adding new services to her store and cafe including soft serve ice cream from Rizza#s Ice Cream, it#s her latest product, her oat milk, Lauren says could be a game changer for the business.#Because I#m a cafe as well there#s a lot that you can#t do with regards to food and drink and the environmental health as most items need to come in plastic. We have a lot of plant-based customers so I looked into making oat milk in glass bottles to refill. I thought it could be a side business as Kirsty from Bare # Zero Waste Living also had the same idea so I think we#ll team up. I#ve sold out of it the past few weeks, and its great to see so many people using it.#I#m looking into a second shop for the future. My cafe and community hub has such an amazing buzz to it and with the help from local council and the government with small loans and not having to pay business rates, now is a great opportunity to look into it.#We just want people to keep thinking about our planet, and we can only hope, that after lockdown, things will change for the better and less people will use their car to go to work and that sort of thing.#In Dundee Jillian Elizabeth of The Little Green Larder is also on a mission to reduce plastic waste with her zero-waste store.Launched in July , the former hair and make-up artist was tired of seeing so much waste in the industry and was desperately awaiting for someone to open up a store in the city.When no one came to her rescue, Jillian decided to take on the challenge herself.She said: #I wanted a shop like this to shop in myself because I was struggling to buy food without plastic. I kept waiting for someone to open one and no one ever did, so I went for it and as a result I#ve been able to help loads of other people reduce their plastic, too.#In the first year we#ve tripled what we have in stock. We started with basic refillable and plastic-free foods like reads, a few cakes, fresh fruit and vegetables and refillable larder items like pasta, grains and rice. We also have eco-friendly alternatives for day-to-day items.#People would ask for things and we#d get them in. We#ve just bought a big fridge with heaps of local juices like Bad Gal Boocha and Alba Cola and things like that. I#ve added olives and vine leaves, antipasti and more. Customers wanted things like sushi rice and more ieties of grains and pastas. We#re always adding new things.#Supplying everyday items many of the supermarkets were struggling to keep up with demand on, Jillian said the initial lockdown period was very hectic but was also great for those who didn#t want to brave the supermarket as often.She said: #At the start of lockdown there was a huge increase in people coming to the shop because we had things they needed. People were realising they could keep foods in their cupboards for ages, so they didn#t have to go to the supermarket as much. We had double the amount of people every day. We closed the shop to customers eventually and did a click and collect service # just to keep things safe for everyone.#We#re open again and loads of people have come back to us. We try and support as many local businesses in the shop as we can. We also want to educate as many people as we can about how easy it is to reduce waste. It is also safe for people to bring their own containers to re-fill, so people don#t need to worry about that.#Our biggest seller is porridge oats and red lentils. We have a big range of vegan pick and mix sweets and they are super popular. We went vegan with the pick and mix, not just because it is cruelty-free, but it means almost everyonecan enjoy it. We#ve got the biggest vegan pick and mix selection in Dundee.#Revealing a new website where customers can purchase goods online, Jillian has also partnered with a local delivery service which uses electric eco cars to get her products to her customers in the most environmentally-friendly ways possible.#We#ve just launched a website where you can order a fruit and veg or a mixed box, as well as other items from the shop. Customers can get the fresh stuff via click and collect and the other items delivered to their door. Zippy D, a local delivery company with electric eco cars is helping with food deliveries to people#s houses.#We#re also a collection point for TerraCycle which specialises in hard-to-recycle materials. We had to close the service due to COVID- but I think we#ve collected over , crisp packets for recycling. We#ve got boxes and boxes of them. We have a toothbrush recycling scheme and have collected around , too.#Posted by Grain  Sustain # Zero Waste Le in Fe onSaturday,  October The owner of Grain and Sustain in Burntisland, Fe, Louise Humpington, is also passionate about educating new customers about their purchasing habits and opened her zero-waste shop last October. Louise, too, did not have access to this kind of store and wanted to bring it to her local community.She said: #We did it as we wanted to be as sustainable as possible. My background is in human rights and advocacy and campaigning, and my husband#s is in climate change. We wanted to use the shop as a  to push the messaging we feel is important in becoming zero-waste and educating customers about the environment without preaching about it.Posted by Grain  Sustain # Zero Waste Le in Fe onTuesday,  April #Depending on the time of year, red lentils are popular in winter and soup season, during lockdown it has been flour, yeast, caster sugar and all those sorts of things. We#ve seen a lot of people moving towards a more plant-based diet, too, so the pulses and grains and other yeasts have been popular.Posted by Grain  Sustain # Zero Waste Le in Fe onFriday,  May #We wanted to bring in things like seaweed seasoning, preserved lemon, black salts which are a bit dferent. I#m watching a lot of MasterChef and The Great British Bake Off to see what new, unusual ingredients we can stock.#Like Jillian, Louise also runs a website alongside her store and can sell UK-wide and has more than  products available to purchase now.She said: #Most of the items in the shop are on the website and we#ve got a local delivery service as well. Lockdown definitely pushed us to focus on it more.#We started off with  products on retail and we now have over . That#s come from customers looking for dferent things and sourcing what we can for them. We#d really like to look at frozen goods on retail and add a refrigerated section, too.#Adding things like local craft gins and other items is definitely something we#re looking into. We support  local producers and that#s really important to us. It#s a hub not only for the community, but for local businesses, too. We want to help as many people as we can.#The store offers an alternative to supermarket shopping and focuses on stocking sustainable, ethical and plastic-free products.As well as a range of local fresh fruit and vegetables, the shop boasts a iety of dried store cupboard goods, not to mention bathroom products and kitchen cleaning items.Posted by The Re:Store Moray onSaturday,  May Relitively new to the Aberdeen scene, this store in the west end of the city boasts a range of eco-friendly, sustainable and organic products. With everything from nuts, grains and pastas, to tea, coffee, herbs, spices and oils, not to mention refillable cleaning products and cosmetics, everything you need is under the one roof.

The section of George Street it occupies is pedestrianised yet the majority of the units opposite are empty and run down.Compare that to the hive of business activity and occupied shops along George Street on the other side of St Andrew Street where parking and traffic are allowed and the picture is stark.I’m sure there are other factors involved, like lower rents and rates, but the fact remains. If a pedestrianised zone next to a major retail unit and shopping centre doesn’t work for other businesses, then why should it where in Aberdeen My solution would be at least a trial period of pedestrianisation over the weekends, when people have more leisure time and are not at work or school, for the sections of Union Street and the Belmont Zone, and allow vehicular access to all businesses in the area for deliveries and drop-offs during the week days.Best of both worlds and at least we would not end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater!Ian Cukrowski, MacBeans Coffee Roasters, Little Belmont St, AberdeenFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet-flights-abroad---destination-list-july-1","story":"EasyJet is to beginhundreds more international flights from airports across the UK from next week.The airline said it will restart the international and domestic flights from Wednesday, July , as it also secured a major cash injection to bolster its finances in the face of the pandemic.Where will EasyJet fly to Holidaymakers will be able to fly from  airports across the UK to a number of countries including France, Spainand Italy.From the start of next month, it will run around  flights each day across Europe, including over  flights a week to and from the UK.On June , it restarted a ldquosmall number of flights for the first time since its aircraft were grounded in March.EasyJet said it plans to fly about half of its , routes in July, before increasing to about  per centin August.Air bridges will be available from next weekThe announcement follows reports that air bridges will be available from next week to allow Britons to take holidays in other countries without quarantining for  days.The UK Government will finalise agreements in coming days to allow people to travel from the UK to a small number of countries including Spain, France and Greece - according to reporting by The Times, The Sun and The Daily .What hasEasyJet said Robert Carey, chiefcommercial and strategy officer, said: ldquoWe are really pleased to be relaunching even more of our flights from  July and starting to get customers away on their much-needed summer holidays.ldquoOf course, the safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew remains our highest priority.ldquoThis is why we have implemented a number of measures enhancing safety at each part of the journey from disinfecting the aircraft to requiring customers and crew to wear masks.What are easyJets rules for passengers These are the rules that travelers must follow:On-board measures:All passengersand crew will be required to wear masks onboard at all times.

This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

We know that the children being worst hit by this time out of school are those from the least privileged backgrounds.The council is working to try to get children back to school but the current government proposals are not acceptable.They aim for the majority of primary schools to have  per cent of pupils attending at any one time and some primary schools to have only  per cent of pupils attending at a time.In our high schools it is a similar story of, at best, having only  per cent of pupils attending at any one time.Part of the issue is that Scottish Government guidance on two-metre social distancing massively limits the number of children who can be in class at any one time.Of course, as we have seen this week, confusion exists in the government as to how education will be delivered in the long term any- way.John Swinney explained that the proposed blended learning arrangements are likely to last for most of the next academic year, only for Nicola Sturgeon to suggest these proposals are merely a contingency plan.This uncertainty creates many dficulties as we plan.For example, how do we get children to school from home The council currently provides transport to get children to schools but, as stands, it will not be sufficient and will need to be radically increased in scope.Council officers suggest that this could mean the cost ballooning to ldquoin excess of pound. million and therefore well beyond existing resource levels, in part due to the two-metre social distancing requirement.But, even with a smaller distance, there will still be signicant dficulty in our schools.We should look at utilising other public buildings such as community centres and sports halls for education purposes.However, this then comes to the crux of the matter: there are signicant resourcing issues with reopening schools.The Scottish Government has asked councils and schools to operate and act in new and radical ways but has not come forward in a meaningful way to assist them.The Scottish Government must help us fund the cost of transporting children to school and help to fund the opening up of other public buildings.Providing an education to our children here in East Lothian needs to be among our very highest priorities.That is why my Conservatives colleagues on the councilrsquos education committee, which is meeting this week, will be pushing officers to try to get children back in school sooner and quicker."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-east-linton-enjoys-stay-home-gala","story":"The gala committee were forced to cancel the annual day, due to take place on Saturday, June , but decided instead to hold a socially distant event instead.With the theme of Masquerade, locals decorated their homes and planned to have picnics in their gardens and wear masks.Sadly the rain meant most picnics were unable to go ahead but the local fire crew arrived and drove through the village streets handing out treats provided by the committee.Children were encouraged to draw pictures of a fire engine and put them on display at their homes to attract the firefighters attention and families turned out to wave to the crew with some some lucky youngsters even given the chance to climb into the fire engine cab.Station Commander David Ward, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: ldquoWe were delighted that members of our crew at East Linton Fire Station could take part in their community gala.\"With so many gala days and local events cancelled, itrsquos great to see people come together in this way to try and create something positive for the local community, and children especially.

, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised British nationals against all but essential international travel.Now, a number of short-haul flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.This is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad.What are air bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being trialled at Manchester Airport, in which passengers can reserve a free -minute window to use a dedicated lane taking

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  We   re all public health guinea pigs now    but that   s just the way it has to be","story":"Irsquove also started planning a wee holiday up north and have booked a hairdressersrsquo appointment.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Working towards \"elimination\" of the virus rather than attempting to balance health, economics and popularity, has also resulted in no recorded Covid- deaths in Scotland for four days in a row , which overall would suggest to most objective observers that the Scottish Government has done a \"reasonable job\" to date in handling dficult questions posed by this devastating pandemic.None of us know what lies ahead, but a little bit of humility on the parts of those who would have had the First Minister follow in ldquolock-step with a Prime Minister clearly struggling with the serious demands and responsibilities of attempting to manage a pandemic would at least be a positive contribution to constructive debate in Scotland.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.PLEASE allow me to present an alternative perspective on some of William Loneskiersquos alleged failings of the Scottish Government . To be clear, I am not a member of any political party.Those better qualied than me will comment on educational standards, but as far as reopening schools is concerned it is far too early to pass judgment. We are still several weeks away in a fast-changing situation which could still go either way fully open, blended learning or local lockdown. I expect that local authorities will continue to develop solutions for each scenario over the coming weeks.Some weeks ago the London School of Economics busted the myth that care home deaths pro rata have been higher in Scotland. Fundamental responsibility for barrier nursing and supplying PPE rested with the care home owners but we should be pleased the Scottish Government helped with supplying PPE and there have been ious other positive interventions by the NHS and Care Inspectorate. The actions that the Health Secretary has taken with the NHS boards responsible for the Queen Elizabeth University and Sick Children hospitals should be welcomed rather than condemned much has still to emerge about the delivery of the respective contracts and adherence to specication. We should also commend the setting up of a central unit that will give guidance on design and procurement as well as oversee construction of hospitals across the country in future.Similarly, while the contract for the provision of rail services has not met targets, the contract is being terminated at the next break point. Surely this, combined with the plan to allow a public sector bid, is a sound action and not a failing Mr Loneskiersquos mention of ldquobranding in Gaelic is nothing to do with the SNP or the current Scottish Government. Each public body in Scotland is required to have a Gaelic Plan under the Gaelic LanguageAct , which was introduced at the time of the Labour Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive.The NHS is not the only service that is potentially unsustainable in Scotland under the current allocation of funding in the UK and we could certainly do better. We need to start to realise that Scotland is a wealthy country and when trade, production, land, sea and air assets are allocated properly, Scotland is better resourced pro rata than rUK. We are the wealthy part of the UK and are capable of funding ourselves adequately, becoming similar to countries like Denmark, Finland and Slovakia, which exist quite happily with populations around the same as ours.These small countries donrsquot need big neighbours to let them play their full part in the world either for example only last week Norway and Ireland gained seats on the UN Security Council.John C Hutchison, Fort William.WELL, there we have it, after the Tory UK Government cry of \"get Brexit done\" the mantra now appears to be \"get Covid done\" and move on. This was confirmed by our cavalier PM that England was ending its \"long national hibernation\", with lockdown rapidly easing.This is against the advice of independent health professionals, at home and around the world, who warn of the \"real risk\" of a second wave of coronavirus. However, for the sake of all the peoples of the UK I fervently hope this will not happen.As a new kind of normality arises, the meaningless intransigence of Westminster should accept that a union, freely entered into by two sovereign nations, commands mutual respect with either member able to withdrawa majority of its people decide. With separate legal systems and with very dferent views on Europe and the world, it is now up to the people of Scotland, alone, to decide their destiny. This democratic right is growing in Scotland as polls to date have risen to more than  per cent for independence and with several strong mandates already in place for indyref, an independent Scotland is inevitable with or without the permission of London.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.FOR some time Scotland plc has been run by the marketing department, putting a kilt on everything including a Nightingale Hospital, culminating in the ridiculous plaid face mask sported by the CEO last week.In the meantime the operations departments of education, healthcare, tourism, social care and industry, have under-performed miserably when measured against the competition, yet curiously underspending every year.In the tough times ahead the shareholders of Scotland plc will demand a change of CEO and finance director and impose severe cuts to the banal marketing spend and replacement of all the department heads with people who know which way is up, because, for the first time in recorded history, you are not better off with the devil you know.John Dunlop, Ayr.I FOUND Sir Tom Hunters articleinspiring. This crisis has given us the perfect opportunity to start again. If business and government can agree to work together in a way that enables both sides to do what theyre good at and not let vested interests or petty jealousies get in the way, then everyone benefits. The Government itself would thus earn the respect of the whole nation as forward-looking and we truly could have a new Enlightenment.Ann Jopp, Glasgow G.SIR Tom Hunter must know that Nicola Sturgeon will never share the limelight with anyone nor will the SNP release its neo-communist grip on Scotland. Jim McColl got his fingers badly burned associating with the Scottish Government over the ferries project.

May I suggest the same approach be applied to education Maureen McGarry-OHanlon, Balloch.I READ Tom Gordons articlewith wry amusement. We have been at this juncture before, with the original Salmond inquiry, the Salmond trial and now the trial of the inquiry. At each point the doom of Nicola Sturgeon Alex Salmond was on the cards, and the destruction of the SNP was happily forecast by all the pundits in the Scottish media. There comes a point when wolf is cried too often.So I wonderMr Gordon and his fellow scribblers are too close to the touchlineto feel the reaction of the crowd. I look back at Damian Green, the effective ldquoDeputy Prime Minister of the entire UK, and the serious accusations which faced him. He is no longer a minister, but still a respected MP and a pundit the media often turn to for informed comment, a situation which could not be replicated in Scotland, where only the starkest black and white exist.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I AM surprised that David Rocheshould apparently sell his soul to the devil in order to gain independence for Scotland. I consider his suggestion that Labour voters should betray their cause and vote SNP in order to bring about a single-party independent state is as illogical as it is ill-timed.I believe thathe displays patience until the next UK General Election he will without any doubt see Sir Keir Starmer lead Labour to a majority by a landslide and go on to drain the swamp of Westminster.Many will agree with me that in a misguided and somewhat naiumlve effort to lead his party by consensus, Jeremy Corbyn effectively managed to design an unelectable Labour Party in the last General Election.Sir Keir now has a breathing space to reconstruct a focused, transparent and dependable UK-wide party.During the same period I anticipate Boris Johnson will continue his downward spiral of an incremental collapse in party confidence with growing public unease, suspicion and mistrust.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Read more: Sturgeon tells shoppers not to squander Covid- progress"},{"url":null,"title":"larry-flanagan-schools-return-cannot-business-usual-ambition-needed","story":"Worryingly, many parents will have witnessed the growing trauma of lockdown in their childrenrsquos demeanour, notwithstanding their own care and the effort of teachers and schools to provide support during the last  days.From a standing start, everyone had to adjust to a home learning model which very quickly exposed the impact of poverty on so many children faced with not only digital inequity but often an even more basic challenge of not having books, paper and pens.I know of many schools where teachers carried out weekly ldquodrop-offs of such materials, also allowing them to make contact with pupils who might otherwise ldquodisappear off the radar.:EIS union warns over support for severely traumatised pupils ing to school in AugustIf continued suppression of the virus allows us to move towards pupils being back in school full time come August, it should not be business as usual, because lockdown has sharply exposed deep fault lines which need to be repaired.Certainly schools will have to be Covid-secure to guard against local outbreaks or even a second wave of the virus, but beyond that they to focus on childrenrsquos wellbeing, their re-engagement with learning their need to be nurtured and supported and, crucially, the particular needs of those who have been most disadvantaged by school closure.

Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires.

The project has grown out of recent patterns whereby once remote destinations in the Arctic and northern European countries have become more accessible to tourists.The growth of the expedition cruise industry, cheaper accommodation and an increase in flights have all contributed to this trend. Visitors to these regions are often curious, drawn to less-visited parts of the world to experience and learn about somewhere that is off the beaten track.Now places like the isle of Arran and Assynt in Wester Ross could become international destinations alongside Iceland and Lapland with tourists keen to learn about science of a local area.Project manager Ari Laakso from the University of Lapland said ldquoTravellers want to understand and learn about what they see and experience. Often, tourists will visit a museum, a science centre or a culturally interesting venue to learn more about natural phenomena, but why not take this a step further  This new tourism concept would focus on utilising and communicating science in a fun and hands-on fashion, exploring a certain topic or place.ldquoScientists have always travelled to remote places for study and research.

What we have found is concerning ndashthe market power of these firms goes unchecked, people and businesses will lose out.\"People will carry on handing over more of their personal data than necessary, a lack of competition could mean higher prices for goods and services bought online and we could all miss out on the benefits of the next innovative digital .\"Our clear recommendation to government is that a new pro-competitive regulatory regime be established to address the concerns we have identied and regulate a sector which is central to all our lives.\"The CMA say that Google and Facebooks large user base is a source of \"market power\".It means that Facebook is a ldquomust-have network for users to remain in contact with each other, and enables Google to train its search algorithms in ways that other search engines cannot.\"Each has unmatchable access to user data, allowing them to target advertisements to inidual consumers and tailor the services they provide,\" the regulator said.\"Both use default settings to nudge people into using their services and giving up their data.\"It said Google paid around pound.bn in  to be the default search provider on mobile devices and browsers in the UK, while Facebook requires people to accept personalised advertising as a condition for using their service.But the regulator added: \"Their presence across many dferent markets, partially acquired through many acquisitions over the years, also makes it harder for rivals to compete.\"These issues matter to consumers. Weak competition in search and social media leads to reduced innovation and choice, as well as to consumers giving up more data than they would like.\"Further,the poundbn spend in the UK last year on digital advertising is higher than it would be in a more competitive market, this will be felt in the prices for hotels, flights, consumer electronics, books, insurance and many other products that make heavy use of digital advertising. The CMA found that Googlersquos prices are around % to % higher than Bing when comparing like-for-like search terms on desktop and mobile.\"It said that Google and Facebookrsquos market positions also have a profound impact on newspapers and other publishers.The CMA found that newspapers are reliant on Google and Facebook for almost % of all visits to their sites.\"This dependency potentially squeezes their share of digital advertising revenues, undermining their ability to produce valuable content,\" it said.The CMA has proposed that within the new regime a Digital Markets Unit should have the ability to enforce a code of conduct to ensure that s with a position of market power, like Google and Facebook, do not engage in \"exploitative or exclusionary practices\" or in a manner likely to reduce trust and transparency, and to impose finesnecessary.It wants powers to restrict Googlersquos ability to secure its place as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers in order to introduce more choice for users.The unit should also have powers to insist Facebook give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising.It wants Google to be ordered open up its click and query data to rival search engines to allow them to improve their algorithms so they can properly compete.\"This would be designed in a way that does not involve the transfer of personal data to avoid privacy concerns,\" it said.And it said there should be teeth to insist Facebook increase its \"interoperability\" with competing social media s.The unit would also oversee a ldquofairness-by-design duty on the s to ensure that they are making it \"as easy as possible for users to make meaningful choices\".And it could order the separation of s where necessary to ensure healthy competition.Whilst the recommedations recommendation are UK-focused, many of the problems that the CMA identied were international in nature.So the CMA said it will therefore continue to take a leading role globally in relation to these issues as part of a wider digital strategy."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amA new £. million early learning and childcare facility is to be built at Orkney College by Orkney Islands Council.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could.

We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skye-golf-club-sconser.jpg","title":"green for go competitions off and running again at the isle of skye golf","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSomewhat belatedly the competitions have commenced and it was to the ladies section that the honour of opening the season belonged.On a recent blustery Sunday a quartet of quines graced the fairways at Sconser and Sandi Beatson emerged from the pack to steal the headlines on day one.Playing off her #mark# of  two steady halves of  and  saw her record an opening day handicap-reducing gross score of  and an immediate #cut# from  to  so very well played and what a great start to her golfing season.Proxime accessit was Donalda Johnston with a gross score of  in this the first of five rounds to be played for the Ladies Championship.Incidentally in this same competition last year Sandi also recorded a victorious, handicap-reducing score of three under the Competitions Scratch Score* for the day. This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

It would make much more sense not to go ahead, said Dr Holohan.The development comes as the Government prepares to unveil its first stage of #air bridges# - a number of short-haul European destinations which will not require UK holidaymakers to quarantine.The move has been hailed as giving the travel industry - which has suffered greatly due to the pandemic - a vital boost.However, Dr Scally told the Belfastyesterday the public should give foreign travel a miss this year - a plea which has been described by travel operators here as soul-destroying as demand in holiday bookings s.My personal view is that we should take a holiday from having foreign holidays, he said.There shouldn#t be any holiday trips outside the island of Ireland this year.The basic principle is that we shouldn#t be flying off to the sun for a couple of reasons. I don#t think it is safe to go holiday tourist hotspots becausethere are going to be flare-ups of the virus abroad, the likelihood is that those holiday hotspots will be prime candidates and people may get the virus and bring it back with them.Dr Scally continued: The risks coming back are importing cases into Ireland where - north and south - the number of cases are extremely small.And the best way of keeping them extremely low - in fact getting rid of them entirely, I believe - is that there should be a zero-Covid island.The risk of people importing new cases is that they can spread quite rapidly through the community and travelling through airports and public transport.Dr Scally said that the Executive should follow the footsteps of the Republic and issue the same no foreign holiday plea.I think the Executive should consider the matter and come out with a very clear statement and work very closely with the new government in the Republic, and take an agreed position on the matter, he said.It should be something we have in common, that just for this year, it#s a stay at home year, and enjoy your own country.In response, Health Minister Robin Swann has urged the public to take precautionsthey do make the decision to go on a foreign holiday.Clearly there is a risk in travelling to countries where the virus is still very much circulating, he said. I would urge the public to take all necessary precautions to reduce their chance of becoming infected, including following governmental advice for travellers as well as adhering to good hand and respiratory hygiene, keep to the social distance guidelines and follow the guidance in relation to the use of face coverings.Dr Scally also said that people staying at home would give the economy a boost on both sides of the border.It would be betterthe pounds and the euros on the island of Ireland were spent on tourism in the island of Ireland, he said. And that would help local businesses to recover and keep people employed and restore the economy.Heather Fielding, managing director of Gallagher Travel, said customers# #wanderlust# is now ing.The demand for travel is here, even though restrictions may be in place, she said.We#ve noticed a real increase in demand for the remainder of this summer, and we#ve had key workers working non-stop and they#re ready for a holiday away. People now want to getaway. Some people are postponing trips, but we#re definitely seeing that demand coming back.Ms Fielding said that a message urging people not to go abroad now would be coming at the wrong time for the industry, although she stressed public health remains the priority.It#s soul destroying. We#re in a kind of no man#s land and we#re taking a day at the time as an industry, she added. The managing director also stressed there are definitely deals to be had for customers.Meanwhile, Naomi Waite, director of marketing at Tourism NI said there is plenty of choice for those who are opting to have a staycation at home.Whether it#s revisiting childhood holiday destinations with your own family or awakening your sense of adventure, there will be a giant welcome for visitors this summer, she said.

The Very Rev David Monteith, from Enniskillen, said he wanted to offer a message of support to those now facing added weeks of uncertainty.He also called on the government not to forget the most vulnerable, with many of those testing positive for the virus in Leicester coming from low income and BAMEbackgrounds. The first localised lockdown in the UK was announced after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around % of all positive cases in England were detected there over the last week.Non-essential shops have closed and schools will follow for at least two weeks for the city centre and some suburbs, with citizens advised not to make unnecessary journeys.Rev Monteith said he is now uncertain about when he canto Enniskillen to visit his parents, or when Leicester Cathedral can reopen.It#s quite sombre here, people are quite stunned, he told the Belfast .The city is quieter today but clearly not everyone has got the message so it#s not quite back to how it was in March or April.He noted how coronavirus death figures in Leicester during the worst parts of the pandemic were lower than expected, adding: Hospitals were pretty much managing to keep on top of things so this suddenly coming into the public arena has really surprised people.Places of worship in England were allowed to open for private prayer earlier this month, with full worship supposed to follow on July . In a very multicultural city like Leicester, that includes mosques, temples, churches and synagogues, he said. Private prayer has worked for some traditions, but in mosques you#re supposed to pray in public.This weekend many faith communities, including the Christian community, would have been able to have a much more normal sense of worship.The cathedral is now closed until further notice, and funerals will again have to be held outside with limited numbers.It sits at the burial site of Richard III, and just this week a large group of tourists had been welcomed inside. This was the first timethat any of us have been in a room with  or more people and there was a real delight and joy about it evenyou couldn#t shake hands or hug, Rev Monteith said.Initially lockdown was a big shock for us. We#ve been doing online weekly services and sometimes we get very signicant numbers of people, far more than would ever come to church. But there#s something about physical presence which is still important even though online offers new possibilities.Somehow we#re going to have to work with both of these realities moving forward.Offering hope to those dreading the latest restrictions, he said: I think I#ve noticed that this whole process has affected people very dferently. Some have found the space and the clear air to have been a delight, while other people have struggled incredibly.But the human spirit is incredibly resilient and hope has not died at all. If anything in Leicester we#ve learned over the years that hope is a gt that comes from community.That#s been my experience over the years,I find myself locked away in a dark place, often the way to get out of it is to break out and reach out.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to spend billions on infrastructure projects, Rev Monteith said those in need must be included.A lot of the people who are being tested positive in Leicester come from BAME backgrounds, and people living in poverty and working in very low paid jobs.We#ve seen a way in which we as a society have revalued care workers who are also not paid very much. I suppose moving forward, in thinking about the type of society we want to try and create, I think church and faith leaders are up for playing their part in creating a much more equitable society.On Tuesday Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester.The Health Secretary said that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus. He added that the decision to shut the city#s schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.

If they are all table service, that should alleviate any problems.It#s really important that government gives us a date. Regrettably, I do think this virus, and therefore social distancing, will be here for a very long time. We need government to help those businesses which just physically cannot reopen.Speaking on the Ulster Business Podcast, Janice Gault, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said while everyone is looking forward to coming back, there is a little bit of nervousness around it.We have discovered that people miss the type of product we provide, she said.But many spots, even those which are technically able to open their doors to serve food, will not open this weekend.The days of the shoulder-to-shoulder pub and back-to-back restaurant will not be with us for a while, Mr Neill says.There will be a responsibility on customers, businesses and staff to do everything to stop the spread of this virus.Mr Rana, whose company owns hotels such as The Crowne Plaza and Ibis in Belfast, said while the core of hotels won#t have changed, customers will start noticing dferences.Hotels are about hospitality ... the fundamentals won#t change. There will be more distance between yourself and fellow diners, but the real work is behind the scenes, he said. In our four star hotels, breakfast will be largely served. The buffet is a touch point we are trying to avoid.In the mid-market and budget hotels there will be a range of #to go# options, just presented in a dferent manner.Ms Gault says while businesses are now keen to bring staff back to work, getting through to March next year is going to be a challenge.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in year#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#PSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulationsParades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

The move was backed by the DUP, Sinn Fein and the SDLP, while the UUP, Alliance, Greens and People Before Profit gave their support to an amendment from TUV leader Jim Allister.The North Antrim MLA proposed that an independent body be given the role of setting future allowances, subject to Assembly Commission guidance.However, Mr Allister#s proposal was rejected by a vote of  to , with one abstention.He said he feared that those behind the proposal had failed to learn from previous abuses of the expenses system.Those who tabled the motion must have short memories. I do not think that the public have, added the TUV leader. The public well remember that when the system that is proposed in the motion was in operation - namely, that MLAs controlled, through the commission, their own expenses - it was abused and the product was scandal.Alan McQuillan was part of the  in an independent review which previously determined the salaries, expenses and pensions paid to MLAs.He said: This decision takes them back  years. They will be the only legislative body in the UK or Ireland doing this.My fear is that, give it two or three years and we will find ourselves in the original situation, causing serious damage to the reputation of the Assembly.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who put forward the allowances proposal, said the current rules failed to recognise economic realities facing MLAs.The motion will enable the Assembly Commission to ensure that members can legitimately purchase basic items to help them to deliver services to our constituents, that an MLA#s contact details can be promoted on the constituency office, and, most notably, to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff who work in our offices are fair and reasonable, he added.Sinn Fein#s John O#Dowd argued that the TUV amendment would cause further delays to expenses reforms.Mr O#Dowd said: Go back to your staff in your constituency offices, or some of your staff may be sitting in offices in this building. Sit down in front of them, look them in the eye and say, #I had the opportunity to correct a wrong, but I backed an amendment in the full knowledge that it would fail#.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in year#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#PSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulationsParades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the CCNI stressed that charities could continue to operate as previously without any disruption to their operations.The watchdog added: Furthermore, the commission will be contacting as many charity funders and support bodies as possible in order to clary the situation and request that this issue be taken into consideration when assessing applications from charities.A solution is being sought from the Department for Communitiesin order to permanently resolve the issue regarding decisions. Further information and guidance will be provided on the commission#s website.The DfC assured the charities affected that they remain charities in law and need do nothing dferently in the interim.It added that Caral Ni Chuilin, who is acting as Communities Minister in the absence of Deirdre Hargey, would shortly outline how the department intends to respond to the issues raised by the court judgment.The department is assured that the Charity Commission has introduced interim procedures to ensure decisions can be taken in compliance with the judgment, a spokesman said.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in year#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#PSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulationsParades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marches,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast .

If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

This is dferent.He told the congregation that Mr Storey was raised during a time when communities were under threat and the Army were constantly patrolling the streets... ultimately the family were intimidated from their home and spent several days sheltering in Girdwood Army Barracks.Mr Storey would later rise in the republican ranks, becoming the IRA#s director of intelligence and the northern chairman of Sinn Fein. He spent many years in jail for ious offences, played a key role in the mass IRA breakout from the Maze Prison in  and was widely regarded as one of the most feared and formidable members of the republican organisation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe late Bobby StoreyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe late Bobby StoreyHe is also credited with having played a prominent role in the peace process.Fr Donegan said that, having worked as a confessor for the past  years, he thanks God for not being confined to the limitations of human compassion and mercy.Often the biggest task of a confessor is to convince people to follow God#s example and to forgive themselves, he told the congregation.Reflecting on Mr Storey#s le, Fr Donegan described him as a devoted partner to Teresa with a gt of humour extended to all he met.The priest recalled how Mr Storey#s -year relationship with Teresa began to develop from the time of Bobby#s first parole in  and how his partner spoke of Bobby the family man and the great love he had for sister Geraldine and brothers Seamus and Brian.She told us of the great mutual love shared between Bobby and her sons Emmett, Fergal and Sean, he continued.The priest added that Bobby Storey will be fondly remembered by those who knew him.Ironically, his funeral may be remembered more by those who did not.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
