That evening, Epstein was filmed leaving the mansion with an unidentified woman, as newly-released stills, far right, show.They were spotted laughing and kissing as they walked away.While there is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the Duke, the fact he was drawn into Epstein’s toxic world and spent nearly a week in his company will surely raise further questions about his judgment and the statement he released yesterday.The December 2 dinner was held in the mansion’s second-floor dining room. TV anchor Katie Couric, once the highest-paid female presenter in the US, sat alongside comedian Chelsea Handler, a close friend of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston. Also there was George Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton turned £15 million-a-year ABC News host.The soiree is believed to have also been attended by Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the disgraced media tycoon Robert Maxwell and Epstein’s one-time girlfriend.Multiple Epstein accusers have claimed that Ms Maxwell ‘procured’ girls for the perverted millionaire. She denies the allegations.Guests would have walked past bizarre erotic artwork en route to the dining room with its gleaming mahogany table, including a painting of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, a reference to the outfit worn by Monica Lewinsky when she performed a sex act on him.         Jeffrey Epstein and unidentified lady left his Upper East Side mansion, variously dubbed the House of Horror and the House of Depravity by the banker’s young victimsIn an interview published on Friday in the US political magazine Mother Jones, Epstein’s friend Stuart Pivar, a respected scientist, told how the financier loved to shock at his parties. Mr Pivar described one dinner party to which Epstein had invited a group of top scientists. ‘Jeffrey had no attention  whatsoever, he would interrupt the conversation and say things like, “What does that got to do with p***y?” That was his favorite expression. It was a subject changer.’Whether Andrew heard Epstein utter those crass words remains unknown but the Prince, albeit unwittingly, was undoubtedly a ‘draw’ in New York where ‘you can buy anything except the caché of Royalty’, according to one woman who attended an Epstein party.The socialite told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘There’s nothing socially mobile Manhattanites love more than brushing shoulders with a genuine member of the Royal Family. ‘Diana was a superstar. Prince Charles can command tens of thousands of dollars for tickets to a dinner. Jeffrey knew exactly what he was doing.‘Who is going to turn down the chance to mingle with a real-life Prince at dinner, even if the guy hosting it has a conviction for something as terrible as child molestation?         The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay‘Royalty is stardust. People held their noses after Jeffrey was convicted but they were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with Royalty.’The Prince has fiercely denied any wrongdoing and knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, but he has faced questions about how he could have missed a procession of beautiful young women visiting the mansion during his six-day stay.‘There were girls coming and going the entire time Prince Andrew was inside the house,’ an eyewitness said.‘It was happening in broad daylight. If the Prince didn’t see all the girls coming through that door, he was the only person on 71st Street who didn’t. It was flagrant.‘At one point someone who looked like a royal protection officer came outside. Even if Andrew didn’t realise what was going on, you have to wonder why the people assigned to protect him didn’t say something?’Many of Epstein’s victims have described how assaults took place in an upstairs massage room which was strictly off-limits to other house guests.Some reports this week claimed Prince Andrew is now ‘fearful’ of returning to the US because he worries about being dragged into one of the multiple civil lawsuits being brought against Epstein’s £500 million estate. Lawyer Bradley Edwards, who represents several of the victims, said last night: ‘We would welcome the chance to speak to Prince Andrew under oath.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Elton John set feature new set stamps mark 50 years showbiz","story":"Share this article               It is understood there will be a set of four stamps, each charting a different phase of his career (pictured: A Mail on Sunday interpretation of how the stamps commemorating Sir Elton’s career could look)A source said: ‘To Elton, this is the most tremendous honour.

He thinks thieves took advantage of the fact that he was away and took his car in the early hours of Monday, August 19Mr Ilyas previously said: \u0027Whoever did it must have seen that I was going on holiday on social media and through that it was the right moment to steal it.\u0027He flew out on Thursday for a week, but on Monday morning he received a text message from his mum saying that his car was gone.Mr Ilyas, who has a large following on Instagram, said: \u0027Obviously I thought that it had been stolen. When I found out I had to change my ticket as soon as possible and fly back.\u0027He flew back on the Tuesday and began to investigate, putting out appeals on social media too.         The car now safely in a garage after having the message daubed on the bonnetMr Ilyas, who runs a social media agency called Blu Capital Education, said: \u0027We had a look around to see if it was caught on camera but so far we\u0027ve not been able to find anything.\u0027It\u0027s a convertible BMW M4. I bought it for the summer and I\u0027ve only had it for three months.\u0027Mr Ilyas is devastated by the theft.He said: \u0027Things like this are rare in Derby. I want to raise some awareness on social media. So far we have had nothing concrete back about it.\u0027People have seen a car that looks just like it without the number plate and things, but nothing firm as of yet.\u0027If someone saw something it would be great if they came forward.

Travel said: “It is unacceptable for passengers to be regularly inconvenienced with delays that can leave them hundreds of pounds out of pocket when they miss connections or transfers, are fined for picking up their hire car late or miss their train or cab home.”In a robust response, Ryanair rejected the findings. In a statement, it said: “These Which? figures are inflated and inaccurate. They refer to 2018, which was the worst year on record for ATC delays in Europe.”EasyJet and Thomas Cook both claimed factors beyond their control were to blame for the delays, such as airspace, weather and strikes.Stansted said it had posted significantly improved results in the first quarter of 2019, in part because Ryanair had invested in additional resourcing and equipment to support ground operation.While delays at British Airways improved over the five-year period, over the weekend furious customers attacked the airline for its handling of the pilots’ strike planned for September.Customers swamped BA helplines, and many passengers reported calling every hour but never getting through. Others messaged the company on Twitter with their frustrations, some complaining they would miss weddings and honeymoons.Scott Kishere, a filmmaker and police community officer, said: “My wife and I have been told that our flight to Toronto has been cancelled. This was a full package we booked through BA for our 10-year wedding anniversary. I have made over 100 attempts to contact them for a refund and they’re not answering.”BA said it was receiving nine times its normal call volumes and that 500 staff worked over the weekend to help sort out customer issues. But the airline admitted to adding to the chaos, after it sent some customers an email to say their flight had been cancelled, even though the flight was on a non-strike day and was scheduled to go ahead.After it realised the error, BA emailed customers again but by that time many had rebooked with other airlines.In a statement, it said: “We are sorry for any confusion and inconvenience this has caused. We would encourage anyone who has incurred any expenses as a direct result to get in touch, and we will deal with each case on an inidual basis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67cd7acb06d872fbe907571036e18de2b79c8ff/0_627_4888_2933/master/4888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e3e3f2bb0892cef1680c677d45d6291","title":"nestle suwannee river ginnie springs plan permit","story":"Opponents fighting to stop the project say the fragile river cannot sustain such a large drawThe crystal blue waters of Ginnie Springs have long been treasured among the string of pearls that line Florida’s picturesque Santa Fe River, a playground for water sports enthusiasts and an ecologically critical haven for the numerous species of turtles that nest on its banks.Soon, however, it is feared there could be substantially less water flowing through, if a plan by the food and beverage giant Nestlé wins approval.In a controversial move that has outraged environmentalists and also raised questions with authorities responsible for the health and vitality of the river, the company is seeking permission to take more than 1.1m gallons a day from the natural springs to sell back to the public as bottled water.Opponents say the fragile river, which is already officially deemed to be “in recovery” by the Suwannee River water management district after years of earlier overpumping, cannot sustain such a large draw – a claim Nestlé vehemently denies. Critics are fighting to stop the project as environmentally harmful and against the public interest.Meanwhile, Nestlé, which produces its popular Zephyrhills and Pure Life brands with water extracted from similar natural springs in Florida, has spent millions of dollars this year buying and upgrading a water bottling plant at nearby High Springs in expectation of permission being granted.The company needs the Suwannee River water management district to renew an expired water use permit held by a local company, Seven Springs, from which it plans to buy the water at undisclosed cost. Nestlé insists spring water is a rapidly renewable resource and promises a “robust” management plan in partnership with its local agents for long-term sustainability of its water sources.Yet company officials concede in letters to water managers supporting the permit request that its plans would result in four times more water being taken daily than Seven Springs’ previously recorded high of 0.26m gallons for its customers before Nestlé.“The facility is in process of adding bottling capacity and expects significant increase in production volumes equal to the requested annual average daily withdrawal volume of approximately 1.152m gallons,” George Ring, natural resources manager for Nestlé Waters North America, wrote in a June letter to the Suwannee district engineers.Campaigners against Nestlé’s plan, who have set up an online forum and petition and submitted dozens of letters of opposition ahead of a decision that could come as early as November, say that environmental grounds alone should be enough to disqualify the plan.“The question is how much harm is it going to cause the spring, what kind of change is going to be made in that water system?” said Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson, a director of the not-for-profit Our Santa Fe River.“It’s impossible to withdraw millions of gallons of water and not have an impact. If you take any amount of water out of a glass you will always have less.”Additionally, Malwitz-Jipson said, the Santa Fe River and its associated spring habitats are home to 11 native turtle species and four non-native species, which rely on a vigorous water flow and river levels.“Few places on Earth have as many turtle species living together and about a quarter of all North American freshwater turtle species inhabit this small river system. A big threat to this ersity is habitat degradation, which will happen with reduced flows.”Stefani Weeks, program engineer with the Suwannee River water management district, said that because Seven Springs was seeking a five-year renewal of an existing permit instead of making a new application. Board members could not consider in their final decision the Santa Fe River’s protected designation and a recovery strategy implemented in 2014 to restore reduced water flows and levels.But the district has its own questions, and wrote to Seven Springs in July for a second time to request answers. “Their first response we didn’t feel was complete, so we asked for them to go into more detail,” she said. “Once they respond we will review that information.”Among the items the district wants are an evaluation report of any harm that the project might cause to wetlands, and a documented impact study of Ginnie Springs. The permit cannot be granted, the district says, unless Seven Springs can show that there would be no change in “water levels or flows of the source spring from the normal rate and range of function” and “no adverse impacts to water quality, vegetation or animal population”.Nestlé is no stranger to controversy over its water extraction activities. In 2017, the state water resources control board of California issued a report of investigation concluding that the company appeared to be erting water “without a valid basis of right” from Strawberry Canyon in the San Bernardino national forest for use in its Arrowhead brand of bottled water.Nestlé continues to dispute the finding and is still pumping water there – 45m gallons last year, according to published reports. But in the tussle over whether the company had historic rights to all the water it was taking from the creek, groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the Save Our Forest Association were critical of Nestlé and its operations.In a written statement Nestlé, which employs 800 people in Florida, said it wanted to address “misconceptions” about its plans.“We adhere to all relevant regulatory and state standards. Just like all the previous owners of the High Springs factory which manufactured bottled water and other beverages, we are not taking water from a publicly owned source. Instead we are buying water from a private company which holds the valid water use permit,” spokesman Adam Gaber said, adding that Nestlé’s water use “will always remain strictly within the limit set by the permit”.He said that Nestlé was also a responsible steward of the environment. “Our business depends on the quality and sustainability of the water we are collecting,” he said.“It would make no sense to invest millions of dollars into local operations just to deplete the natural resources on which our business relies. It would undermine the success of our business and go against every value we hold as people and as a company.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51248033ef9fda8f96365dc8925fe677a7a13881/0_249_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b76a52e1d49997be505addabc570616","title":"very wretched indeed horrible historical reviews of scottish cities a quiz","story":"Ever wondered what Tripadvisor would have been like 200 years ago?

If his earlier work – shouty, heavy metal standup veering between bombast and self-pity – never directly addressed Helm’s depression, Phoenix from the Flames makes its subject explicit. It finds the 38-year-old being more emotionally honest and unequivocally himself than ever before.But not more funny. It’s as if Helm has made a decision to prioritise authenticity over comedy, in service of his stated belief that we need to be talking more publicly about mental health. There are substantial sections of the show where the laughs are few and distantly separated, as the Uncle star describes his bad days, months or years – struggling to get out of bed, to look at himself in the mirror, to engage with life. The stories illustrating this do have punchlines. But – as with the tale of a not-quite-romantic encounter on the Southbank – they’re not always funny enough, or they are too bleak or brutish to justify the long wait. Not for the first time, Helm’s show is redeemed by his songs – rasping rock performances heavy on comic braggadocio. The title number, to which Helm enters in a cape and skimpy Lycra shorts, deploys dense and daft rhyming to herald our indomitable host’s return to the frontline. A later number memorably pairs cock rock stylings with a lyric about antidepressants rendering Helm unable to ejaculate.This stuff is precious, and so too the material on Helm doing his bit for Comic Relief, at the cost of his own dignity and self-esteem. It’s the routine that best synthesises humour and emotional intimacy, as a surprise call to the charity telephone line helps him reckon with his demons. The laughs may be fitful, but Helm’s directness is disarming in this bracingly stark and vulnerable show.• At Redgrave theatre, Bristol, on 27 September, then touring.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews.

It makes no sense for councils to be given the responsibility to plan for school places but then not be allowed to open schools themselves,” Bramble said.“The government needs to work closely with councils to meet the challenges currently facing the education system.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education (DfE) said: “We are determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created around 920,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.As parents and families prepare to apply for school places in 2020 when applications open later this year, the LGA says the DfE’s statistics suggest 15 areas have a shortage of classrooms, with the number of councils affected then rapidly increasing.By 2022, about a third of councils are expected to have a shortage of places for nearly 60,000 pupils. That figure rises to nearly half of all local authorities in England by the school year starting in September 2024, when more than 120,000 young people are “at risk of no place” if no new schools are built.In recent years, councils have created an estimated 600,000 places in primary schools to cope with the mini baby boom of the previous decade. But as children in that group move on to secondary school, councils say they have far less ability to provide more places.Last year, councils say, they created 96,000 places through their existing primary and secondary schools and, in a small number of cases, by commissioning places in academies. But only 37,000 of the new places were in secondary schools.The LGA’s plea comes as the government is reviving plans to rapidly expand the proportion of academies and free schools in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d20f6db7f660587056347febea5ca4d36899315b/0_97_4932_2960/master/4932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15f9ae0baf84f24622b6efe91f4d501d","title":"harvey weinstein new  indictment annabella sciorra","story":"Prosecutors to likely ask for Sciorra’s testimony to be included rather than add additional charge, which could delay proceedingsHarvey Weinstein will head back to court in New York on Monday morning, to be arraigned on a new indictment involving the actor Annabella Sciorra.The indictment has not been publicly disclosed. It is not clear if the movie mogul will face additional charges.Weinstein has already been charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of first-degree rape and one count of third-degree rape.With the start of his trial less than three weeks away, it is likely that rather than add an additional charge, which could delay proceedings, prosecutors will ask for Sciorra’s testimony to be included, in attempt to establish a pattern of criminal behaviour.Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all charges, maintaining that encounters with his accusers were consensual. If found guilty, the 67-year-old could spend the rest of his life in jail.Last week, lawyers for Weinstein described the arraignment as “unprecedented”.“There has been no case in recent memory where a district attorney has gone back to the grand jury on two separate occasions to re-present a case before that body in the hopes of obtaining an indictment that can withstand the scrutiny of a trial jury,” attorneys Donna Rotunno and Arthur Aidala said in a statement.The lawyers claimed the “action by the prosecutor bespeaks the desperation that has engulfed their case” and indicated “more of a focus on obtaining a conviction at all costs than on seeking justice”.More than 80 women have alleged sexual misconduct on the part of the producer, over four decades.Prosecutors first charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting three women. Charges relating to the actor Lucia Evans were dropped over inconsistencies in her testimony raised by the defense.Evans alleged that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during a meeting in 2004. But according to public records, a witness told police Evans had said her sexual encounter with Weinstein was consensual.Among the alleged encounters that remain attached to the case, Mimi Haleyi claims Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006. The other accuser, who has not been identified, has accused Weinstein of twice raping her in 2013.Weinstein’s lawyers claim the woman maintained communications with Weinstein after the alleged encounter, describing “a consensual intimate relationship documented in more than 400 emails”.Earlier this year, prosecutors amended their evidence to add Sciorra. She has publicly accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her at her Gramercy Park apartment in 1993.Judge James Burke first said Sciorra could not be added to the case because she had not been before a grand jury. Prosecutors convened another such panel this month, resulting in the indictment.Weinstein’s defense team is seeking to have the trial moved from Manhattan.In a court filing last week, attorneys said: “It is safe to say that New York City is the least likely place on earth where Mr Weinstein could receive a fair trial, where jurors could hear evidence, deliberate, and render a verdict in an atmosphere free of intimidation from pressure to deliver a result that the politicians, the activists, the celebrities and the media demand.”Judge Burke has yet to rule on the request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edbefe5c84078c5137770c1ee4afaf7a1ab0615/0_1560_5769_3460/master/5769.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=075ba98267057177cfc2a967af0b882f","title":"premier league 10 talking points football weekend action","story":"Cahill shows his worth to Palace, Lacazette proves Emery’s odd one out again and Wilson could be the signing of the seasonIt will not end the culture war between Newcastle fans and Mike Ashley, but victory at the Tottenham Stadium might just lift a few suspicions over Steve Bruce. In the first half, Newcastle were the team with greater vigour, and Joelinton’s finish for his goal followed a fine pass from Christian Atsu. Bruce does not enjoy comparisons with Rafa Benítez, but players such as Atsu, Miguel Almirón and Sean Longstaff might just be allowed greater freedom to express themselves under his supervision than they were within the Spaniard’s rigid tactics. Having taken the lead, plenty of last-ditch defending was required – not a long-term strategy for progress in the Premier League – but Newcastle did look organised. And beating the team Ashley grew up supporting was sweet for Bruce and his fellow Geordies. John BrewinIt takes more than a late positional switch to faze Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder was supposed to play behind Tammy Abraham in the 3-2 win at Norwich on Saturday but Frank Lampard had to shift him to the left when Pedro Rodríguez injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Mount’s response was to play a part in Abraham’s first goal and he later scored for the second time in two games, boosting his chances of an England call in the near future. “I think he can go to the top,” Lampard said. “He’s not a boy who wants the razzmatazz of it all, he just wants to be a top player for Chelsea and England. The confidence he has helps. I said to him five minutes before we went out that you’ll have to play on the left wing and come inside. It was no bother. He just took it on board and made all the right moves.” Jacob SteinbergFrustration was written all over Marco Silva’s face. There was frustration with the result at Aston Villa and frustration with the way their opponents defended. “We controlled all the second half, it’s not easy to play against a team with nine players around their box,” the Everton manager said a little unfairly. Deep down, Silva must have been frustrated with his players too. André Gomes was poor, Gylfi Sigurdsson a substitution waiting to happen and Richarlison peripheral – that is £100m worth of talent. The list could go on. It was not until the introduction of Alex Iwobi and Moise Kean that Everton started to attack with any conviction. Iwobi hit an upright and Kean set up a wonderful chance for Theo Walcott. While both those new signings will surely start against Wolves on Sunday, Everton need some of their other big names to come to the party. Stuart JamesEddie Howe had to act quickly on the eve of the season when David Brooks was ruled out for around three months with an ankle injury but the loan signing of Harry Wilson from Liverpool already looks to have been a masterstroke. The Welshman’s unstoppable free-kick against Manchester City after he came off the bench to replace the injured Charlie Daniels briefly raised hopes of ending Bournemouth’s awful record against the champions before Sergio Agüero settled matters on the south coast. Wilson has made a name for himself by scoring spectacular goals – no player in England’s four professional isions has managed more from outside the penalty area since the start of last season, when he was on loan at Derby – and Howe admitted he will be expecting a few more before he returns to Anfield. “I think Harry will probably want the next one,” he said. “It’s good to see – I don’t think we’ve scored that many in the past.” Ed AaronsWere it not for Florin Andone’s rush of blood, Southampton might have been joining Watford in early‑season crisis-club nil-point status. Andone looked as dumbfounded as anyone after the high-stepping hack on Yan Valery that was the most obvious of red cards. “It didn’t look like a great tackle,” Graham Potter said, embracing understatement. There were also Saintly sighs of relief when Lewis Dunk had a towering header chalked off by VAR. And Jürgen Locadia struck a post late on when Southampton were only a goal up, through Moussa Djenepo’s excellent strike. Victory did not alter the grim‑faced expression Ralf Hasenhüttl has worn through his team’s slow start, which has included defeats by Burnley and Liverpool. “It’s clear that we must do it much better,” he said. “It was too hectic.” JBAlexandre Lacazette could be forgiven for dreading August. Since his arrival in 2017, Arsenal have played four league games against big-six opponents in the opening month. Lacazette has begun all on the bench. Two years ago, he was the odd man out when Danny Welbeck, Alexis Sánchez and Mesut Özil were selected ahead of him at Anfield. Twelve months ago, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Özil were preferred against Manchester City and Chelsea. Even his status as Arsenal’s reigning player of the year did not save Lacazette oOn Saturday Aubameyang was instead joined in attack by the full debutant Nicolas Pépé. While the £72m signing showed his pace and threat to offer encouragement and Lacazette should complete a front three who could torment lesser opponents, the Frenchman may wonder why he always seems to have a point to prove to his managers when it comes to selection for the marquee matches. Richard JollyGary Cahill enjoyed the best of debuts as Crystal Palace beat Manchester United at Old Trafford in the league for the first time in 30 years. A 33-year-old who has 61 caps for England signed on a free from Chelsea may turn out to be the bargain of the summer. And though Cahill – understandably – struggled with the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, he was integral to a proud result. “There are going to be a lot more games in this league where you have more possession,” he said. “It wasn’t going to be one of them here. We dropped into a shape and worked very hard in it. We managed the game well in difficult moments and showed great desire. We showed that determination and it would have been easy to crumble at 1-1. To hit them on the break was great. We knew it was going to be difficult coming here.” Jamie JacksonHave West Ham finally found themselves a top-level centre‑forward for the long term? You would hope so, given Sébastien Haller set them back £45m, and the signs were promising in Saturday’s helter-skelter match at Watford. Even if Haller looked rusty when failing to get a shot off in the buildup to Mark Noble’s early penalty, he was a menacing presence around the box for the rest of the afternoon and was in the right place when it mattered to score the decisive goals. The 6ft 3in Haller shares certain similarities with Andy Carroll but is five years younger and, should he stay fit, could easily prove the spearhead West Ham hoped the England striker would be. On this evidence he will have plenty of chances to finish: Manuel Pellegrini’s side in effect played with four forwards and got away with it defensively, partly because Noble provided vital midfield stability on his return to the team, exactly 15 years after his debut. Nick AmesMolineux witnessed a tired Wolves tear a point from the grip of Sean Dyche’s Burnley at the last on Sunday, but the crowd also got to watch two young English prospects strut their stuff. Morgan Gibbs-White was given a rare Premier League start for Wolves and, while he wasn’t alone in his failings, the midfielder fluffed his lines. On the Burnley side, however, the winger Dwight McNeil continued to show how important he is to the Clarets. A constant outlet who refused to lose the ball and was able to advance possession upfield without a burst of pace or having to throw a trick, the teenager looked the most composed player on the field and assisted Ashley Barnes for his goal. McNeil is not an England youth star like the Under-17 World Cup winner Gibbs-White but his future definitely looks bright.

The Bianconeri barely even bothered to introduce us to new cast members: only Adrien Rabiot making a 27-minute cameo. Instead there was an unexpected revival for the Gonzalo Higuaín character, thought to have been written out after he was packed off to London.Next up were Napoli – flawed but thrilling in a 4-3 triumph over Fiorentina to remind us of their status as doughty underdogs. And at the same time, the villains of the piece: referees and their nefarious VAR. There were not yet 10 minutes on the clock at the Stadio Artemio Franchi when Fiorentina were awarded a penalty following an on-field review. Gaetano Castrovilli had nudged a bouncing ball on to the arm of Piotr Zielinski.To most who have played the game, it looked like an unreasonable decision. But under the new interpretations of the handball law introduced this summer, it was a correct one. Zielinski had made his silhouette ‘unnaturally bigger’ by raising his arm to gain position on his opponent.Erick Pulgar converted, before Napoli equalised through Dries Mertens. The Belgian then won a penalty with a scandalous e. Pursuing a bouncing ball in the Fiorentina box, Mertens simply kicked his feet backwards in the vicinity of Castrovilli and went down. The referee, Davide Massa, could be forgiven for not seeing it clearly but the failure of the lead VAR official, Paolo Valeri, to alert him to his mistake was difficult to comprehend.Nikola Milenkovic pulled Fiorentina level after the break, only for José Callejon to put Napoli back in front. Kevin-Prince Boateng entered as a substitute for Fiorentina and slammed a 20-yard drive in off the post. Mertens, Callejon and Insigne all combined in one glorious movement to put Napoli back on top yet again.Fiorentina ought to have had a chance at a last-gasp equaliser. Franck Ribéry had been sent on in the 78th minute, and in the 92nd was dragged down by Elseid Hysaj. The contact started outside the penalty area but continued into it. Massa, despite being well positioned, did not whistle. Once again, Valeri failed to alert him to his mistake.As for Napoli, this was not quite the performance some of us envisaged of a team that has put together the best centre-back pairing in the ision. To take all three points, however, was crucial. Next up is a visit to Juventus.Fiorentina and Napoli set a tone for the weekend. On Sunday we would be treated to a similarly helter-skelter 3-3 draw between Roma and Genoa, with the Giallorossi three times unable to defend a lead under new manager Paulo Fonseca. Atalanta came back from 2-0 down to win away to Spal. Their last two goals were both scored by new signing Luis Muriel, off the bench.The greatest story, however, came in Verona – where Bologna manager Sinisa Mihajlovic appeared in the away dugout less than two months after being diagnosed with leukemia. This was the first time he had left hospital in 40 days, surprising his own players when he arrived in their team hotel shortly before they were due to travel to the stadium.Ever since revealing his diagnosis to the world at a tearful press conference last month, Mihajlovic has been adamant that he would return. “It will take a bit of time,” he said then, “but I will get better. This is the important thing. I explained it to my players as well. I cried a bit with them, too. I explained to them how we need to attack it. We play to win, not to avoid defeat. If we show fear, we don’t have courage, we defend, then the first goal we concede, we’re ruined. So I have to use the same tactics, that I like playing football. I will win this battle, definitely.”The language of battles will not be universally appreciated. It is wrong to imply that an inidual who dies from cancer has not fought hard enough. But Mihajlovic also has the right to define his experience on his terms. Even from his hospital bed, he has continued to coach his team, watching, advising and at times handing out stern dressings down via video chat.He left the Bentegodi frustrated on Sunday night. They had been a goal and a man up in the 15th minute, after Pawel Dawidowicz was sent off giving away a penalty which Nicola Sansone converted. Verona equalised through a Miguel Veloso free-kick.Mihajlovic returned to hospital afterwards. It is not known whether he will return to the bench for Friday’s game against Spal, or take a little more time to complete his treatment – a process which has taken a visible toll on his body. In any case, it was encouraging to see him on Sunday, doing the work he loves most.• Juventus’s bench on Saturday. It wouldn’t make for a very balanced starting XI but would you bet against it winning the league if it had to?• At least officiating mistakes are being taken seriously. Massa and Valeri have both been ‘dropped’ and will not return to Serie A duty until after the international break. That said, the new handball rule really is awful. Cagliari’s Alberto Cerri was penalised for the ball striking his arm while it was on its way back to his side after he jumped to try to win a header at a corner. He was facing away from the action. The ensuing penalty provided the only goal as the Sardinians lost to newly-promoted Brescia.• A deeply discouraging start for Milan, who lost to Udinese and failed to register a single shot on goal in their first game under Marco Giampaolo. Afterwards he hinted that he might already be getting ready to ditch his preferred 4-3-1-2 , suggesting that Krzysztof Piątek – dismal here and through much of pre-season – operates best as a lone striker.• Fresh season, fresh return for Wanda Icardi on Mediaset’s Tiki Taka. She insisted that she still expects her husband to stay at Inter, despite their repeated insistence that he’s not wanted. “He wants to play here,” she said. “I can bring a thousand offers to him, but he’s the one who decides.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453966a1c43c7835ea1ee95331fa817da0944e08/0_128_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dfec4c751020d4dca17cd7ec29d74e1","title":"timo werner deal rb leipzig underlines why bundesliga can be three horse race","story":"Feted, then slated, Timo Werner has since become one of Europe’s most sought-after forwards with LeipzigIt was, as Leipziger Volkszeitung put it, “an almost perfect Sunday”. Before the home game with Eintracht Frankfurt, RB Leipzig had big – and surprising – news, with the announcement that star forward Timo Werner had put pen to paper on a contract extension until 2023. It was followed by something that wasn’t a surprise at all, Werner celebrating in the most fitting way possible, giving his team the lead inside 10 minutes.The goal was the perfect reminder of why he is so highly prized, inside and outside the club. Marcel Sabitzer’s corner was helped on at the near post by Yussuf Poulsen – behind Werner, who twisted with one graceful, dextrous, instinctive movement to sweep inside Kevin Trapp’s far post. A difficult finish made simple, again. It also underlined the perfect synergy between Werner and Poulsen. “We know each other really well,” the latter reflected. “I’m very happy that he extended.”Most of us can make significant presumptions about players based on their on-pitch gait and demeanour. Werner is not looked upon as an alpha and is still judged by some Bundesliga fans for his move east when, as Leipzig’s first major domestic signing after promotion in 2016, he swapped sinking Stuttgart – his hometown club – for the rising newbies. Few knew what quite to expect, and even fewer approved. Having become Stuttgart’s youngest ever first-teamer when making his debut in an August 2013 Europa League qualifier – he was 17 years old and still at school – Werner had been visible, and feted, for a while. For feted, after that move to Leipzig, read slated.Some of the criticism from the terraces was harsh and personal, but Werner just brushed it off and his rise has been almost inseparable from Leipzig’s. In his three-season tenure, his goal tallies have been 21, 21 and 19. Strength is not one of the first adjectives most would use to describe a player largely defined by pace and guile – features which suit his current team down to the ground – but he has shown considerable fortitude not to let brickbats, his involvement in Germany’s miserable 2018 World Cup or his contractual situation knock him off course.Leipzig’s willingness to play hardball was already clear. A recent report in Bild suggested their latest move in their game of poker with Bayern was actually to up the asking price for Werner as the deadline approached, with the momentum having fallen from the champions’ transfer plans before the signings of Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho.Getting Werner to put pen to paper is an unexpected twist, though. It’s not necessarily the epilogue to the story between the forward and Bayern, with a high likelihood that an achievable release clause (around the €30m mark) or a gentlemen’s agreement with a view to a future transfer has been worked into the deal. That he is prepared to commit even his short-to-medium-term future to Leipzig is a huge vote of confidence for the club and new coach Julian Nagelsmann, a leader who exudes ambition. “Of course, this process has been going on for a very long time,” Werner said, ”but I really wanted to be completely sure that I could take the next steps in the development of this club. And for the right decisions you just need a little longer.”Exactly what those ambitions are, and how immediately Leipzig intend to realise them, is becoming acutely clear. Bayern have grabbed the spotlight by signing Coutinho, while Dortmund’s strong start rightly commands attention, but there is little reason why this Bundesliga can’t be a three-team race. Werner’s decision to commit to Leipzig, leaving Bayern as an option for later, suggests he feels that he has as much chance of the title right where he is now, with learning from Nagelsmann rather than working with Kovac – who is far from secure – the better bet.Leipzig were not vintage after Werner’s opener, with Frankfurt surprisingly spritely given their exacting Europa League derby with Strasbourg. Ante Rebic’s omission (after sporting director Fredi Bobic publicly tore him out for his current attitude) meant none of Adi Hütter’s big three up front were here, following the exits of Luka Jović to Real Madrid and Sébastien Haller to West Ham.The heatwave sweeping Germany – that elicited water breaks in the weekend’s games – had other effects too. Leipzig were unable to keep up their trademark intensity, sensibly opting to drop and conserve energy with the game seemingly under control – Nagelsmann later told reporters he felt his team had gained a “lucky victory”, which seemed harsh. The noise levels in the stands were subduedtoo, with fans at the Red Bull Arena reporting that no water was available during the first half and that, by the time it was, huge queues meant supporters missing several minutes of the game. On the pitch, Leipzig had a late wobble when Gonçalo Paciência pulled a goal back after Poulsen’s excellent volley made it 2-0.That Nagelsmann’s irritation was matched by his players’ thoughts, though, said a lot about how the new man and his charges are already on the same page, and the sort of standards he has instilled. Poulsen complained that, despite the win, “there were many things that we could have done a lot better, and that we did too slowly”.Werner’s expectations have always been high. His signature is acknowledgement of just where all of Leipzig thinks their team is going – right away.• Bayern kicked back into gear in the Saturday night game at Schalke. A biggie on paper, perhaps, but almost a slam dunk given Die Königsblauen’s current toothless state. This was brought into sharp relief by Robert Lewandowski’s imperious hat-trick – a penalty, a sensational free-kick and a beautifully taken third from Kingsley Coman’s assist. David Wagner, on his home debut as Schalke coach, had reason to be upset at the lack of intervention after apparent handballs by Benjamin Pavard and Perisic went uncalled by VAR.• Kudos to Bayern’s travelling fans as well, ensuring that the racist outburst of the currently suspended Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies was not forgotten. “Only one of many,” said their banner. “Red card for racists.”Four others have also won two out of two Leipzig, Freiburg, Leverkusen and Wolfsburg, who won 3-0 at Hertha."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd3a67b4163fe19a747eb41a5da5ef324c9b6a71/0_211_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d84aa854f92c348b6bd536db8db633","title":"how we met i was taken aback at how beautiful she was","story":"Clare and Ryan Moulder, who are in their 40s, met in 1997. They live in Slough and have two childrenOn Clare’s first day at work 22 years ago, Ryan was the first person she was introduced to. They were at the Mars confectionery company, in the wrapping area of the factory that made Twix bars. Clare was 24 Ryan was 20. “He’s 6ft 3in, dark and handsome,” she says. The head-to-toe white overalls look good on men, she adds. “I thought: ‘Wow!’ straight away. But I was at work and I thought: ‘I’m here to do a job, not find my potential husband.’”Did Ryan notice her? “It’s a very male-dominated area, and seeing a young lady walk into the factory, and especially one so pretty, yeah, it was a big day. I remember being taken aback at how beautiful she was.”Clare smiles. “I don’t remember you saying that.”Although they were part of a friendly, close-knit team, the couple found it hard to get time together. Their break times rarely coincided. On top of that, Clare says her factory outfit – hairnet, hard hat, steel-toe-capped boots, white overalls – was not the most flattering. “I had to do my best every day to look as good as I possibly could,” she says. “My eyebrows would be done, although I couldn’t wear too much makeup.”She says he was oblivious to the fact she liked him. “I would try to engineer it so we were on the same break pattern, and I’d try to organise lots of social events,” she says. Did he like her? “I did,” says Ryan. “But I’m not a very macho, chase-the-ladies sort of person.” It took about six months of Clare “being quite underhand”, she says, before they got together on a night out, and Ryan says they have been pretty much inseparable ever since.They moved in together six months later and worked together on the factory floor for another two years. “You spend a lot of time with those people who are working the same shifts as you,” says Ryan. “It was young love and we didn’t want that space – we were quite happy spending all our time together.”What did they like about each other? “The most important thing is our sense of humour is the same,” says Ryan. And their values, Clare adds. At work “you find a lot of people who share the same values. I think that was the thing that has kept us together, and at work as well – it feels like it’s all wrapped up in our life.”They are both still at Mars, a company they love, where employees are called Martians. Clare did a degree and now works in marketing Ryan is in factory planning. “There are days when I won’t see him at all, and there are days when I’ll see him in the canteen,” she says. “It never really gets too much.” And they rarely talk about work at home, he says.Do they eat chocolate all day? Ryan laughs and says he has type 1 diabetes, so has to watch his sugar intake. Working in a chocolate factory does have its advantages, however. “I’ve had a couple of low blood-sugar attacks, and chocolate is one of the things you can use to fight them.’” Their house is a magnet for trick or treaters at Halloween, says Clare.Is she surprised that she and Ryan are still together, more than two decades on? “It sounds so trite, but when you know, you know,” she says. “My dad used to say: ‘You and Ryan are cut from the same cloth.’”A few weeks ago, Ryan’s aunt died. She got Ryan the job at Mars, and worked for the company for a remarkable 73 years. They were close. “I was trying to be strong for my dad, keep a stiff upper lip, and then at the end when everyone was filtering out after the funeral, Clare came to see me and I broke down,” he says, “because it was Clare.

His blood test came back with low testosterone levels. “We went to see a urologist and he said bluntly that we wouldn’t have any options to have kids with my sperm – we would have to use a donor or adopt,” he says. “My wife immediately burst into tears.” The couple had been trying for a child since they married in 2015. Paul was also devastated. “It put so much stress on me, because I thought I couldn’t give my wife or my family what they so desperately wanted.”Eventually, Paul was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome. Affecting about one in 600 men, it is one of the most common genetic conditions in the UK, yet most people have never heard of it – including many who have it. Its symptoms – extra height, persistent tiredness, reduced bodily hair and small testes – can be difficult to identify, meaning it often goes unnoticed by patients and GPs. Untreated, however, it can lead to reduced testosterone and infertility, and even increased prevalence of testicular cancer.The non-hereditary syndrome was first discovered in 1942. It is caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome, resulting in XXY, as opposed to XY. With only one in six men who have Klinefelter’s ever diagnosed, even though symptoms often emerge during puberty, it may be one of the leading unexplored causes of infertility. Now, the first clinic in the UK to deal solely with Klinefelter’s has opened at Guy’s hospital in London – and its clinicians believe it could revolutionise its treatment and diagnosis.“By the time the Klinefelter’s patients get to us, they’re pretty much wrecks, since it can take up to two years to get the diagnosis,” says the urologist Tet Yap, who founded the clinic. The wait time is so long because patients are often referred by their GP (or, in some cases, by an infertility clinic) to a urologist and then an endocrinologist. Yap’s clinic is a “one-stop shop”, where patients can be seen by all the relevant specialists in one appointment.“Most men are only diagnosed when they struggle to conceive,” Yap says. “This will be when they are in their 30s or older. And then they are often told they are totally infertile, which can be false information and devastating to receive.” The new clinic has genetic counsellors and psychosexual experts on hand to help patients come to terms with the potentially bad news and to plan the next steps for treatment. “The process of diagnosis and then treatment is exhausting. I really feel for these guys spending so long not knowing what’s wrong with them,” Yap says. “A lot of them are told they’re just making up their symptoms.” After the crushing assessment by the urologist, Paul and his wife went to a private fertility clinic, which eventually referred him to Yap. The process took 18 months, even with private investment.If men wish to pursue fertility treatment, the NHS currently funds it only through a female partner, which many clinicians feel is anachronistic and potentially damaging. “Partner fertility reduces with age. Normally by the time the men have been diagnosed, most of their partners have crossed the age limit for IVF funding, so it’s very frustrating for them,” says Yap. “They will have been on the pathway for two or three years, then finally get told: ‘Sorry, your partner doesn’t have access to funding.’”Yap told Paul and his wife that they had a chance of conceiving themselves: Paul would need to start testosterone, then undergo a relatively new surgical procedure called microTESE – microsurgical testicular sperm extraction – by which sperm is extracted from the testes’ tubules. Paul has since had one, unsuccessful, round of IVF through microTESE, with another scheduled for March. “Because we were told ‘no’ right at the beginning, this opportunity is such a bonus. It wouldn’t happen without Yap and the clinic being here to put to rest all the uncertainty I was feeling for those 18 months.” He now volunteers at the clinic as a patient liaison, helping those with new diagnoses understand their options. “We need to encourage a greater awareness among GPs and men to get early diagnoses, because if you only find out when you want to have kids, like I did, then waiting years for treatment can feel like a lifetime.”Paul credits his wife’s support for enabling him to persist with the treatment others have been less fortunate. Raj Baksi, 46, found out he has Klinefelter’s a decade ago when he was trying for a child with his wife. After an unsuccessful microTESE operation, his relationship broke down. “Infertility can change everything,” he says. Baksi has since become involved with the Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association and runs Facebook support groups for affected men from across the globe. “There’s a stigma around Klinefelter’s: some people’s families are really unsupportive, their friends can be embarrassed, and even some employers can see you differently. Many people won’t publicly disclose they have it, which means they don’t get the support they need.”Alison Bridges, the chair of the Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association, says this is one of the reasons why the condition is largely unrecognised. “GPs think it’s rarer than it is, but it’s not rare – it’s just rarely diagnosed,” she says. “There is a lack of awareness, since men often don’t come forward, even if they are diagnosed, so we want to get them together to at least feel they are not alone in this.” The association has been running weekend camps for men with Klinefelter’s for the past 19 years, to encourage them to talk to each other. “Klinefelter’s men can often find it difficult to express themselves emotionally, as one of their symptoms,” says Bridges. “But on these weekends away we’ve seen huge changes in their outlook, from despair to hope.”Leila Frodsham, a psychosexual specialist, works at the clinic to help men with Klinefelter’s gain the confidence to address their condition, as well as to help increase their chances of conceiving. “With Klinefelter’s, we might replace men’s testosterone or give them pills to perform better sexually, but then they still have an overriding anxiety that makes it difficult to have sex,” she says. “When sex becomes more about procreation than pleasure, it causes all sorts of problems, so I act as a voice for my patients, so they feel they can overcome this situation.”Charlotte Tomlinson, a genetic counsellor, says diagnosed men and their partners also need to prepare for the possibility of infertility, even after treatment. “The diagnosis is a huge challenge to masculine identity, especially if you’re trying for a child at the same time,” she says. “A lot of my work is broaching the subject of how to cope with the loss if the treatment doesn’t work.”Henry Mitchell, 30, attended the first clinic Yap ran, in April, and has since had a successful microTESE operation to freeze his sperm for the future. “It was a huge relief that they could find sperm,” he says. “I’m lucky I found out early, because it could’ve been when I wanted kids and then it would’ve been a much lengthier and harder process. This has given me a safety net for the future.”The clinic has limited capacity, but with all 10 slots for October filled and a growing waiting list, Yap believes it will only grow. “We’re already getting people coming from all over the country and even requests from abroad. Having all these specialists in one place also means we can develop new research and methods of better administering testosterone. These men and their partners shouldn’t have to live in such uncertainty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6307e29248d2bdb984aa14623a333eac8341f2e/0_233_4694_2816/master/4694.jpg?width=4500\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f2f9b418102a24a901164b6816dc9d5 9000w","title":"gotterdammerung review ring cycle edinburgh andrew davis royal scottish national orchestra","story":"Usher Hall, EdinburghAndrew Davis and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra take Wagner’s epic music drama to a vibrant and energised conclusion, with Christine Goerke a luminous BrünnhildeThis was the culmination of Edinburgh international festival’s four-year Ring cycle in concert and as such one of the hottest tickets at this year’s EIF. Such anticipation can lead to disappointment, but this proved to be an event that lived up to its hype. Andrew Davis and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the partnership behind the lauded Walküre at the 2017 festival, once again took to the Usher Hall stage for the final instalment of Wagner’s epic music drama. Apparently, the original intention was to have a different orchestra-conductor partnership for each opera but so successful was the Davis-RSNO collaboration in Walküre that they got the call up for Götterdämmerung.Many of the singers had likewise appeared in previous instalments, but none was more central to the success of the performance than soprano Christine Goerke. Having scaled the heights of the complete Ring cycle at the politan Opera earlier this year, Goerke is the Brünnhilde of the moment. It’s not difficult to see why. Her luminous soprano has the vocal strength to surmount the mighty Wagnerian orchestra without sounding forced or harsh. Allied with genuine dramatic capabilities, hers is an all-too-human account of the warrior goddess, a seductive combination of pathos and power.Goerke’s may have been the standout performance but there was plenty of interest elsewhere, particularly Ain Anger’s splendidly world-weary, implacable Hagen and Karen Cargill in the dual roles of Waltraute and Second Norn. Greek soprano Danae Kontora who made an impression as a last-minute stand-in Woodbird in Siegfried returned in her own right as an equally flirtatious Rhinemaiden. Burkhard Fritz, a new addition to the cast, was a solid although rather soft-toned Siegfried.Wagner in the concert hall can be as much symphony as opera but Andrew Davis’s coolly measured controlled approach ensured that the performance was never static or self-indulgent. It might have been a little restrained for those who like their Wagner swooning and swooping, but its elegant pacing brought life to the light and shade of the music the ecstatic outpourings sudden and exciting. Under his direction a vibrant, energised RSNO gave a burnished, nuanced account of the score.At the close of the EIF, it was a timely reminder that at their best festivals can foster artistic partnerships to create something truly outstanding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdd7e0b377bdc931603a9be49c35097b15e273b8/0_44_2927_1756/master/2927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94b84f9cc4c836e247c63e0861c1ed64","title":"reading and leeds festival review scorching post gcse blowout","story":"Bramham Park, LeedsThe 1975’s pop-funk and Foo Fighters’ blistering hard rock fire up the twin-site festival, while Billie Eilish steals the show‘Be wild, be weird, be wonderful, and take the feeling of love and community here and spread it far and wide,” Rou Reynolds of hardcoreelectronica band Enter Shikari tells Leeds festival, having a Woodstock moment.

The frontman’s wildest rock fantasies couldn’t have scripted a man randomly buzzing the crowd on a gyroscope during Learning to Fly or performing Queen and David Bowie’s Under Pressure with a Freddie Mercury lookalike plucked spontaneously from the audience. It’s obviously a kind of magic.But the 1975 are the first headline act to grab the zeitgeist, as angry new single People issues a punky rallying call to apathetic youth (“We are appalling and we need to stop just watching shit in bed”), before the set otherwise settles into trademark INXS-style pop-funk. Endearingly earnest frontman Matty Healy explains why he flouted Dubai’s strict laws to kiss a male fan (“It’s not me that needs to change, it’s the world”) and stands respectfully as his band musically accompany a Greta Thunberg speech on the climate emergency (it’s the first track on their forthcoming album) to rapturous applause.The story of the weekend, though, is that of 17-year-old singer Billie Eilish. Initially booked to play the Radio 1 tent, her booming popularity brought a hurried shift to the main stage, where her late afternoon slot draws a vast crowd comparable to that for Arctic Monkeys’ debut here 13 years ago. With her green hair and graffitied clothes, the American looks more climate protester than mainstream pop star but clearly has the voice and talent to be anything she wants. She requests the crowd to “jump like kangaroos”. Her 40-minute, 13-song set covers subjects from sexuality to self-loathing and careers from sub bass rap to jazzy piano ballads. She leaves the field in triumph, a superstar and headline act in every aspect apart from her position on the bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0518566ccd59b0ad457b7d53d54ceb6fd3050a33/1124_477_1642_985/master/1642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb6c0a7ab2e5f83d306c96f2c4fd0b4","title":"what is the menopause and when does it strike","story":"It’s a natural part of the female life cycle – so why don’t we talk more about the menopause, its debilitating effects and possible mitigation?The menopause is when a woman’s fertile period comes to a halt. This is generally a gradual process over months or even years, but technically the menopause is defined as when a woman has gone 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for this happening is 52 years, but about one in 100 women have a menopause before the age of 40.The menopause is programmed into female biology. It begins when the ovaries have too few eggs to keep powering the ovulation cycle. From childhood, the ovaries have thousands of eggs (200,000, say, but the number varies widely). These cells are constantly moving along a fertility conveyor belt, taking months to grow from primitive follicle to the mature egg which is released during ovulation. The process operates in a knock-out pyramid, with most eggs dying off along the way and only about 400 ever graduating to ovulation.The primordial follicles activate in clusters that grow and compete, with one egg (normally just one) winning out each month. But as women approach the menopause, the remaining follicles become more sparsely spaced. Beyond some critical threshold, they are no longer packed densely enough to exchange the chemical signals with their neighbours that allow them to activate in clusters. So even though eggs remain, they are dormant.“It’s almost like they’re losing their friends,” says Prof Evelyn Telfer, of the University of Edinburgh. “When the woman gets older and when there’s a very low number they just don’t activate.”The follicles release oestrogen as they grow. So when they stop maturing, there is a steep drop in the levels of the hormone being produced, and that’s what leads to menopausal symptoms.Symptoms usually start a few months or years before a woman’s periods stop – a phase known as the perimenopause – and on average last about four years from the last period. However, around one in 10 women experience symptoms for up to 12 years.The first indication of the menopause is a change in the normal pattern of a woman’s periods – they may become either unusually light or heavy and could arrive with shorter breaks or be absent for months at a time.Other symptoms include vaginal dryness, changes in libido, mood swings, memory problems and higher risk of osteoporosis.It is possible, through IVF treatment using either eggs frozen pre-menopause or donor eggs. Biomedical progress might open up other options. Post-menopause, women still have hundreds of follicles left in the ovaries and scientists have demonstrated that it is possible to grow these follicles into mature eggs in the lab.A Japanese team is using a version of this technique in a clinical trial of an experimental fertility treatment called IV-activation, in which ovarian tissue is extracted, treated in the lab to encourage the follicles to mature and then grafted back into the ovary. They speculate that in the future, post-menopausal women might be able to have babies using such treatment.The age at which a woman enters menopause is partly inherited. So asking your mother or grandmother is a good place to start. Some clinics offer ultrasound tests aimed at assessing the ovarian reserve. The scans can only see the most mature egg cells – the follicles are too small to spot – and the tests are not very accurate at predicting when the menopause will begin.Scientists are identifying ever more genes that contribute to the age menopause begins, but since it is a trait that is influenced by a large number of genes, it is not yet possible to get an accurate readout from a genetic test.One of the most compelling evolutionary explanations for menopause is the “reproductive conflict hypothesis”. The idea is that when multiple generations live together in a patrilocal set up (that’s to say, a woman moving in with her husband’s parents), a woman would compete with her mother-in-law for the resources needed for babies and children if their reproductive schedules overlapped.Research by Prof Virpi Lummaa, of the University of Turku in Finland, using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, showed that simultaneous reproduction by daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law was linked to a far worse chance of children surviving.“Our modelling work showed that such costs of two women reproducing simultaneously in the same household were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years,” Lummaa says.It’s interesting to note that this evolutionary trade-off only happens when males continue to live with their families as adults. Lummaa’s team studied Asian elephants employed in timber camps in Myanmar and found that calves survived better if their grandmother was nearby. However, Asian elephants do not show a clear-cut menopause and have been observed to reproduce into their late 60s.A crucial difference could be that elephants live in matriarchal herds, led by a dominant older female. So, thanks, prehistoric patriarchy.There are a few contenders – guppies gasp on for a few weeks after their last litter, which some have suggested is the fish menopause. But whales are the only real parallel. Killer whales, short-finned pilot whales, belugas and narwhals all live substantial periods beyond their reproductive years.The main one is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hot flushes and other symptoms are caused by the loss of oestrogen in the body as the ovaries stop producing it. However, oestrogen causes the womb lining to grow, which raises the risk of endometrial cancer. To protect the lining of the uterus, combined HRT is normally given, which contains progesterone as well. It can be taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants.Cons: increases the chances that a woman will get breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The extent of this cancer risk has been at the heart of the controversy surrounding HRT. A large study by the Institute of Cancer Research in London found that women who took combined HRT for five years were 2.7 times more likely to get breast cancer than those who did not. Other studies have found slightly lower increases in risk. However, a major study last year found that HRT does not shorten lives – so while women on HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer they are not more likely to die at a younger age.Also, on stopping HRT some but not all women will experience a return of menopause symptoms.Some people find alternative therapies such as acupuncture, phytoestrogens or black cohosh helpful, although systematic reviews have not found strong evidence to support these approaches making a measurable difference.There are also new drugs on the horizon that work in different ways to HRT. One of the most promising is a compound called MLE4901, originally developed by AstraZeneca. It targets a chemical in the brain called neurokinin B, which is known to increase in response to oestrogen deficiency. The idea is that it would control symptoms without affecting hormone levels – and so hopefully sidestepping the downsides of HRT.Astellas, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, is now running a phase 2 trial. “It works ridiculously well,” says Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial, who led the trial. “The patients in our study were saying please can we carry on with the drug.”It’s clearly subjective, but many women would view no more periods and not needing to worry about unplanned pregnancies as positives. There is also evidence that women generally feel good post-menopause. One study by Australian scientists, which followed women for 20 years from the early 1990s found that negative mood scores and depressive symptoms decreased significantly as they transitioned from midlife (50–64) to late-life (over 65).Menopause: The Complete Guide to Maintaining Health and Well-being and Managing Your Life, by Miriam StoppardHot Flushes Cold Science: A History of the Modern Menopause, by Louise FoxcroftGalloping Catastrophe: Musings of a Menopausal Woman, by Jennifer Kennedy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7afb4b6e8bb72fc668df267effb174d8ddb725e4/397_165_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b53c859bbec1b20b19b5ae26a37d2b","title":"priti patel accused of conflict of interest in mod contract","story":"Lib Dems ask home secretary to clarify relationship with US military tech supplier ViasatThe home secretary, Priti Patel, has been urged to withdraw from cabinet discussions about a lucrative £6bn defence contract, after it emerged that the US company that paid her £1,000 an hour to advise it plans to bid for the work.Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats’ home affairs spokesperson, said the fact that Patel had worked for Viasat in the period running up to her appointment as home secretary created the risk of a conflict of interest now she was in government.The Californian company has declared it wants to bid on the contract to supply next-generation military satellite communication systems, called Skynet 6, in a bidding process run by the Ministry of Defence that is expected to start next year.Viasat spelled out its interest in bidding for Skynet 6 in a corporate blog from February which quotes a company executive saying that the UK has “an enormous opportunity” to deploy expertise from “private sector … providers, including Viasat”.Patel originally declared on 3 June, when she was a backbencher, that she worked as a “strategic adviser” to Viasat from 1 May to 31 July, earning £5,000 a month for “an expected commitment” of about five hours a month.That prompted the Lib Dems to ask her to “immediately confirm when her work with Viasat ended”, because that appeared to overlap with the Brexiter’s appointment as home secretary on 24 July.Although the Skynet contract falls under the Ministry of Defence, opposition politicians believe that such a strategically significant procurement could be discussed across government with other ministers responsible for national security.Jardine said: “The British public cannot have confidence that this multibillion-pound defence contract will be decided in the national interest while one of the cabinet ministers in the discussions was until very recently a paid adviser to one of the companies bidding for it.”Home Office sources said Patel had been “through a full process” of examination by the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), the body that monitors private sector employment by ministers and ex-ministers, and that “no issues were raised”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a8a5b71c34bab2fb830de3bf7c942f53c87eafc/948_71_1576_946/master/1576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3873c531fb026b1d2372a66d6977243","title":"mandatory workplace menopause policies uk","story":"Action urged as research shows the impact of symptoms on large proportion of workforceBritish MPs are pushing for clear workplace policies to protect women going through the menopause, which exacts a hefty personal and professional toll on as many as one in four females.A menopause policy should be as commonplace as maternity schemes in businesses and organisations, said the MPs, some of whom want legislation to force through the reforms.Women have told the  how their careers have been ruined by symptoms such as anxiety, confusion and loss of confidence. Some have faced disciplinary action and many have been forced to take time off, while others have sold their homes so they can afford to work part-time or stop working altogether.The Labour MP Carolyn Harris said: “You wouldn’t dream of having a workplace where people weren’t entitled to certain things because they were pregnant, and it’s exactly the same for women with the menopause. I firmly believe there should be legislation to make sure every workplace has a menopause policy, just like they have a maternity policy.”The often unspoken impact of menopause on women at work has become a cross-party issue. The Conservative MP Rachel Maclean was the first to speak out about it in the House of Commons and has been campaigning to normalise menopause as a workplace issue.She said she wants women to be able to have time off or change shift patterns or conditions of work when they need relief from symptoms that often go well beyond the stereotypical hot flushes and night sweats.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbsp“I absolutely agree that employers need to do more. It’s not well understood,” Maclean said. “Employees don’t get the support they need. It is very difficult for women at work often.” She said she had heard many “horrific and heart-rending” accounts.“My central message is: menopause is the last taboo because it is still hidden and it only affects women and it only affects older women. It’s ageism, it’s sexism, all rolled into one.”Harris said she believed that if legislation was required, it would be passed by MPs. There was “tremendous support” across the benches when the house debated the issue recently, “especially from men whose wives have been through it. They understand.”Harris told of going to see a GP in 2010 after she had treatment for a gynaecological condition. “I was having a nervous breakdown,” she said. “I was really depressed and had mental health issues. I think that’s down to the fact I was going through the menopause. So many women end up on antidepressants or being told to pull themselves together.”Amanda Griffiths, a professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Nottingham who has done substantial research on the impact of the menopause on working women, said it had “quite a significant impact” on the personal and professional lives of up to a quarter of women.She said women made up an increasing proportion of the ageing workforce. “For me there is a big issue here, which is not just about women having problems with menopause. It is about managers understanding it is perfectly normal for us to have health problems,” she said.There needed to be an atmosphere at work where people could talk about health, she said, “instead of which we tend to have this fear in some organisations that if we have a health condition there will be some sort of stigma attached to i”.Two separate surveys of women going through the menopause and perimenopause – the time leading up to when ovulation stops – found they were struggling in work and felt unsupported by managers.Just over half had taken time off sick, and one in 10 had missed more than eight weeks of work.A separate survey by the shop workers’ union Usdaw found that one in five women had taken time off work and that more than half did not feel able to approach their managers if they were suffering.In the Newson Health survey, more than a third said their employer did not offer any kind of discussion group, awareness session or training on the subject of menopause, despite there being more than 5 million working women aged between 45 and 60.Dr Rebecca Lewis, a GP who works at Newson Health, said: “Women are suffering quietly for fear of saying ‘it’s the menopause’ and being laughed at and told to get on with it.“A GP might not think to put it down, or the woman might not want it put down because of a feeling that it’s not a ‘proper’ illness.”Sue Hackett, the London regional equality officer at the GMB union, said: “It is high time we stop treating menstruation and menopause as taboo subjects. Women have put up with insulting comments and a woeful lack of provision for far too long for what is a completely natural condition.”She said workplace policies around sickness absence or performance management could unfairly penalise women “because of key symptoms like memory loss or lack of concentration”.Unions said there were examples of good practice in workplaces. In 2017, Nottinghamshire police introduced a menopause policy and issued guidance to managers saying they could consider requests from women who needed to adjust their uniform or their working hours.Among other practical support, it recommended access to private areas where women could “rest temporarily, cry or talk with a colleague before they can return to their workspace”.The Welsh government has put in place guidance for its workers. It said: “All reasonable adjustments will be considered when a health issue may be impacting on a person’s ability to carry out their role – this can include changing working location or conditions for a more comfortable working life.”Last year an employment tribunal judge found in favour of Mandy Davies, a court officer working for the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service who was dismissed after an incident involving medication she was taking.Davies alleged that under the 2010 Equality Act she had been unfairly dismissed and discriminated against as a result of a disability.The tribunal heard how she had been suffering from symptoms including heavy bleeding, memory loss and confusion, and that she had previously had a 20-year unblemished employment record.Her employer accepted that the menopause was a disability, but argued it had not unfairly dismissed her as a consequence, a position the judge did not accept, ruling that she should be reinstated and paid £14,000.The court service is appealing against the decision."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d22955fb90f496c6d2af273263992f6bffa3b45/0_0_5905_3543/master/5905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20256cb3edaa4560d1b499263d76b218","title":"menopause experts say compounded hrt is unsafe","story":"Women told not to use cBHRT because of concerns over ‘purity, potency and safety’Women are being warned not to use a form of hormone replacement therapy marketed as being “more natural” than that available from NHS doctors, with experts saying it is unsafe, expensive and could increase the risk of developing cancer.Compounded bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (cBHRT) is tailor-made for each person, using hormones identical to those produced in a woman’s body. The hormone combinations are put together, usually as creams or gels, by pharmacists working in private clinics. The dose of the different hormones used varies from one woman to the next.The menopause is a natural part of ageing and usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age after levels of the hormone oestrogen have declined to the point where ovulation and menstruation stop. It is defined as a woman going 12 months without a period. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 52. However, about one in 100 women have their menopause before the age of 40.Common symptoms can include hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and discomfort during sex, a reduced sex drive, low moods or anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Memory and concentration can also be affected.\u0026nbspThe British Menopause Society (BMS) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have warned women away from the products, which are becoming increasingly popular.Menopause experts said women should opt instead for the pre-packed regulated bioidentical HRT (rBHRT). These therapies, available on the NHS, are also duplicates of human hormones but are in fixed doses and licensed by the medicines regulator.Hormone replacement therapy is the main form of treatment for severe menopause symptoms, such as hot flushes, insomnia and low mood. Taken in the form of pills, patches, gels or implants, it acts by replacing oestrogen, or oestrogen and progesterone, in the body.The unregulated version has recently increased in popularity because of a proliferation of online pharmacies and active marketing to consumers. However the BMS and RCOG said there could be problems with overdosing or underdosing, the presence of impurities or lack of sterility, a lack of scientific efficacy and safety data (compounded products are not tested on humans) and a lack of labelling to outline risks.The experts also said the cBHRT practice of saliva and serum hormone testing to determine dosing was unreliable.In September, a group of major international menopause organisations will issue a global position statement warning against the use of compounded bioidentical testosterone therapy for men, which experts say raises exactly the same concerns.The BMS and RCOG have become so concerned by the increasing use of cBHRT that they have taken the unprecedented step of issuing a full consensus statement.“Every expert in the field shares the same view and concerns about compounded hormones: it’s unsafe, untested and unnecessary. We are concerned by its purity, potency and safety,” said Haitham Hamoda, the chair of the BMS, spokesperson for the RCOG and a consultant gynaecologist at King’s College hospital foundation trust.The experts say the dose of oestrogen in cBHRT may be higher or lower than it needs to be to control symptoms, and that the dose of progesterone may not always be sufficient to protect the womb. “If the womb is not sufficiently protected, there is a cancer risk,” Hamoda said.Many cBHRT applications deliver progesterone through the skin. “Absorption is variable with fluctuating tissue availability and as a result, may not provide sufficient protection for wombs,” Hamoda said. “Again, that’s a cancer risk.”Dr Louise Newson, a menopause expert, said: “We see many women at Newson Health clinic who have spent considerable amounts of money on these bioidentical products and have experienced numerous side effects.“Compounded bioidentical products are not regulated or approved and so could potentially be harmful. In addition, there is no evidence that these bioidentical hormones have fewer side effects or are more effective than prescribed HRT.”In 2017, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled against the promotion of cBHRT as having greater safety and efficacy than rBHRT, and said there was insufficient evidence to back the practice of cBHRT practitioners using expensive serum and saliva tests to inidualise therapy.However, the Marion Gluck Clinic, which claims to be the leading UK medical clinic specialising in the use of bioidentical hormones, defended cBHRT.“Just like any other medical practice, the Marion Gluck Training Academy is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC),” a spokesperson said. “In addition, compounding cBHRT is carried out under strict supervision of a qualified pharmacist on a named patient basis.”The popularity of cBHRT rose after the publication of findings in 2002 that conventional HRT carried a cancer risk. In the following years, there were a number of high-profile endorsements for cBHRT, including from Oprah Winfrey and Jeanette Winterson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Gauff was announced as a participant in the Citi Open in Washington DC but the announcement came with a caveat – her ranking was too low and the WTA’s age eligibility rules meant she was unable to receive another wildcard, so her participation in the competition was in doubt. She would head to the capital to host fan activities and to showcase her best at practice sessions. The hope was that enough players would withdraw at the last minute to offer her a spot in the qualifying draw.Gauff’s prayers were answered and she refused to waste the opportunity. She entered the singles qualifying draw at the 11th hour, where she qualified for the main draw and then won her first WTA event in doubles alongside the 17-year-old Caty McNally. Gauff’s presence brought a record crowd to the tournament’s qualifying rounds and her doubles matches overflowed with frantic spectators as the singles matches on the main courts were empty. In a sport that does not survive without the stars that generate ticket sales and attention, a new one had been born.Throughout the US summer, tournaments have moved heaven and earth to accommodate Gauff. They see her drawing power and they want to ensure that they can make money from her success. Since Gauff’s ranking and tournament limitations made her participation in later WTA events unlikely, she was drafted into the ATP tournament in Winston Salem last week for an exhibition match against the French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty. Although she had reached her wildcard limit under the WTA’s age eligibility rules, the US Open skirted the regulations, which technically apply only to WTA and ITF events, to offer her a wildcard. The decision has produced some backlash.“No, I don’t get that,” said Naomi Osaka to the suggestion that Gauff’s wildcard could yield negative results. “Like, come on. This is such a good experience for her. She obviously deserves to play here. She played well in Wimbledon, she’s super young and, for me, it’s the same as if someone plays the US Open juniors just to gain experience for how the main tournament is. Except she can actually play the main tournament. I don’t see how it would harm her at all.”But the history of women’s tennis is riddled with young supernovas whose success would eventually cause them harm. Jennifer Capriati arrived in the sport as a bubbly all‑American 13-year-old yet her career burnout remains a cautionary tale, the primary reason why so many restrictions remain in place for Gauff. Anna Kournikova flitted to the Wimbledon semi-finals at 16 and then flitted out shortly afterwards with a chronic back injury.Today, the increased physicality of tennis has piled on more pressure for a young, growing body. Belinda Bencic reached the US Open quarter‑finals in 2014 at 17 years of age, then defeated Serena Williams in a blaze of fireworks to win her first big title in Toronto the following year. It took until this year for Bencic to shake off incessant injuries and recover her collapsed ranking.The rising prize money means players are now richer in the early stages of their careers. Alexander Zverev, billed as the next great star a year ago, has spent much of 2019 coming to terms with the reality of being a business that many people want a part of. He is now embroiled in an expensive and bitter legal dispute with his former manager, with whom he signed as a youth. Osaka reflected on her own struggles since reaching the top ranking. “You know the song Mo Money Mo Problems?” she said, smiling. “Man, oh, man.”Gauff exudes confidence. At Wimbledon she asserted that she was there to win the tournament and nobody doubted that she meant it. Her broad shoulders are made for the pressure and weight she now carries on them each day. When she faces Anastasia Potapova, her fellow teen and another junior slam champion, on Tuesday, it is hard to imagine that she will not be ready. The question is whether Gauff will be ready for the rest of her career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f05c5903ebfa47be69b7c2426dd32e4b8aebfd3/0_85_4562_2738/master/4562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b2db6ba9c41ffc57bde7f27cc1a49d","title":"australia reaction ashes third test defeat","story":"From praise for the ‘indomitable’ Ben Stokes to hand-wringing over ‘a national cricketing nightmare’, this loss won’t be easily forgottenDrink it in, England. Intravenously connect this to your veins. While you’ve been sleeping or celebrating, Australia has been despairing over the devastation of Headingley, with innumerable takes appearing across the country each attempting to reckon with Ben Stokes’s unprecedented heroics.While Wikipedia was busy revising its explanation of the Ashes to “a Test cricket series played between Ben Stokes and Australia”, across the wide brown land there is benevolence, blame and everything in between. And it’s not just cricket experts proffering reactions. The result in Leeds went to the very top (administratively speaking), with prime minister Scott Morrison electing to comment from the G7 Summit in Biarritz, saying he was awaiting some stick from his UK counterpart Boris Johnson.“I’m sure he will give me a hard time about the fact they clipped us in the latest Ashes,” said Morrison, before adding, “which many of you from other countries wouldn’t have the faintest idea what I’m talking about – but the Australian journalists and British journalists will know very, very well.”Elsewhere, most sane commentators took pains to commend Stokes. In The Australian, Peter Lalor wrote: “Forget Ian Botham’s efforts in 1981, forget Don Bradman and Arthur Morris’s in 1948 – Ben Stokes has single-handedly pulled off one of the most remarkable Ashes victories in a place where the remarkable happens.” He went on: “Stokes was incredible. Indomitable. Unbelievable.”What if Nathan Lyon didn’t fumble a run out at the death? What if captain Tim Paine didn’t burn the review that would have seen Stokes lbw the next ball? What if Joel Wilson had functioning eyesight? Even Gwyneth Paltrow would have been impressed with the number of sliding doors the final half hour produced. On this front, Gideon Haigh addressed the question of luck, saying “there remains in cricket an abiding belief in the rub of the green, which Stokes had by then mightily earned. What a cricketer”.In keeping with the theme of magnanimity, Fairfax’s Greg Baum shone a light on the glory of Test cricket itself, writing: “Call off Test cricket now… let’s all die happy now, or only a little bit sad, and permanently awe-struck.” And Haigh again: “Here was a referendum that, just for a change, had no loser. Nobody who played, watched, described or officiated in this third Test could feel anything other than honoured to have been part of it.” Even Russell Crowe was in the mood to commend.So far, so noble. But not everybody processes a gut-punching loss with such high-mindedness and perspective. Another popular way to handle heartache is to attribute substantial dosages of blame, and just about every masthead delivered here.“The four blunders that sealed Australia’s fate at Headingley”, screamed Fox Sports. “Three massive blunders and umpiring howler that may cost Australia the Ashes,” roared ABC Grandstand. “The moments that cost Australia the third Test,” boomed The Australian. Each searched for catharsis in the torment, variously covering Marcus Harris’s dropped catch, the wasted review, Lyon’s fumble, and Joel’s lbw decision.This was “a national cricketing nightmare that will put Michael Kasprowicz’s right glove in the shade,” Fox Sports said, before evoking memories of Herschelle Gibbs’s infamous dropped catch at the World Cup in 1999. “Did he just drop the Ashes?” the piece asks. Interestingly, Gibbs’ spill occurred at Headingley, too.According to the Kübler-Ross model, denial is the first in five stages of grieving, and The Australian ensured that sizeable market was catered for with its headline: “Ben Stokes was out, so third Test heroics should not have counted”. Close your eyes and you can just about imagine a nine-year-old child conjuring such a line after an unfavourable call in a backyard cricket game. Is that the age of Australia’s collective conscience? It’s hard to say, though what is more sure is the uptick in online traffic from the UK this headline will garner.Former Test captain Allan Border meanwhile was more inward-looking and rued Australia’s use of the DRS. “The one time where the review was there to be taken for the right reason and to win the Test match, we’ve run out of reviews because of stupidity earlier on,” Border told Fox Sports. “It’s come back to bite us badly. Our use of the review system has been appalling in this series in particular.”As the various stages of national anguish progress, there will doubtless be more hand-wringing, more finger-pointing, and more reminders of the importance of perspective. And for some, solace can be found in the fact there are two remaining Tests. As Fairfax’s Malcolm Knox submitted: “The 2019 Ashes has had too many twists to be settled halfway. The difference between the teams is not so great that Australia could retain the urn so soon.“And so to Old Trafford,” he writes, wisely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a0b726c0e6ec94b9551838e07924d7b61a597d/0_99_2093_1255/master/2093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d56ec5795aab100a99960c0b04facea6","title":"beryl burton liquorice allsorts shake up cycling","story":"Beryl Burton had a simple motto. “Anything lads can do,” she told herself, “I can do.” And then she got on her bike and showed the world the truth of her assertion through achievements that provided an early sign of what we now believe to be true: that in endurance events, whether cycling or open-water swimming or ultra-marathon running, the gap between men and women decreases as the distance grows.Between the ages of 19 and 39 the Yorkshirewoman won enough cups and medals to fill a house. They included two world road race championships, five world pursuit titles, 72 national time trial championships at distances from 10 to 100 miles, 12 national road race titles and a further dozen national pursuit titles. As a record breaker in time trials at all distances, she was beyond compare. Most of her national records lasted 20 years one stood for half a century.When it came to showing she could compete with “lads”, one incident has entered into legend. In September 1967 she made the short journey from her home in Morley, south of Leeds, to take part in the 12-hour time trial run by Otley cycling club. She was 30, and at her peak. The male competitors were due to start first, at one-minute intervals, followed by the handful of women. Among the men, the final starter was Mike McNamara, who was on his way to the coveted title of best British all-rounder.During his description of the event in The Greatest, his biography of Burton, my colleague William Fotheringham records her list of the food she prepared for a ride that started just after seven o’clock in the morning and ended an hour before sunset: “fruit salad, peaches, rice pudding, fruit and honey cake, egg and milk, peppermint and blackcurrant, coffee, glucose, malt bread, bananas, four bits of steak and some cheese”. Most of this was loaded into the support car driven by her husband, Charlie, who, having introduced her to cycling when she was in her teens, acted throughout her career in a purely supporting role that not all men – particularly, perhaps, in the Yorkshire of 50 years ago – would find easy to accept.Burton’s list does not include what became perhaps the most famous bit of food – if you can call it that – in the history of British cycling. Having completed 235 miles, still with almost two hours to go, she overhauled McNamara, who had started two minutes ahead of her and had been trying to keep her at bay, which meant repressing an urgent need to pee. As she went past, in a rather ambiguous gesture of consolation, she passed him a liquorice allsort. At that point he finally gave in to the need to climb off and empty his bladder.Earlier in the day Burton had suffered a persistent stomach ache, relieved only when Charlie drove up alongside and offered her a nip of brandy. In the final hour she allowed McNamara to repass her and sat safely 100 yards or so behind him until the end of her 12 hours by which time she had covered 277.25 miles outdistancing McNamara by almost half a mile and setting a record for all-comers, men or women. A woman had beaten all the men in a major endurance event while competing against them in exactly the same conditions.The time trial was Burton’s thing and the only reason she never won the world time trial championship is that it wasn’t there to be won. By the time the governing body finally decided to allow women to race against the clock for a world title, her career was long over. It was the same with the Olympics: when women cyclists were finally admitted to the Games in 1984, she was 47 years old – although that did not prevent her from hoping vainly for a place in the British team.Beneath the image of a straightforward Yorkshire lass, Burton was a complicated person: strong willed and obsessively competitive. At 11, having just endured the blow of unexpectedly failing the exam that would have secured her a grammar school place, she had suffered severe complications from rheumatic fever, keeping her in hospital for nine months and convalescent for a further year. It was not until her new boyfriend got her on a bike that she found her means of self-expression, one that justified the years of maintaining her strength through hard toil on a rhubarb farm.The most moving and troubling passages of the book concern her relationship with her daughter, Denise, who followed her into cycling. On the day the 20-year-old beat her mother to win the national road race title in 1976, the pain of defeat was so strong that Beryl could not bring herself to congratulate her daughter. Six years later, however, they were sharing a British 10-mile tandem record.At the end of September the world’s best cyclists will gather in Yorkshire, competing for the women’s and men’s rainbow jerseys over roads Beryl Burton knew well. Having set an example that advanced the cause of women in sport, she died in 1996 while out on her bike delivering invitations to her 59th birthday party the heart attack that killed her may have had its origins in her childhood illness.“She was well known but no one truly knew her,” Fotheringham writes he is a knowledgeable and sympathetic storyteller but the reader is left with the feeling there are layers still waiting to be peeled away, if time has not sealed them permanently together.The Greatest: The Times and Life of Beryl Burton is published by YouCaxton (£20)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f05884a36314983948e4af66b3b17d91d3c75d/714_105_5736_3441/master/5736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9035215d90c62d65649d0fbfd6fa1c02","title":"a brutally honest evening with mel b review scary spicy and surreal","story":"Grand theatre, LeedsThe Spice Girl’s spoken-word show s her chaotic life story and provides a compelling look at superstardom’s human costThis show is billed as “brutally honest” so let’s be brutally honest. Mel B’s audience isn’t full – although neither is it the sales disaster that has seen tabloid speculation that two spoken-word performances will lose her £57,000. She also refutes press reports that she is “unemployed and broke”. However, there’s certainly a story in how working-class teenager Melanie Brown became a Spice Girls superstar and is now a 44-year old mother back home in Leeds, living with her mum.Things turn from surreal to compelling when Brown discusses her 10-year marriage, which she claims was “coercive, abusive and violent”. (Her former husband, Stephen Belafonte, disputes her allegations.) She is incisive on the incremental power of a controlling male and talks about why she had a tattoo of her ex-husband’s name physically cut from her body (she keeps it in a jar). Her tearful video diaries from the marriage are harrowing.A woman gets up from the audience to thank Brown for championing LGBT rights and proposes to her girlfriend on stage, and we haven’t even reached the interval yet. Second-half subjects career from suicide attempts to how her father’s death gave her the push to finally leave Belafonte. She discusses her televised claim to Piers Morgan that she once had sex with Geri Horner (which Ginger Spice denies), explains why she bought a goat and howls: “Stop stealing my show!” at Cookie, who is dancing on hind legs.The show ends with Brown bickering comically with “Mother” (“What’s this about us buying chickens?”) and dancing with her family to I Will Survive. It’s far too long, but somewhere in the chaos is a powerful insight into superstardom’s human cost and what it means to gain, surrender and determinedly rediscover girl power.• At the Savoy theatre, London, on 1 September.

Or just more acts pinning their colours to that mast? A common claim – flogged to death by the conservative commentariat – is that comedy is dominated by a “liberal elite”. That was always a tenuous premise: beyond the late Jeremy Hardy, the Marks Steel and Thomas, and mid-career Josie Long, where are all these socialist clowns we keep hearing about? But it’s looking even more ragged now. Since journeyman standup Geoff Norcott had the bright idea of relaunching himself as a Tory and became a fixture on Question Time, other acts have followed suit. Anti-woke is the fringe pose du jour, not infrequently struck by comics out and proud about their rightwing affiliations.They draw their charge – such as it is – from the conceit that they’re fearlessly flouting tyrannical orthodoxy. But the idea that it’s Transgressive – the title of Scottish comic Leo Kearse’s show – to PC-bash in public is a bit of a stretch. Ricky Gervais, Dave Chappelle, Jimmy Carr: comedy arenas are full of this stuff. You can’t open the papers or turn on TV without hearing anti-woke and pro-Brexit sentiment. If – as these comics insist – free speech is under attack, it’s a pretty feeble attack. Although it did succeed in having Kearse’s previous show, Right-Wing Comedian, cancelled in Australia last year after protests about its alleged transphobia.Perhaps that’s why “we’re afraid of saying the wrong thing these days”, as Konstantin Kisin puts it. Kisin made the headlines last year by refusing to perform at a London university after being asked to sign a “behavioural agreement” relating to the content of his act. (He doesn’t mention that the organiser swiftly apologised.) He raises some legitimate questions in a show exploring why 3,300 people were arrested in the UK last year for things they said on social media.He also contradicts himself. We mustn’t call people we disagree with Nazis, he says – then ends with a George Carlin quote equating political correctness with fascism. The politics of Dominic Frisby’s show Libertarian Love Songs (Frisby is standing as a prexit Party candidate for parliament) are likewise all over the place. Ukulele in hand, he sings that “all taxation is theft”, then criticises Amazon for not paying its taxes. He criticises the ubiquitous blandness of modern Britain, then croons a hymn to Wetherspoons.But the show has its charms. Frisby emerges more as contrarian English eccentric than reactionary. His rant about “crony capitalism”, and the sweet ending to his song about hate speech, both suggest common ground between Frisby’s anti-corporate shtick and the politics of the bolshiest social justice warrior of rightwing demonology.Time was, of course, progressive fringe audiences might have rejected even a whiff of Toryism in their comedy. Only five years ago, Jim Davidson felt like an outlier here – although he played in a major venue and was widely reviewed. But we’re all more mindful of ersity and inclusion these days – and rightist comics are cashing in on the affirmative action. Kisin, Kearse and Frisby’s shows were well attended on my visits, and fair enough: they can be entertaining, and put forward the occasional intelligent point of view. Not so Titania McGrath, the fictional Twitter avatar of comedian Andrew Doyle – now incarnated at the fringe by comic Alice Marshall. Fitfully amusing online, McGrath is a crude caricature on stage, a mean-spirited and largely witless burlesque of millennial wokeness.The show’s presiding idea is that the left is building a gulag out of PC terminology and ever-changing gender pronouns. Spoiler alert: that isn’t true. But there are pertinent conversations to have – and jokes to make – about where we draw the lines around offensive and illegal, between acceptable jokes and hateful acts. Kisin wonders how the defence of free speech became “a far-right dog whistle”, and it’s a good question. It’s traditionally a progressive cause, and some of the best comedy in Edinburgh on wokeness and new sensitivities around language are from leftwing comics – like Ahir Shah, say, with his routine on the phrase “people of colour” (“as if I’m indistinguishable from a black woman”).If there’s debate around whether woke-bashing is an exclusively rightwing pursuit, there’s none around the Tory credentials of Sarah Southern’s show on the Free Fringe. Southern was the Conservative aide who resigned in 2012 after the so-called “cash for access” scandal. Now she’s doing standup about her love of Mrs Thatcher, her time in David Cameron’s employ and her fall from grace. The promised interrogation of where she now stands politically never quite materialises, beyond a lame disavowal of the actual record of the government she helped precipitate. (“Some of their policies don’t sit well with me”)But if hers is a low-wattage show, it’s not objectionable. Nor does it – or any of the shows mentioned – herald a new rightward direction for standup. There may be those who consider rightwing comedy oxymoronic because comedy mustn’t punch down, and punching down is what rightwingery is all about. But there have always been comics who do that, or who trade in chauvinist stereotypes, or promote inidualist values. (As Leo Kearse points out: standup is the ne plus ultra Thatcherite industry.) Kearse, Frisby and co are just the latest in their line. All that’s changed – after Norcott banished the stigma, and advertised the career benefits, of calling oneself rightwing – is the branding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

Bisected by the River Mersey, they are home to at least 67 species of birds, and the rare Daubenton’s bat. During the second world war, mock housing and factory buildings were built of plywood on Turn Moss as decoys to distract German bombers from nearby factories.

We picnic or grab a coffee from the lorry parked on site. I often join the Saturday park run or use the outdoor gym. Visitors can tour the parliament buildings free of charge and have lunch in the members’ dining room between noon and 2pm.

It was a maternity home during the 1960s and 1970s, and many locals were born there (including me). The house was bequeathed to the people of Dumbarton, but for many years lay in a sad state of disrepair until it was let to a Christian organisation. It runs a tea room on Saturdays (and Thursdays and Fridays in summer). You can walk around the gorgeous grounds or, if you’re feeling more energetic, go up into the Lang Craigs wood for fabulous views. Then relax and enjoy your coffee and cake in the Angel Room watched over by the heavenly frescoes.• visitscotlandCarol Ann RamsayWatchtree Nature Reserve, near Carlisle, offers walks in dense woodland populated with hare and deer, as well as frogs, toads and newts, if you look carefully enough. Sited on a former second world war airfield, it has a number of trails through the woods, as well as smooth track perfect for cycling or skating. It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas. Given that is was once the burial ground for thousands of animals caught up in the foot-and-mouth crisis, its transformation into to a nature reserve, wind farm and disability cycling charity is a serene triumph.• watchtreeJames CartwrightHengistbury Head, just south of Christchurch, is a beautiful, tranquil and constantly changing piece of coastline that has something for everyone. As a newly created dog walker, I can choose from flat grassland tracks that lead to high sand dunes down to the beautiful natural and often deserted beach. Or we can choose to go high on to the head and walk the path through heather and ferns, with views of Christchurch Priory and estuary on one side, and the Dorset coastline on the other. Then, right at the tip, you see Mudeford Spit and its beach huts. There is wildlife and colourful plant life everywhere, and whether it’s sunny or cloudy (it’s always windy!) at the end of a walk you feel better for having been there.• see visithengistburyheadPhilippaBaggeridge Country Park, near Wolverhampton, has always been our family’s favourite place for an afternoon walk. It’s a former colliery with beautiful walks, a play park, a miniature railway, lakes and watercress beds to hop across. It’s often heaving on a warm day, so our best memories are in the drizzle when it’s quiet and we can watch the wildfowl on Bag Pool, or walk to Himley Hall and stop for hot chocolate. You often spot relics of the old mine works and can climb to the toposcope and look across to the old brickworks. A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children’s play areas and – on a clear day – views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells.

(James Morton, adorable Scotsman, series three.) In the 10 years since a show about a disparate bunch of amateur bakers measuring out flour and whimsy in a countryside tent was commissioned by the BBC, more not-great British stuff has happened than in many other peacetime decades combined.Bake Off was born into a country reeling from its first hung parliament since the 1970s. It turns 10 as the UK prepares to crash out of the EU without a deal. In between, lots of other nasty things have been stuffed, like an inedible victoria sandwich baked in hate. What I am really wondering, while being waylaid by extended cake metaphors in the grand tradition of #GBBO reportage, is whether The Great British Bake Off is all that is left of what’s great and British in this country?Everyone has their own theory as to why the show has been such an unprecedented global success. For some, it is Bake Off’s magical ability to induce the warm contentment, sprinkled with mild hysteria, of eating cake. For others, it is the unbridled joy of a lion made out of bread by a prison governor. It combines the bunting-encircled days of the village hall fete with an irresistible, if concocted, vision of modern, erse, harmonious Britain. In fact, The Great British Bake Off may be the last acceptable form of nostalgia in the UK.In preparation for the 10th series, why not smooth on a few more layers of wistfulness with our rundown of the best moments from the past nine …There is a wonky charm to these six homespun episodes. In the first, Mark Whithers’ marmalade tea loaf sank in the middle because he kept opening the oven door to check on it. “You put your heart and soul into this,” said Sue Perkins, as he burst into tears. She straightened his tie. Gave him a little pat. “I’m ready for the next challenge,” he said shakily. “Which will probably be a saltwater cake, unless you dry those peepers,” Sue gently teased. A prototype pep-talk containing all the ingredients of Bake Off’s future success: pathos, humour, a rounded teaspoon of melancholia, and words like “peepers”.Remember when Robert Billington became the first twee heartthrob in the tent? All boyband hair and clumsy puppy paws. But even the sight of Bake Off’s own Captain Poldark dropping his chocolate genoise mousse cake couldn’t compete with a squirrel’s enorma-balls in the final. It was the equivalent of that lingering shot of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy eyeing each other up over a piano in Andrew Davies’s Pride and Prejudice. Subtle, subversive and deeply naughty.This was when Bake Off began to quietly scale the meringue-peaked heights of greatness. Brendan Lynch greasing up his arms to stretch his dough! John Whaite confusing salt and sugar in a technical round, causing Paul Hollywood to retch over his rum babas! James Morton’s Fair Isle knits! But no, the winner must be Cathryn Dresser. In episode six, Hollywood’s advice to “build up the resistance” of strudel dough by grabbing, twisting, slapping and tossing it until you win virile baker of the year at the county fair was taken too enthusiastically by Cathryn, who catapulted hers to the floor. “It’s so hairy!” she laughed. “I’m not serving Mary Berry green carpet.”The controversial one, and not just because Sue elbowed Howard’s muffins. This was the series in which Ruby Tandoh – in the top five contestants of all time for her technical skill in folding bad attitude into false modesty – was accused of being favoured by Hollywood. Which turned out to just be vintage misogyny. Best moment, however, goes to #Custardgate, in which Howard became a victim of theft after Deborah used his crème anglaise in her trifle. Was it, to quote Sue, “the most incredible case of baking espionage” ever seen? Whatever, he ended up a national hero. This may seem insane now, but #Bingate (a bolder, richer #Custardgate, do keep up) was actual front-page news. To attempt to boil this complex saga down to its essence is as pointless as tweeting the plot of Game of Thrones, but, basically, Diana Beard removed Iain Watters’ baked alaska from the freezer. He had a tantrum, threw it in the bin and stormed out of the tent. Then he came back, presented the bin to the judges and was duly voted off. That’s actually it. Anyway, 800 people complained to Ofcom, Iain appeared on Newsnight and Diana’s doctor got involved. Lessons learned: we really didn’t have much to worry about then, did we?Winner of not just series six, but every Bake Off past and future, the nation’s heart and anything worth dying on a hill for, is Nadiya Hussain. Her facial expressions were gif gold. Her levitating-can showstopper was a metaphysical masterpiece. She was funny, wise, self-deprecating and always magnificently herself. She showed us what Britishness, at its best, could be. And her victory speech was so moving it made everyone, including Mary Berry, cry. “I can and I will” is all I need to reprise here to bring it back in its full Larkin-esque glory.The best moment in the series touted at the time to be Bake Off’s last goes to Selasi Gbormittah or, as he came to be known, the king of chill. He baked from the floor a yogi practising shivasana while checking on his savarins. He referred to puff pastry as “puff”. He did bump ’n’ grind rolling pin moves for Benjamina Ebuehi. Baking never got cooler than Selasi saying to Mel Giedroyc, when she observed smoke billowing from his dampfnudel, that “it’s the kind of burn that you like”.The move to Channel 4 shocked, in the mild and comforting way only Bake Off can, by remaining exactly the same. This was no season six, but what it lacked in Nadiyas it made up for in fiendishly clever bakes. What could top Steven’s chess set made out of a hundred inidual biscuit elements, each one purpose-baked to achieve checkmate? It even sharp-elbowed his own manchego clutch with breadstick chain out of the limelight. Actually, Steven was so good the palette knives came out. Let’s face it, there is no greater crime in reality TV – apart from sabotaging someone’s baked alaska – than being too good to be true.“I’m not confident with anything happening around my life … so how can the baking temperature be different?” With this profound ululation of self-effacement, the Eeyore of Bake Off shuffled into our lives. Rahul Mandal, an Indian research scientist who, in the best possible way, looked like a baby moulded by Aardman Animations, confessed he baked to make friends. He had only made his first cake two years earlier and, in his day job, continued to do “first-rate research using lasers”. Can you even imagine 2018 without Rahul? It would be as drab and joyless as a world without cake.

Nestled in the mountains in the Portuguese interior, this pretty town has suffered a familiar kind of slow-motion decline.“Once the factories started closing, then the schools closed, the shops closed, even the chapel closed,” says Maria José Santos Salvado, a wizard with needle and thread who was laid off as a textile patcher when her factory shut in 2011. “All the young people left. Manteigas became a town of old people.”It’s a common enough story in southern Europe, where rural decline is a long-term tendency that has accelerated since the financial crisis.But are fortunes about to reverse for people like Salvado? After the surprise intervention of a husband-and-wife team from Lisbon, the looms of her old factory are chugging noisily once again. With orders streaming in from as far afield as Japan, her deft skills are in higher demand than ever.Isabel Costa, formerly a high-flyer in Portugal’s corporate retail sector, and her lawyer husband, João, are among a small but growing number of investors turning their eye to Portugal’s rural interior.In many parts of Europe, the issue of depopulation of the countryside, regions, or in some cases whole countries, weighs on the minds of politicians and the public, as an era of freedom of movement means more people are able to migrate to find better opportunities.A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed that in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, countries where the population has either declined sharply or is flatlining, more people are worried about emigration than they are about immigration.The problem is felt acutely in central and eastern Europe, where populations have shrunk dramatically in the decades since the fall of communism, due in part to the traumatic effects of the transition, with high mortality rates, low birth rates, and millions of people travelling to western Europe to seek higher salaries, especially in the years after EU accession. In Bulgaria, for example, the population has shrunk from 9 million to 7 million since 1989.“More and more people are investing in the interior of Portugal … but they need to look at these projects almost as a kind of mission, not as a way of getting rich,” advises Costa.This is true of her own venture, which, despite growing year-on-year, was never designed to be a major money-spinner. Indeed, its origins were more coincidental than commercial. Costa had placed an order with a local manufacturer for burel wool – a historical speciality of Portugal’s mountainous Serra da Estrela region.She quickly discovered that the manufacturer was in a “bad situation” and agreed to buy its working looms and its back catalogue of patterns. She rented a disused factory space owned by the local council, re-hired 15 of the firm’s employees, and restarted operations. With some luck (Microsoft hired her to refit its Lisbon headquarters) and plenty of hard work (she spends half the year travelling to trade shows), Costa’s Burel Mountain Originals brand now employs more than 60 people and supplies two high-end stores in Lisbon and Porto.“We couldn’t just sit back and see this incredible heritage destroyed. I couldn’t sleep knowing about this problem and doing nothing to retain the area’s industrial history and to teach the next generation,” says Costa, who also owns two boutique mountain hotels close to Manteigas.Catarina Vieira is of a similar mind. A former finance manager from the coastal city of Aveiro, she owns a modest six-chalet quinta, or estate, near the town of Seia and is a vocal proponent of Portugal’s nascent eco-tourism market.Chao do Rio is the polar opposite of the vast, package-holiday complexes that now litter the Algarve. The food she serves is all locally sourced, the swimming pool is “biological” (read: unchlorinated and teeming with frogs), and the only loud music you will hear is the sound of birdsong.“The whole idea behind projects like ours is that they are on a small scale and they show concern for the environment and social awareness,” says Vieira. Her vision of a small-scale, culturally-sensitive mode of development is shared by many of those investing in Portugal’s interior. Like Bruno Vargas. A 41-year-old former marketeer, he jacked in his city job five years ago to run a four-hectare farm in Rio Maior, a village located in the Centro region. His venture, Herbas Organic Herbs, specialises in hand-crafted aromatic tea infusions. Business is good. He exports to various European countries and employs seasonal labour from the local area. By his own admission, however, the venture grew out of the “romantic idea” of a more balanced lifestyle as much as turning a profit.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“I had the idea that it would be a different kind of life, with more time for my family and less pressures. That’s not turned out to be true, of course. If you have a business, you have pressures, but at least my mind is clearer about why I’m doing this,” he says. Not all embrace this pared-down model of rural development. The Portuguese government provides warm words, for instance, but little in the shape of financial support. Such public investment as exists for rural enterprise development tends to come from the European Union.To get started, for example, Vargas received €40,000 (£37,000) in seed-funding from ProDer – a nationally-managed fund for rural development primarily financed by the EU. Costa and Vieira also received help from the same fund. Even less sympathetic are large-scale investors, for whom big is – as ever – beautiful. Despite being located in an officially designated natural park, for instance, Manteigas is soon to have a huge, luxury hotel constructed in the wooded glacial valley overlooking the town.In a similar vein, international mining firms are now sniffing around. It transpires that Portugal’s central belt is especially “blessed” with reserves of lithium, the alkali metal used in batteries for smartphones and electric cars. “If mega-mining comes to the centre of Portugal, it will spoil everything. We really need to cherish these small projects and put away these crazy dreams of Portugal as the future Arabia,” says Vieira.The economists would disagree, arguing that mega-mining and commercial tourism promise far higher levels of capital investment and job creation. The central government, which campaigners fear is poised to greenlight a lithium mine on the edge of Serra da Estrela, appears to agree.From his holistic yoga retreat near Tábua, in the district of Coimbra, Tony Speirs is watching with anxiety. Originally from north Wales, he set up shop in central Portugal a decade ago. Over that time, he has seen large-scale commercial investment completely alter the once sleepy coastline of the Algarve. He hopes his neighbours will take note and opt for a different route. As he himself readily admits, micro-enterprises like his will not transform Portugal’s rustic interior into dynamos of economic development. But they are helping spark into life pockets of entrepreneurial vitality. For Speirs, that’s enough. His neighbours, he says, are of like mind: “Here, people think once your business is working, why grow it?” Why, indeed?This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The new city would replace the crowded, polluted megacity of Jakarta, which is slowly sinking into the sea.The capital of the world’s fourth most populous country, on the island of Java, is home to 10 million people and is prone to floods and traffic gridlock and faces the risk of earthquakes.The as-yet-unnamed new capital would straddle the regions of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara in Indonesia’s province of East Kalimantan on Borneo, the president, Joko Widodo, told a news conference on Monday. It is expected to cost 466tn rupiah (£27bn).“It is a strategic location at the centre of Indonesia, close to growing urban areas,” Widodo said at the presidential palace in Jakarta, adding that planning must start immediately if relocation is to begin in 2024.The site of the new capital, 1,250 miles (2,000km) north-east of Jakarta, is one of the regions least prone to the natural disasters that regularly hit the archipelago of 17,000 islands.But environmentalists fear the move will hasten the destruction of forests that are home to orangutans, sun bears and long-nosed monkeys, as well as increasing pollution already on the rise from the coalmining and palm oil industries.“The move will have an environmental impact,” said the Greenpeace senior forest campaigner, Jasmine Puteri. “Jakarta has suffered so many failures from pollution, water crisis, and flooding. We don’t want these problems in the new capital.”Officials say they want the new capital to be “a smart city in the forest” and have set aside 180,000 hectares (445,000 acres) of government land.Kutai Kartanegara and North Penajam Paser have a population of about 900,000 people, out of the total population of 3.5 million in East Kalimantan.News of the move was welcomed by the developers’ association in the province, which said it expected a bump in investment. But national business groups were more cautious.“Investors will need to see what the return on their investment would be,” Hariyadi Sukamdani, the chairman of the Indonesian employers association, told Reuters.The Indonesian chamber of commerce deputy chair Shinta Kamdani hailed the new capital as a “positive” for Indonesia, but said companies should be informed of the timeline for the move of each government office to limit disruptions.Indonesia is not the first south-east Asian country to move its capital.In 2005, Myanmar’s ruling generals moved to Naypyidaw, a town in hills 200 miles away from the colonial-era capital, Yangon. In the 1990s, the Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad built an administrative capital in Putrajaya, about 20 miles from Kuala Lumpur.Widodo said the government would soon submit a bill and the result of a feasibility study to parliament to secure approval for the new capital, a measure that analysts expect will be passed quickly.The planning minister, Bambang Brodjonegoro, said land acquisition would start next year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3997040.1566766613!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney welcomes consistent eu support for brexit backstop","story":"The European Union expects Britain to honour all financial obligations made during its membership of the bloc, even after a no-deal Brexit, according to European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.

Photograph: Neil HallEPAThe Government has welcomed the EU’s continued support for the Irish backstop following the first substantive meeting between UK prime minister Boris Johnson and European Council president Donald Tusk on Brexit.“Mr Tusk set out once again the EU’s clear and consistent position which we share,” a spokesman for Tánaiste Simon Coveney said on Sunday night following the meeting in the margins of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France.“The EU remains open to any new ideas from the United Kingdom so long as they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement.”Government sources said the leaders of major European countries and institutions that Mr Johnson has met in the past week – German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Emmanuel Macron and Mr Tusk – have been consistent with the message that the withdrawal agreement cannot be revisited and any UK suggestions for change would occur during the next phase of the Brexit process: the declaration on future relations.The 25-minute meeting between Mr Tusk and Mr Johnson was described as cordial and positive, but sources said it involved no fresh proposals but rather a restating of the positions on both sides.The atmosphere between the two was in contrast to the previous day, when they accused each other of being responsible for the fact a no-deal Brexit is looming on October 31st.‘Mr No Deal’Mr Tusk had said he hoped Mr Johnson would “not like to go down in history as ‘Mr No Deal’” and that the “EU is ready to listen to operational, realistic ideas acceptable to all member states including Ireland, if and when the UK government is ready to put them on the table”.Mr Johnson struck conflicting tones in a series of interviews on Sunday. At one point he said there had been a change of mood and that the chances of a deal were improving, but he also told the BBC the prospect of a crash-out exit remained “touch-and-go”.“It all depends on our EU friends and partners. I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK,” he said, adding that “the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal”.The EU briefed that the onus was squarely on the UK to come up with an alternative to the backstop. Mr Johnson has said he will not negotiate with the EU on Brexit unless it agrees to remove the backstop, which guarantees continuation of a seamless border on the island of Ireland.Divorce billHe also raised the prospect of the UK refusing to pay the so-called £39 billion (€43 billion) Brexit orce bill in the event of a no-deal outcome.Speaking on ITV, Mr Johnson said: “If we come out without an agreement it is certainly true that the £39 billion is no longer, strictly speaking, owed.“There will be very substantial sums available to our country to spend on our priorities. It is not a threat. It is a simple fact.”Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said Britain would find it very difficult in future to strike any trade deal with the EU if it reneged on the orce bill. She also argued that the Government must step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit and called on Mr Coveney to clarify where checks would occur in the event of the UK crashing out of the bloc.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Allison JoyceGettyRusting behind barbed wire, rows of trailers at a repatriation centre sit empty and uninviting, evocative of a prison awaiting its inmates. In a deserted arrivals trailer, uniformed officers loiter at their desks, expectant grins on their faces. Signs explain the steps involved in welcoming Rohingya Muslims back to Myanmar: Stand here for photographs, go there for identity cards.Men stand guard with security wands, as if this were an international airport rather than an inhospitable holding pen in a desolate frontier. What is so obviously missing at the Nga Khu Ya repatriation centre are the Rohingya themselves.Ever since more than 730,000 Rohingya started fleeing to Bangladesh, two years ago on Sunday, to escape a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing, governments from both countries have repeatedly vowed that a return of the Muslim minority to Myanmar was imminent.But that promise has been broken, time and again. The Rohingya have not returned by the hundreds of thousands or even by the thousands. In fact, they have hardly come back at all. After all the assurances that it was safe for them to return to Myanmar, only a few dozen have done so.The first batch of about 1,200 returnees was supposed to be sent home in January 2018. That plan was delayed by the Bangladeshi government after an international outcry over the idea of returning traumatised victims to the centre of one of the worst eruptions of ethnic cleansing this century.After the two countries promised in April 2018 to proceed with safe, voluntary and dignified repatriations, several new deadlines were set. None was met. Most recently, the Myanmar government said the repatriation of 3,450 Rohingya would begin on Thursday last. That target, too, passed with no movement across the border.Maintaining the fiction that repatriations are about to occur is politically useful for both sides. Myanmar, which United Nations officials say should be tried on genocide charges over the orchestrated killings that began August 25th, 2017, is keen to prove it is not a human rights pariah.Bangladesh, struggling with overpopulation and poverty, wants to reassure its citizens that scarce funds are not being erted to refugees. But the charade at Nga Khu Ya, with its corroded buildings devoid of any Rohingya presence, proves the lie in the repatriation commitment. The place is so quiet that a dog snoozes at the main entrance, undisturbed.Even the repatriation centre’s watchtowers are empty of soldiers. There is no one to watch.Tragicomic scriptThe lack of returnees on Thursday followed the same tragicomic script as previous efforts to get the Rohingya home. First, Myanmar unilaterally announced a date for repatriation, but approved the return of only a tiny fraction of those eligible.Bangladesh, the Muslim-majority nation where most of the Rohingya have sought refuge, then said it supported the idea. “I’m very positive,” foreign affairs minister AK Abdul Momen told reporters in early August. “I’m expecting that we can start this month.”But the Rohingya – hundreds of thousands of whom are squeezed into overflowing camps in Bangladesh – baulked, having received scant consultation about their own futures. Not a single Rohingya boarded the five buses and two trucks that were prepared on Thursday to transfer them over the border to Myanmar.International human rights groups stepped in to urge caution about returning anyone, having interviewed Rohingya who were terrified, not joyful, to learn that they were on the repatriation list.On Thursday, Radhika Coomaraswamy, an expert with the UN fact-finding mission on the Myanmar violence, said conditions were not conducive for the return of Rohingya. “We have been shown satellite imagery which shows the situation in northern Rakhine, which is basically where all the villages have been bulldozed, not a tree standing,” she said at a news conference at the UN headquarters in New York.That left Myanmar with the perfect opportunity to declare itself surprised that the Rohingya were not coming back. “I have no idea why repatriation has not happened yet,” said Win Myint, a spokesman for the government in Rakhine state, which Myanmar’s Rohingya once called home. “Everything is ready on our side.”This scenario has played out before, with similarly hollow outcomes. In November, Win Myat Aye, Myanmar’s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, told the New York Times that a round of repatriation would begin within a couple of days. Over a 15-day period, 2,165 people would be processed through Nga Khu Ya repatriation camp, he promised. Then, soon after, another 5,000 and so on.“They can apply for citizenship,” Myat Aye said. “They can live in the place where they’re originally from. If there is no housing there, they can live near where they’re from.”The government’s own facts indicate this is a fantasy. According to Myanmar immigration authorities’ figures, from May 2018 to May 2019 only 185 Rohingya were repatriated from Bangladesh. Even that tiny number is inflated. Of those 185 people, 92 had been caught by authorities in Myanmar while trying to escape the country by boat. Sixty-two others had just been released from jails in Myanmar.Minuscule numbersOnly 31 Rohingya – of the nearly three-quarters of a million who left Myanmar – had returned “of their own volition”, according to the government. When pressed to account for such minuscule numbers, Myanmar authorities accuse Rohingya militants and Muslim charities operating in the refugee camps in Bangladesh of dissuading people from going back.“Muslim terrorists in the camps say that it is not safe to return, so people don’t dare,” said Soe Aung, head of the General Administration Department in Maungdaw, a township in Rakhine that was once overwhelmingly Rohingya, “even though it’s totally safe.”Assurances that Myanmar has laid out the welcome mat have come from none other than Aung San Suu Kyi, de facto head of the civilian government and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. “The state counsellor already decided to receive back the people who lived in Myanmar and left the country for some reason,” said Myat Aye, referring to Suu Kyi by her formal title. “There is no reason not to come back.”But the Rohingya’s dread about what might await them is understandable, given what drove their flight in the first place – and what has happened, and not happened, in Myanmar since the exodus.After a band of Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army encampment August 25th, 2017, a burst of brutality against the Muslim minority followed within hours: mass executions, rape and the burning of hundreds of villages by security forces. Buddhist mobs participated in the bloodletting.Aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières says that at least 6,700 Rohingya met violent deaths in the month after the killings began. While the Myanmar government defended its actions as “clearance operations” targeting only militants, the large build-up of troops in the weeks before the attack – and the military helicopters that rained down rockets on villagers in the days afterward – suggest a highly co-ordinated, long-planned campaign of ethnic cleansing that had been waiting for the right catalysing event.The Rohingya who escaped to Bangladesh now live in a teeming, squalid settlement – the world’s largest refugee encampment. Human trafficking is rife, with girls destined for brothels and men for indentured servitude in southeast Asia. When the monsoons descend on the camps, sewage and mud mix into a disease-breeding brew. Landslides are common, and Rohingya have even been killed by rampaging elephants. There is little, if any, incentive to stay.But despite these intolerable conditions, Myanmar looks worse to many refugees, who are bewildered at the idea that they should return to a country whose government has refused to admit that atrocities were committed.“How can we believe those who killed our nearest and dearest?” said Ramjan Ali, sole survivor of a family that was massacred in the village of Tula Toli.Those Rohingya who stayed in northern Rakhine state after the killing began are marooned in communities cut off from jobs, education and basic services. Since June, the region’s mobile internet connection has been severed. Incarceration rates among Rohingya men are high, with many accused of terrorist activity.ParadedThose released from jail are sometimes paraded as repatriated Rohingya, even if they have never left Myanmar. “I miss my home a lot,” said Saiful Islam, a Rohingya leader in the camps in Bangladesh. “But I don’t want to go back to a place where my family could be killed.”Any Rohingya who did return to Myanmar would find a transformed landscape. Drive across the salty marsh of northern Rakhine, and the silence is overwhelming. About one million Rohingya once lived in this area. Now most are gone, the occasional carcass of a burned mosque or stand of charred palms the only evidence that they existed.The government has funnelled money into infrastructure development in Rakhine: new power stations, government buildings and, most of all, military and border guard bases. But many of those new facilities have been built on land emptied by ethnic cleansing.Analysis of satellite imagery by the International Cyber Policy Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that nearly 60 Rohingya settlements were razed last year, well after the violence peaked in 2017. Destruction of Rohingya villages continued into this year, the study found.Officials in Myanmar have never been clear about where, exactly, returnees would live – even as they showed off rows of prefabricated houses supposedly built for repatriated families. In a troubling precedent, about 120,000 Rohingya from central Rakhine state who were targeted in a 2012 conflict have been confined to internment camps for the past seven years. Their businesses have been taken over by members of Myanmar’s Buddhist majority. Most of their homes have been destroyed.As construction transforms Rakhine, bringing Buddhist pagodas to areas where the Islamic call to prayer once resounded, the beneficiaries of the building boom are companies run by cronies of the military, which still dominates the government.On August 5th, a UN fact-finding mission released a report recommending targeted sanctions against these military-linked firms, which it said had helped in “re-engineering the region in a way that erases evidence of Rohingya belonging to Myanmar”.The United Nations says no refugees should have to return to a place where their safety and security are not assured. Doing so is called refoulement, and it’s against international law. But Myanmar has done little to reassure the Rohingya that the conditions that led to the mass killings have changed.The country has steadfastly refused to admit that its security forces, which engaged in widespread sexual violence and sprayed fleeing children with gunfire, according to Rohingya testimony and investigations by human rights groups, did anything wrong.“Not a single innocent Muslim was killed,” said Soe Aung, the Maungdaw township official. Aung San Suu Kyi has declined to hold the military responsible for the violence, even as UN-appointed investigators recommended last year that commanders be investigated for crimes against humanity.Considered immigrantsDespite the fact that Myanmar clearly is their home, most Rohingya are officially considered immigrants from Bangladesh in the country illegally. And before any are accepted for repatriation, they must often come up with evidence proving that they came from Myanmar. That’s a tall order for refugees who fled burning homes.More controversially, those who wish to return must accept identity cards that critics say will make their statelessness official. Myanmar’s government does not even accept the name “Rohingya”. Instead, those who return are issued documents that identify them as Bengali, implying they are foreign interlopers from Bangladesh, not an ethnic group from Rakhine.“We are Rohingya,” whispered Abdul Kadir, an imam from a northern Rakhine village who has been unable to flee, in broken English. “No say Rohingya in Myanmar. No say.”“‘Rohingya’ is not real,” said Kyaw Kyaw Khine, deputy head of immigration at Nga Khu Ya repatriation camp. “Why do foreigners use this word?”The official narrative in Myanmar goes like this: The Rohingya burned down their own homes to garner international sympathy and to feast on plentiful aid rations in Bangladesh provided by Muslim nations. Myanmar officials also accuse Bangladeshi officials of dawdling and wonder if they are reluctant to let the Rohingya leave.“Maybe they want people to stay there,” said Kyaw Sein, an administrator at the Nga Khu Ya camp. The truth could not be more different. Bangladeshis have displayed tremendous hospitality to the Rohingya, who poured over the border in the fastest inflow of refugees in a generation. But the country’s patience has worn thin.Bangladeshi authorities keep threatening to resettle the Rohingya to an island that is little more than a cyclone-prone sandbar in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh does not consider the vast majority of Rohingya to be refugees, lest that designation cement their right to live in exile forever. As a consequence, they have no legal right to study or work outside the camps.Muslim extremists stalk camp mosques, promising salvation through militancy. Hopelessness is the only plentiful commodity. “Will my children live the rest of their lives here?” asked Islam, the Rohingya camp leader. “Is this the only life I can give them?”No one wants the Rohingya, least of all their homeland. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Donald Trump offers olive branch to China as tensions ease on final day of G7Japan\u0026#39s decision to resume commercial whaling \u0026#39disappointing\u0026#39, Boris Johnson tells country\u0026#39s prime minister at G7\u0026#39Political vacuum\u0026#39 in Kashmir after crackdown by Indian authorities No 10 dismiss claims that Boris Johnson was wrong on Melton Mowbray pies exportsUK weather: Britain basks in hottest late August Bank Holiday Monday ever as temperatures pass 28CBerlin rent cap could slash prices by more than halfBoris Johnson urges EU leaders to ignore \u0026#39very wrong\u0026#39 UK politicians planning to stop no deal BrexitFrench protesters block attempt to keep supermarket open on SundayIndonesia will move capital to island of BorneoBoy, 14, charged over suspicious fire at Dunfermline school as firefighters continue to tackle the blazeIndonesia\u0026#39s government reveals location of new capital as Jakarta sinksMet Police reveal Epstein\u0026#39s London links \u0026#39revisited\u0026#39 but insist investigation not necessaryComment: It\u0026#39s a scandal the Royal Mint refused to put Enid Blyton on a coin.

What is the ROI and outcome before you start. Is that realistic?\u0026nbsp“A lot of people think AI is going to change the world and if they plug a piece of software or application on top of what they are already doing\u0026nbsptheir business is going to transform overnight, and then end up bitterly disappointed when it isn’t,” he says.The fear stems from change. Whether it is AI or whether it is the industrial revolution – whatever the change is – that is what people fear because humans don’t really like to changeWhich is where he hopes his business can play a crucial role. Starting out as a blog written in his and his business partner’s spare time, AI Business quickly grew to become a trusted source of AI insight for business across the world by producing business-useful content, in contrast to the academic content that dominated at the time.But with his background in business event production, Pitchford was aware that for AI Business to become truly indispensable to the business community, it had to adopt a thoroughly analogue approach and bring vendors and businesses together face to face.From 400 attendees at its\u0026nbspinaugural AI Summit in London in 2016, AI Business is now the leading brand globally hosting events in London, New York, San Francisco, Munich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Cape Town. The 2019 Summit in London alone drew 25,000 AI enthusiasts.So clearly there is an appetite to understand the applications and implications of AI in the business world,\u0026nbspbut what is the destination?\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, the future of AI is about increasing productivity and that’s what politicians and governments get excited about – what can it do for our GDP? That is the big end goal,” Pitchford explains.Elon Musk’s AI project to replicate the human brain just received $1bnA 2017 report from PWC estimated that UK GDP could increase by more than 10 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030 as a result of AI, a cash equivalent of £232bn, which is no small shakes.But the UK is not the only nation eyeing the benefits of AI, with Pitchford outlining a global AI arms race between China and the US, each vying for the position of the world’s AI superpower.“A lot of people are saying China will emerge as the AI superpower. Over the last two years, Asia has overtaken Europe in terms of the amount being invested by enterprises and businesses in the adoption of AI whereas two years ago, Europe was ahead.”He says that China’s rapid emergence can be explained by the level of investment the Chinese government is putting into AI with latest estimates placing it as high as $300bn\u0026nbsp(£240bn): “As you move from innovation to implementation there is a massive opportunity which they are acutely aware of, hence the investment they are pouring in.”Such is the rate of change in AI development and implementation, it would be foolish to bet on any one nation or region becoming the dominant power just yet. But in the meantime, AI Business\u0026nbspintends to build on its own dominance in this space following its recent acquisition by publishing giant Informa.“The future is scale,” Pitchford says. “What we have with Informa is that opportunity of scale. The scale of the events and other acquisitions made by the group help that in terms of collaboration and opportunities.”And as for the allegedly demonic heart of AI? Pitchford says that proponents are acutely aware of the potential dangers and are actively addressing it.“There is a lot being invested by the big players in understanding how AI can support society rather than just generate profit,” he says.\u0026nbspSo perhaps the robot apocalypse might yet be averted by traditional human compassion.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And I’d enjoyed it.\u0026nbspI couldn’t tell you the last time that happened.\u0026nbspThis led me to ask a question: with the British town centre in crisis –\u0026nbspthe number of vacant premises at its\u0026nbsphighest level for more than four years –\u0026nbspis there anything we could learn from the place?Labour promises free wifi in town centres and scrapping ATM chargesHigh streets propose five-year plan for digital technology sales boostYou have to be a little bit careful at the outset. We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Somehow Dinan has become Breton geek central. We even found a steampunk and Harry Potter emporium.Add in the inevitable profusion of cafes, something France does so very well, and you’ve an enticing mix.\u0026nbspThe lack of the chains that have homogenised British shopping centres, and made them boring, was a big plus point for me. It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

It would certainly help if the nation could find a government willing and able to breathe it in.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Dame Caroline Spelman, the Tory former cabinet minister who led opposition to no deal under Theresa May, said she wasn’t interested and that she supported Boris Johnson’s approach.\u0026nbspNick Boles, the former Tory MP now sitting as an independent, said he couldn’t be there but urged Corbyn to focus his efforts on legislation rather than a confidence vote.\u0026nbspAnd that seems to be what a group of ministers who recently left the government are doing. Philip Hammond, Greg Clarke, David Gauke and Rory Stewart are said to be using their contacts to discuss with European leaders the length and terms of any Brexit extension.\u0026nbspThis is significant because, if the EU is prepared to grant a further extension, the most certain way of making it happen would be for the terms to be set out in advance of the EU summit on 17 October. Johnson could then be instructed by an act of parliament to accept the terms offered.\u0026nbspIt would be difficult to pass such an act against the wishes of the government, but Yvette Cooper, the Labour former cabinet minister, showed that it was possible in April, when she passed a law requiring Theresa May to seek an extension.\u0026nbspJohnson may \u0027declare no confidence in himself\u0027 to force no-deal BrexitThe weakness of that act was that it could not require the prime minister to agree to an extension, because the EU had not decided at that stage how long one should be. Hence the importance of early agreement among EU leaders on the terms.\u0026nbspAs things stand, this legislative route looks as if it is a surer way of blocking a no-deal Brexit than the idea of replacing Johnson with a caretaker prime minister. That plan involves opponents of no deal agreeing on a temporary prime minister who would negotiate an extension and preside over a general election.\u0026nbspSo far, MPs have been unable to agree who that temporary prime minister should be. Corbyn said it should be him, while Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it should be Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. Last week, Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, wrote to Corbyn saying she was prepared to support him, but “if he cannot gain the support of a sufficient number of colleagues across parliament, I hope he will be prepared to back another MP from his party, or another, who can”.\u0026nbspEven if opponents of no deal can unite behind a single candidate, however, it will be hard to muster the votes needed to force Johnson out of office. Several Tory MPs who are strongly opposed to no deal say they will not go as far as to vote for a motion of no confidence in Johnson’s government.\u0026nbspHence the intense discussions about the alternative plan of backbench legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. But, as Nick Boles says, this will take time, and, if MPs opposed to no deal are serious, they cannot afford to wait until October.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clark Mindock reports from IowaClick to followThe Independent USWith the UK facing an uncertain future as Boris Johnson marches the country towards a no-deal Brexit, American farmers can’t help but see something of a golden opportunity to bring their goods into a new market.While many US farmers have historically been turned away from trading with the UK over fears for the implications of practices such as washing chickens in chlorine, or the use of genetically modified crops, Britain’s impending exit from the EU has left some dreaming of a change to that situation.On a blistering summer day in Iowa, the idea is hard to avoid for farmers such as Leon Sheets, a pork producer from the northeast of the state who also maintains 600 acres of row crops.“Hey, let’s have the conversation. Let’s work out a deal,” Sheets says, emulating the kind of language one might expect from Donald Trump.When prodded further, Sheets acknowledges\u0026nbspthat he hopes to see a post-Brexit trade deal that would allow for the introduction of products that have previously been off the table: “That’s what the goal is – no restrictions, so products can move freely back and forth.”It is an issue that has received backing from prominent American farming executives, even if some lip service has been given to having “a conversation” about the US food standards that have worried some in the UK.Currently farming exports to Britain – including wine, nuts and fruit – are worth only about $1.8bn (£1.47bn), a fraction of the total overall sales of $133bn. That means there is potentially massive room for growth, under the right circumstances.With the US saying that the UK will be “first in line” for a trade deal following Brexit, Zippy Duvall, the head of the American Farm Bureau, recently said that they are eagerly watching for ways to begin a trade partnership – but that Britain had to accept US standards.PM warned US trade deal ‘highly unlikely’ if Ireland has hard borderGovernment finally hands firms customs numbers for post-Brexit tradeTrump vows to continue China trade war even if recession hits USAs Britain seeks new trade deals, can we learn a lesson from Poldark?UK told to accept US food standards in any trade deal“You know, here in America we treat our water with chlorine,” Duvall, a poultry farmer himself, told the BBC.He claimed it was not a public health issue, saying: “So there is no scientific basis that says that washing poultry with chlorine wash just to be safe of whatever pathogens might be on that chicken as it was prepared for the market should be taken away. If there was something wrong with it our federal inspection systems would not be allowing us to use that.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chlorine-washed bagged salads are sold in the UK and other countries in the EU, for instance.But what is of concern is that relying on chlorine washes – which proponents say makes harmful bacteria virtually undetectable – at the end of the process allows farmers to keep unsanitary conditions for the chickens earlier on. And the wash could allow for crowded abattoirs where disease could theoretically spread with greater ease.While it is tricky to compare the rates of food-borne illnesses between two countries, two separate studies would suggest that the US experiences higher rates of salmonella infection. One British government study from 2014 found that there were roughly 55 salmonella infections per 100,000 people, when analysing 2009 data. A separate study of the US found a rate of 350 infections per 100,000 people, using data from 2002-08.When it comes to deaths, the US also reports higher numbers. While the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reports around 380 deaths a year due to food-borne salmonella, England and Wales had zero such deaths between 2006 and 2015, according to the most recently available data from Public Health England.Gail Soutar, the chief European Union exit and international trade adviser for the National Farmers Union (NFU), says there was a considerable level of anxiety that a hasty and chaotic Brexit could leave UK farmers competing against a flood of international goods coming in, and undermining their prices.Soutar says she is particularly concerned at the prospect of a no-deal outcome, and the impact that subsequently high tariffs on UK agricultural products could have. Farmers, she worries, could be threatened by a flood of new goods being brought in from the US, which could undermine efforts to honour European Union standards – with the EU, for now, a much larger trading partner than the US.“There is a concern that we are going to see an increase of imports coming into the UK under a no-deal situation,” she says. “It remains absolutely key that we get a deal with the EU.”UK politicians have at least paid lip service to the notion that standards will not be abandoned in pursuit of a deal, with former environment secretary Michael Gove telling an NFU conference in\u0026nbspFebruary that they would not abandon those requirements “in pursuit of trade deals”.But thousands of miles away in Iowa, the outcome of negotiations between the UK and EU are understandably less of a concern for farmers. Whereas UK farmers may be feeling some anxiety, American farmers are clearly sensing opportunity.Bill Tenneger, a pig producer in northwest Iowa, says\u0026nbspDonald Trump’s trade war with China had been hurting farmers like him, but he thinks Mr Trump could potentially capitalise on a weak negotiating position following Brexit.But he adds\u0026nbsphe hopes\u0026nbspit would help British people out too: “I think trade agreements are good. Hey, it’s a small world. We’ve all got to get along in the world. I’ve travelled all over the world representing the pork industry.“In the end, I don’t care what culture you go to or you get embedded in, they all just want to feed their families and support their families and have the government leave them alone.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous.

This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.Then the locals can go about their business in front of, say, Greggs, and scoop it up immediately and put it in a bin.You Mackems, huh.

If Varadkar continues to insist that it’s the only deal possible, what does he think will happen We remain sceptical that the EU really has seen the light, and that they’ll finally — after three long years — negotiate in good faith.In the coming month we can still see things going pear-shaped. In which case we’ll leave with a clean break and, finally, our Government will have actually delivered on the Referendum result.It might be bumpy. But it’s what we voted for.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Remainers have no right to complain now that the tables have turned \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-e.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH BoJo cannot risk being side-tracked and humiliated by bullying Brussels \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-rod-liddle.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentROD LIDDLE Public is tiring of Meghan, Harry, Andrew and Williams whining and hypocrisy \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Be the Duchess of Woke or jet-setter, Meghan, but you cant be both \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-Brendan-ONeill.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentBRENDAN ONEILL Why so glum for those on Planet Remain  Were loving it on Planet Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   DD-COMP-IRA.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentLEO MCKINSTRY The Troubles could come back with a vengeance as New IRA rears its ugly head THAT as many as  kids could be involved in drug-dealing at a school is mind-boggling.What on earth is going on  How did teachers not notice  Was anybody in social services even awake It’s a complete failure at every level.

A disaster. A “catastrophic ­national danger”, according to the feverish .They say Britain is on a “clf edge”. If we leave without a deal it will be a “car crash”.It will bring the “hardship of war” raining down upon us, says one Brexitphobic columnist. These people seem to live in a permanent state of dread.They’re forever fantasising about a desolate post-Brexit world in which there will be “riots, looting and disorder”as zombied Brits fight each other for scraps of food and bottles of medicine.The rest of us, however, have a rather dferent take on No Deal. Across the country, far from the political bubbles and ivory towers inhabited by these anti-Brexit hysterics, people are far more chilled out about the prospect of No Deal.You hear it in everyday ­conversations: “If the EU won’t give us a good deal, let’s leave without one.”You see it on Question Time when the audience applauds a list who says we should walk away from the EUit keeps messing us about. And you see it in opinion polls, too.Much to the horror of the Brexit-bashing elites, polls show that ordinary people do not think No Deal will be the end of the world as we know it.A recent Opinium poll asked people what we should doBoris Johnson fails to wring concessions from the EU and to change the Withdrawal Agreement to make it more palatable to MPs.A whopping  per cent said we should go ahead with Brexit on October  — Boris’s ­promised exit day — evenwe don’t have a deal.Just  per cent said we should cancel Brexit altogether and  per cent said we should continue with negotiations.This echoes a YouGov poll from a few months ago. It asked what we should dothe EU refused to grant an extension to talks on the exit deal.Forty-four per cent said we should say adios without a deal. Forty-two per cent said we should revoke Brexit and stay bound to Brussels.This is all incredibly revealing. No, it does not suggest millions of us are reckless and crazy and hell-bent on jumping off the “clf edge”.Most Brits, including Boris himself, would prefer to leave with a deal,a good one can be struck.No, what the polls show is that there is only so much baloney from the EU that we are willing to take.If Eurocrats carry on behaving stubbornly and arrogantly by refusing to reopen talks about the Withdrawal Agreement, then we should show some self-respect and walk away — that is what people are saying.This captures one of the key ides between the elites and ordinary people today. The political and media classes dread No Deal because they have lost faith in Britain.They view the UK as a tiny, pathetic island that could never possibly cope outside of the EU.They think we need to be looked after by the apparently caring, maternal figure of the Brussels bureaucracy. Andwe do the political equivalent of cutting the apron strings, we will be doomed, apparently.In the rest of the country, meanwhile, people have far more faith in the nation.They believe we are more than capable of being a sovereign, independent country that strikes its own trade deals and writes its own laws.They see the country not as a useless little island, but as a plucky, resourceful nation that should reach out to the world without being beholden to any of it.The ide over No Deal reveals how much disagreement there is between the political elites and the people today.It is hard to remember a time when the chasm between Us and Them was as wide as it is right now.The th Century Prime ­Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said the UK feels like “two nations”. In one nation there are the posh and well-educated, and in the other there are ­ordinary working people.These “two nations” have entirely dferent “habits, thoughts, and feelings”, he wrote. It is asthey are “inhabitants of dferent planets”.It feels like that again today. On the planet of the Remainer elites, No Deal will be terrible, Boris is the worst PM ever, and anyone who ­disagrees is probably a racist.But on the planet inhabited by the rest of us, No Deal will be fine. And support for the Boris-led Conservative Party is rising. Surging, in fact.The latest Britain Elects ­opinion poll shows that  per cent of us would vote for the Tories, compared with just  per cent for Labour.But their shrill cries make no impact on our planet. In our more sane world, we still want Brexit to happen and we think Britain is a good, decent, capable country.The elites should come over to our planet.

Ive never seen nothing like this.He was left stunned at the mass infestation, as an alarming number eggs were seen sprawled across the discoloured mattress while the bugs kept crawling.Hundreds more made their home across the wooden bed frame and the carpet underneath, falling off the mattress, reported Story Trender.While they arent dangerous and dont spread disease, their bites can cause a rash on the skin or an allergic reaction.They y in colour from yellow, to red, to brown and they live in cracks and crevasses in and around beds.They tend to crawl out at night and feed on blood by biting exposed skin.He told the news outlet: “Bed bugs can be one of the most dficult and expensive bugs out there to get rid of.Ive been doing this for  years and it still amazes me seeing bad infestations, but I still get very excited like its the first time seeing them because were really good at what we do.The bed bugs even spread up to the houses curtains, cushions and chairs.Social media users were left horried after seeing Rorys video which shows the infestation.Many were shocked to see that the owner slept on the mattress with the bugs sprawling underneath.One person said: Man I hope you have a decontamination center.... I think Id burn my clothes and shoes and I would shower for and hour before getting anywhere near my house!Unfortunately, bed bug infestations are not uncommon.Ryan Osborne visited the house in Vancouver, Canada, and said it was the worst infestation hed ever seen in his career.Ryan said: I work in pest control and this was a house we were treating for bed bugs.

It then took an hour to get on the car park and another hour to get in the attraction.By the time it got to pm we had only been on one ride.We queued for the log flume for an hour and three quarters but then they announced that they needed to call maintenance and shut the ride.They gave us priority passes so we queued up for The Dragon rollercoaster which took another  minutes.But just as we got to the top, the ride stopped leaving all of us stuck. It wasnt just us, there were lots of other small children.They had to escort us all down in twos or threes which was really scary. All the staff had safety harnesses but we had nothing.I kept asking what would happenone of us slipped but they just said well catch you. My partners six foot and  stone, theres no way they could catch him. The health and safety was shocking.All in all we were up there for  minutes in C heat. My sons partner suffers from vertigo so she was terried and was escorted off first. The two youngest children were really upset.When we finally got off they offered us priority passes but its not good enough. Wed only been on one ride properly.At the very least I think we deserve a refund for the four of us who paid £ each. The other five have yearly passes.My partner complained to customer services and they kept blaming the hot weather. It was forecast so they could have been more prepared.Due to the issues, Legoland announced that it would be staying open an hour later until pm.A Legoland spokesman said: We want everyone to always have the best possible experience with us and are sorry to hear some people experienced discomfort caused by the stoppage on the Dragon roller coaster yesterday.Unfortunately, over the course of any day at the Park, rides may stop due to technical issues or guest actions, and on the few occasions like this, where an evacuation is required, our only priority is to assist guests from our rides safely – and to do this as quickly possible.Our staff are highly trained on these procedures and at no point were any guests at risk.Once off the ride guests were taken care of by our team until they were happy to get back to enjoying their day, and were provided with two fast track access passes for rides of their choice. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People held their noses after he was convicted but they were not going to turn down the chance to mingle with royalty.”There is no evidence the Prince attended the parties, just claims his name was used to entice others.The news comes after we told how it was claimed the Duke of York , then , was reportedly the star guest at a lavish party thrown in his honour in .Flight logs revealed in court documents also place Andrew on the private jet, which had a bed which Epstein allegedly used for group sex.In a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Saturday, Andrew, , admitted it was a “mistake” to continue to meet pervert Epstein after his release from prison in .He also suggested the financier duped him during their -year friendship by hiding his real persona from him.But a woman who claims she was in Epstein’s mansion when Andrew was there told the Mirror: “There were girls coming and going the entire timewas inside the house. It was flagrant.”The Prince is now reportedly willing to co-operate with the FBI over the shocking Epstein casehe is asked.Buckingham Palace said the Duke of York would help authorities on both sides of the Atlantic in any investigations into the disgraced millionaire.It has not yet commented on todays party claims.The palaces aides told The Daily Mail: Members of the Royal Family would always co-operate with the police in an appropriate way.It comes after Prince Andrew released a statement on the mega-rich paedo, after his private le has been under intense scrutiny following Epstein’s suicide while awaiting trial for allegedly running a child sex ring.He broke his silence to express tremendous sympathy for Epsteins victims in the y statement issued by the Palace.Angela Levin, a royal author, blasted the statement as staggeringly arrogant, disingenuous and dishonest.She wrote in the Mail On Sunday: Besides expecting our Royals not to hang around with paedophiles, we also expect them to be honest. This whole statement reeks.Does Andrew really expect us to believe that someone he did not know well and only saw infrequently was invited into the Royals inner sanctum Andrew simply cannot escape the fact that he stayed with Epstein once he was already on the sex offender register after serving time inside for sexual abuse.If he really had such tremendous sympathy he would speak to US authorities about what he knows of his former friend. Actions speak far louder than words.In the statement Andrew said: It is apparent to me since the suicide of Mr Epstein that there has been an immense amount of media speculation about so much in his le.This is particularly the case in relation to my former association or friendship with Mr Epstein.Therefore I am eager to clary the facts to avoid further speculation.I met Mr Epstein in . During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year. I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.Disgraced financier Epstein, , hanged himself in his New York jail cell on August  amid a string of multi-million dollar lawsuits brought by some of his alleged victims.Andrew was notoriously photographed with his arm around Epstein’s alleged “sex slave” Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, when she was .But he has denied sleeping with her and declared himself “appalled” by reports of his former friend’s “alleged crimes”.Ms Giuffres claims against Andrew were struck from a court case in .The judge ruled they were “immaterial and impertinent”.Andrew has  reiterated it was a mistake seeing Epstein after his release from an -month prison term in  for prostituting minors.He was pictured with the financier in Central Park, New York, at the time and footage has since emerged of him at Epsteins home in the city in the same year.His statement continued: I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release in  and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know.I have tremendous sympathy for all those affected by his actions and behaviour.His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.This is a dficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epsteins lestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.Epsteins inquiry is now focusing on several alleged co-conspirators, believed to include Ghislaine Maxwell, , the daughter of disgraced newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell.At least five women who say they were abused by Epstein have filed lawsuits against his £million estate after the paedo killed himself.All said Epstein used a “vast enterprise” of associates to recruit them, subject them to unwanted sex acts and keep them under his control.He was arrested on July  over claims he was involved in the sex-trafficking of dozens of girls as young as  from at least  until .Epstein had denied the charges and was being held in prison until his trial where he was facing up to  years in prisonconvicted.Andrew is on holiday in Spain with ex-we Sarah Ferguson, , as Buckingham Palace fights to clear his name amid revelations that have surfaced since Epstein’s death.A previous Buckingham Palace statement said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes. "},{"url":null,"title":"mum wins 10k a month 30 years set for life lottery","story":"Vicky Mitchell, from Halax, used the last £. left in her online account from a previous win to buy a line for the August  draw.The -year-old said: In a million years you never think youll win big but this is le changing.Vickys Lucky Dip winning numbers were , , , ,  and the Le Ball .The administrative assistant at an accountancy firm said: I pick up lucky dips every now and then for whichever game I fancy.I was heading off to Skegness and so quickly thought to play online.I won £ on Thunderball which was great and I used that win to buy a ticket for dferent draws across the next few days.I won again, this time £ on Set For Le, so I put that back on ious draws.MOST READ IN NEWS\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   KH-COMPOSITE-MICHELLE.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" with her babies Mum whose  kids died in petrol bomb attack dies in hospital  months on \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   VP-COMP-JOHN-LEWIS-GUARD.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" shop shame John Lewis security guard puts dad in a choke hold as he shops for baby clothes \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HOUSE ABOUT THAT Three-bed detached house goes on sale for just £k - but theres a catch \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-comp-legoland-terror.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" DONT LEGO!

The Labour leader said he plans to step in as interim leaderMPs vote to topple the PM to delay Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario.But Ms Swinson said Mr Corbynaposs insistence on being the interim PM risked not enough MPs supporting the vote In a new letter to Mr Corbyn ahead of cross-party talks scheduled for Tuesday, Ms Swinson said: Insisting you lead that emergency government will therefore jeopardise the chances of a no confidence vote gaining enough support to pass in the first place. Labour did not respond to the letter. Instead, the party referred to comments made by its shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, who on Sunday described Ms Swinson as extremely petulant for dismissing Mr Corbynaposs initial proposal to lead a temporary government. Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave the EU on  October, with or without a deal. But on Sunday the PM sounded less confident when he told the BBC that securing a deal was touch and go having previously said the odds of no deal were a million to one.    Over the weekend former Labour PM Gordon Brown described Mr Corbynaposs plan as self-indulgent aposmadnessapos.The former prime minister criticised the Labour leader, as well as Jo Swinson and SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Mr Brown said Mr Corbyn and others should be holding talks with EU leaders rather than aposnominating each other to a so-called national unity governmentapos. Writing in the Sunday Mail, Mr Brown said: Even the Europeans we are bargaining with can see that putting a gun to your own head and saying youaposll shoot yourselfyou donapost get your own way is a self-defeating tactic. Instead of the silly-season madness, opposition parties should this week be talking to European leaders, and calling on them to drop the October  deadline. In her letter Ms Swinson said Tory MP Ken Clarke and former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman could possible caretaker leaders, and said both have expressed willingness to take on the role. Ms Swinson also called on Mr Corbyn to clary his position on whether he was opposed to Brexit altogether. Jo Swinsonaposs letter to Jeremy Corbyn in full:Letter from Leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson to the Leader of the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn:Dear Jeremy, Thank you for your letter on st August  regarding a meeting to discuss how we can prevent a No Deal Brexit .As I have always said, my door is open to any Parliamentarians who wish to work together to prevent a disastrous No Deal.The same applies to all Parliamentarians who, like the Liberal Democrats , want to Stop Brexit altogether.Brexit will be disastrous for our country and those who wish to stop it must work together in the national interest. Ahead of the meeting, and for the benefit of all those right across the country who are worried about the threat of a No Deal, it would be useful to set out an agenda. This is so that the British public can be reassured that politicians are leaving no option off the table when faced with crashing out on October st. I propose the following topics of discussion..    Strategy for a legislative approach to successfully take over the order paper to prevent No DealThis would need to follow the example of previous successful initiatives by the Commons in order to pass, and so be led from the backbenches with the cooperation of prominent senior Conservative and Labour MPs. Motions tabled by the Labour frontbench have not worked previously and therefore I hope you will accept that we need to allow backbench MPs to take the lead. For this to work, we must also work together to ensure that non-Government MPs, including Labour MPs, who have not supported such measures in the past come behind plans in the face of this national crisis..    Plan for an alternative strategy built around a vote of No Confidence in the GovernmentWe should discuss how to maximise the chance of a successful No Confidence vote. As I have set out before, the Liberal Democrats would vote No Confidence in the government were you to table one, and we called for such a motion to be tabled before the Summer recess to be certain we would have had time to hold a General Election before October st..    Discuss the steps that would need to be taken in forming an emergency government This emergency government must have the majority support required to request and secure an Article  extension should the vote of No Confidence in the government be successful.

The national humiliation of Boris Johnson grinning ­gormlessly at Donald Trump, awaiting the order to jump just so he could beg “how high ”, was ly spun by Downing Street as a special ­relationship. But a desperate Tory Prime Minister who would be out of his depth in a shower tray would be taken to the cleaners in any trade deal with “America First” Trump. The US reinforced to me the ­foolishness, unpredictability and toxicity of a President who mistakenly thinks he is the Chosen One – despite his popularity ratings being lower than Barack Obama’s. Trump is for the broth pot next year unless the Democrats, Labour’s sister party, beats itself.  Johnson is equally isive, and this pair of malevolent clowns are malicious egomaniacs twisting to fool some of the people all of the time to cling to high office. The Selfservative PM employs Trumpian demagoguery to lead incited masses. Exploiting the justied furies of working people trampled down by Tory austerity and the casino capitalism he champions, the liar in Downing Street blames migrants and Europe for economic and social crimes committed by his own party and ideology.

Scot James Cooper was left fighting for le after ing from the Kalofer Hotel, in Bulgaria, last year. At one stage, medics gave relatives of the -year-old stonemason the stark prognosis before he eventually recovered, the Daily Record reports. James’s we Janet, from Dunfermline, says she alerted the hotel’s bosses about his condition and demanded they take action.    The couple were shocked when they read last week that two holidaymakers had died from Legionnaires’ shortly after staying at the Kalofer this summer. John Cowan , from Hamilton, and Brian Taylor, , from Huddersfield, passed away within days of each other. They stayed at the -star Sunny Beach resort in June. Janet said: “As James started to recover, I thought I would contact the hotel manager to let her know about his illness. “I advised her to check the air conditioning and shower systems to hopefully avoid this happening to anyone . “She responded promptly via Facebook Messenger, shocked at my news, but also listing their alleged water cleansing routine and timetable.    She contacted me a couple of times after that, asking how James was. I was so shocked that these deaths have happened this year.” James, who spent nearly three weeks in hospital, said: “It was terrying. One minute you’re on holiday having a great time. The next, you’re fighting for your le in hospital.” Janet, James and their teenage daughter Chloe stayed at the Kalofer in July last year. They booked the break directly with the hotel. On the second-last night, James slept for a couple of hours with the air conditioning on while Chloe was in another room and Janet was on the balcony. The family believe it was during this period – the only time the aircon was used – that James picked up the bug.  Janet said the day after they ed home, James had a dry cough. Later, his breathing became laboured. He was diagnosed with a chest infection and given antibiotics. But his condition worsened and he was rushed to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where he spent four days in a coma. He was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia Legionella. In messages to Janet, the Kalofer said they’d spent £, on a system to prevent Legionnaires’ and assured her all tests had come back negative. Last night, hotel spokeswoman Stanislava Petrova said they had “not been informed by the local health authorities about any case from last year”. She said: “From the beginning of the summer season, more than  samples from the guest rooms, the kitchen, the pools, the water heaters and the other parts and systems in the hotel have been tested and in all, no Legionella is found.” "},{"url":null,"title":"john lewis security guard loses","story":"NewsJohn Lewis security guard suspended after putting new dad, , in headlockKyle Spencer, , was grabbed by the neck and violently dragged out of the John Lewis in Westgate, OxfordShareCommentsByBrendan McFadden:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video john-lewis-security-guard-loses-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Shocking footage shows Kyle Spencer, , being grabbed by the neck and violently dragged out of the John Lewis in Westgate, Oxford on August . New dad Kyle, was out shopping for baby clothes for the arrival of his firstborn child, Emilia, when he said he was “assaulted” by the security guard. The family claim the scuffle started when the security guard asked the family to leave after Kyle’s -year-old sister accidentally pressed a button on a speaker, causing loud music to play. John Lewis have announced that the security guard no longer works at the store and have apologised for his actions.    Kyle said I physically couldn’t breathe. It was absolutely terrying. He had my neck so tight that I thought I was going to die. “For a good week or so after it happened I was scared to go into town again. “My sisters were in absolute distress. No child should have to see their big brother get attacked like that. “He was full of anger. I thought he would never let go.” Kyle was visiting the store at around pm with his two sisters, one who filmed the incident on her phone. The clip shows the guard grab Kyle, from Oxford, by the neck and wrestle him out of the store. The family claim the scuffle started after Kyle’s -year-old sister pressed a button on a speaker causing loud music to play. Security guards were then called by store workers to investigate reports of disruptive behaviour, and Kyle was hauled out of the shop.    Kyle says his sister turned the music on by accident and panicked having caused a disruption. The group were approached by the security guard, who asked the three of them to leave the store, Kyle said. But Kyle claims the guard became aggressive when he asked to see his ID badge. He asked to see some form of identication because the guard, dressed in shorts and a polo shirt, “didn’t look like” someone who worked for John Lewis. Kyle said: “To me he just looked like a normal person in normal clothes. “He refused to show me his badge and started to get angry about it. I didn’t try to cause an argument or try to be awkward. “He asked us to leave but when we were talking he pushed me twice.” Video footage then shows the guard spin Kyle around and grab him by the neck. Kyle said he tried to defend himself by resisting the “heavy-handed” guards attempt to grapple with him.    After dragging Kyle out of the store the guard continues to hold Kyle by the neck. His sisters can be heard screaming in distress as their brother is taken to the ground. Kyle reported the incident to Thames Valley Police. An investigation was launched but no action was taken against the guard. Kyle said he went to AE later that night with neck pain and bruised ribs. He claims doctors diagnosed him with a sprain and whiplash. Following the closure of the police investigation Kyle reported the incident to John Lewis directly, on August . He received a letter of apology from the guard the next day, in which it is claimed Kyle used abusive and threatening language, which he denies.

Mr Aitchison said: “My sister and her husband had booked the hotel and we had no idea it was at the top of a hill before we went. “I was horried when I saw it because there was no way I could easily walk up, especially in the Spanish heat. “ I could have possibly forced myself to the top but I’ve no idea what state I’d be in by the time I’d got there. “Just attempting it left me sweating and breathless – so, in the end, we left my sister and her husband to climb the hill – and Pam and I gave up and got in a taxi.  “I was so big then, I couldn’t even bend down to tie my shoelaces and so that, and the hotel hill, made me realise I had to do something about it.” When Mr Aitchison joined Slimming World two years ago he had already lost one stone, but he wasnapost sure he would be able to lose more weight. He said: “I joked at first that I was just keeping Pam company, but in truth, I was too embarrassed to admit that I was doing it for me and I needed to do it. “And,I’m honest, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do it. I had been big for so long I wasn’t sure I could lose weight.” He has now dropped down to st ½lbs after dramatically changing his diet and taking up exercise.

But, in February this year, she and Paul were told by bemused doctors they would be having triplets.Speaking to the Manchester Evening News , Paul said: It was a really lovely surprise. We have only been together a year and Elise told me she couldnapost have any more children and we had children of our own so it was okay.

After going for another check-up, the couple were then told they would be having triplets.

Lily was born weighing lb  ounces, Lucy was lb  ounces and Arthur was lb  ounces. Elise added: Iaposm doing good, the babies are doing really good. Iaposm back home now and we are visiting them every day. Itaposs really overwhelming, but itaposs lovely. They are gorgeous. Hopefully they wonapost be in there for long, but the staff at the hospital have been amazing. As to how the couple will cope with demands of caring for three babies at the same time, Elise added: Itaposs not as hard as you think, weaposre just getting it done. Weaposve both got really good and really big families who are also helping.

Vicky Mitchell, from Halax, matched all five numbers and the Le Ball in the Set For Le draw - making her one of the five top prize winners so far. The -year-old, who has two children, initially thought sheaposd won £ before the scale of her prize sunk in. She will have the huge sum paid into her account each month for the next  years. Vicky said: “In a million years you never think you’ll win big but this is le changing.”    She used the last £. from a previous win in her online account to buy the line for the draw on Monday August . Vicky plans to go on holiday to Spain - which had been booked before her win - before moving house. She said: “Getting my own car so I don’t have to share one or get the bus, and moving to a bigger house with a nice garden are on the cards. I want to stay grounded but I know le is going to change.” Vicky, an admin assistant at an accountancy firm, doesn’t play The National Lottery regularly, occasionally picking up a ticket for one of the games.    It was only because she went away for a weekend that her run of luck, which ended with her being Set For Le, began. “I pick up Lucky Dips every now and then for whichever game I fancy, she said. I was heading off to Skegness and so quickly thought to play online. I won £ on Thunderball which was great and I used that win to buy a ticket for dferent draws across the next few days. I won again, this time £ on Set For Le, so I put that back on ious draws. It was the last ticket I bought with this win, a £. Set For Le Lucky Dip for the Monday, that I won on and which has changed my le.” She discovered sheaposd won when she got an email, which she read after getting up early to ensure her son was up on time for work.  She said: “I was half asleep when I saw the email and thought ‘great it’s another fiver’. I couldn’t work it out and see what I had actually won, it said I had to log on.” Vicky continued: “I woke up my partner, Adam, and shoved my phone in his face saying that I’d won the lottery. He said, ‘what a pound ’ and I just shouted ‘no, look, look, look’. It was still early so we then had an agonising wait to call The National Lottery line to get it all confirmed.” She said it now means she can now make purchases she would have had to avoid before. Vicky stated: “It’s still sinking in but whereas before I would see a jumper for one of my sons and think that I couldn’t afford it I can now just buy it.” She also wants to live somewhere more spacious.

But later in the shower, you notice the ingredients’ list. A quick Google search reveals they aren’t that eco-friendly after all. You’ve sadly fallen for “greenwashing”. The term applies to instances where unsubstantiated or misleading claims are made about the environmental benefits of a product, service, technology or company. The same can be said for well-meaning public figures seeking to promote their green credentials while hopping on gas-guzzling private jets, inevitably opening themselves up to criticism. Prince Harry faced this situation last week after Elton John sought to defend his recent private jet journey to the south of France, saying the flight was “carbon-neutral” as he’d made an appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint. The firm is a leading player in a rapidly growing industry which seeks to provide a quick option to repair some of the damage caused by modern lestyles by payinga small fee. In turn, this finances a iety of projects to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by plantingtrees, or to prevent it frombeing emitted.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly unethical form of greenwashing. Sceptics also point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a signicant effect.

Cambridge-educated Mrs Collett and her husband Mike ran Ultimate Aerobatics from the airfield - the base of the West London Aero Club - and competed with the British Advanced Aerobatics team. They both learnt aerobatics - involving spins, rolls and loops - in the Pitts S-A, which has a top speed of just over mph, according to their companyaposs website.    Mrs Collett, who was inspired to become a pilot after seeing a fighter jet aged nine and had her first flying lesson when she was , won the UK standard class nationals in G-ODDS using the plane.

A caring and considerate nature, Emily’s generosity in sharing her knowledge and time to help others was well known in the aerobatic community and beyond, helping many pilots achieve their goals.

The man - who only wants to be referred to as Tom - met Julie, which is not her real name, on an online dating website in early . Tom, who lives in Cornwall and is in his late s, fell in love with Julie almost immediately. He was so hooked on her that just three months later, the pair bought a house together.However, Tom now has reason to believe that Julie was working as an outcall escort while they were together.He also feels like he was the victim of narcissistic abuse, reports Cornwall Live. “I believe she suffers with narcissistic personality disorder,” he said.“I really educated myself on what that is, how sociopaths manage people, how they are manipulative, how they prey on orced people. “Idealise, devalue and then discard, that’s the phase of their relationships.” Tom’s story began in , when he joined an online dating service called Match.  “I got orced and I was in a vulnerable position,” Tom said. “But I was keen to get on with my le so I jumped on there. “A woman winked at me and we got chatting and went on a date. The moment I met her it was so intense. She was all over me, and I fell in love almost immediately.” Over the course of the next three months the pair met each other’s friends and family, while travelling back and forth between their houses in Cornwall and Devon.   “When I went up to Devon to visit her she would be in lingerie, there were rose petals everywhere, and candles lit. “She was in her early thirties, very attractive, on paper it was great. It was brilliant. It was very sexual, she had a bag of toys and she wanted to make me happy. “Everything was about the future, she was saying we are going to be Mr and Mrs [surname], I can’t wait to use your surname. It was a fairy tale almost. “In the back of my mind it was too good to be true, but I never suspected anything. Possibly because of that distance, she was doing what I am now led to believe she was doing at the time.” They chose a location about halfway between their homes in Cornwall and Devon, and put down £, each on a deposit for a four-bedroom cottage.   “She had money in the bank, she would always say she’s skint but she had enough for the deposit,” Tom said. Seven months later, the couple moved into their new home. The first time Tom walked through the front door, everything was already in place.  “I thought she had done an amazing job, but I think it was her going in and saying, ‘I own this’. What was odd was her finding my degree certicates from somewhere and having them framed.I wasn’t comfortable with that. But she would always talk highly of me and make me feel good about myself during that phase.” Around two months after they moved in, Tom had his son over to stay for the weekend. Julie was talking about improvements they could make to the house when she suddenly “lost it”. Tom explained: “She made it about money, that I earned twice as much as her, and wanted me to pay more towards the mortgage. I said ‘what do you want to be, a kept woman’, and I’ve never seen a switch change so much in a person.” Julie stormed up the stairs and turned on Tom’s son. “She jumped up, there was no warning of it happening. She went up the stairs shouting, ‘get your f***ing son out of my house, I don’t want him here’. “She went to the door and my son was physically shaking. She went for him. In a fit of rage, Tom went to push Julie away and caught her on the throat. Julie called the police but didn’t press any charges, and the two made up and carried on. Tom said: “She didnapost like kids, she didnapost like my son being around her and made that clear many times. She made me feel bad just for having him around. It was all about the assault on her, rather than the abuse that triggered that. This woman was everything to me, to a point. And we got past it and back to the idealisation phase. The next week we did a tour of London, just me and her.”    In  Julie began mentioning a man at work, although Tom didn’t suspect anything as he believed they were just friends. Six months later Tom received a bombshell message from the man’s we, who told him their partners were having an affair. “When I opened the message Julie was stood just in front of me. I grabbed hold of her hand and put it on my heart, and I showed her the message. She point blank denied it. “Much later, after we separated, I asked the neighbourhe had seen any comings and goings, and he said this guy had been in the house on several occasions when I was at work. “Anyway, at the time I just put it to bed, even though it was niggling away every time she picked up her phone. I noticed she was on her phone a lot.” A week later, Tom again challenged Julie over the affair claim. “I picked up her phone and said, ‘If I had all the secrets that are in here I’d know the truth, wouldn’t I’. And she jumped up and punched me, pushed me down the stairs, kicked me, grabbed my phone and threw it at the wall.” Moments later, Julie broke down and confided in Tom that she was sexually assaulted as a child. “I was like, ‘oh my God’, and gave her a cuddle and was telling her we can get through this, Tom said.So the onus and the blame was back on me. We booked a holiday so we had something to look forward to, I thought she’s told the truth about what happened to her, and we were back on track.”    Days later, Julie exploded again and stormed off to a friend’s house down the road. She accused Tom of beating her, and called the police. Tom was arrested on suspicion of assault and spent  hours in a cell, but no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence. The relationship was coming to an end, and Julie put their house up for sale. “It became blackmail, Tom said. She was demanding £, from me to buy her out, although she only put half of that into the deposit. I left the house, and moved back in with my folks. “In emails she downplayed the whole relationship, while I was led to believe it was the best thing since sliced bread. I was still questioning why we couldn’t get back together.” Julie then reported Tom to the police for harassment and the pair stopped all communications at the end of February this year, while Tom bought Julie’s share in the house. “I didn’t know what it was all about, this abrupt ending, and the whole thing left me emotionally in tatters. I still thought it was because of this affair. It later became clear they were having some sort of relationship.” Tom claims he later found out from a family member that Julie had worked as a prostitute several years earlier, and the truth began to unravel."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast bank holiday","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Bank holiday Monday set to smash record for hottest everThe previous record for the August bank holiday Monday is just .C - but today is expected to reach CShareCommentsBySam Rkaina:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video look-weather-bank-holiday-next-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Just after announcing their engagement, her sister-in-law revealed that she was pregnant.The American bride says she was really excited about the baby and was pleased for the other couple. But when her bridal shower rolled around in May things started to take a sour turn.    She said: My mom wanted me to have a wedding shower so I picked late May. I sent out invites for May . About two weeks before my shower my sister-in-law sent out invites for her baby shower - for May . My husbandaposs relatives who I had invited and who had RSVPed my shower skipped for hers. Sister-in-law showed up at my shower in the last hour wearing a white dress, a tiara and a pink satin sash over her chest. But things only got worse from here and there was a big clash over the wedding itself.    She continues: Husband and I picked June  for the wedding. We had everything set up, everything paid for, a church and a minister, reception hall.It was all set and ready to go. About a week before sister-in-law announces that she scheduled her c-section for June .Sheaposs not ill nor is the baby at risk, but she has a placenta condition that makes vaginal birth dangerous. Mother and father-in-law told us thatthey had to choose between the first grandchild and our wedding theyaposd choose the baby. Then a bunch of their family friends got wind that these relatives werenapost attending and backed out as well.  She ended up having an argument with her sister-in-law the day before the wedding day, saying: Youaposve been an a**hole to me lately and I donapost know why. You stole the day of my wedding and now youaposre stealing my wedding day. One day, one day out of the motherf***ing year I want to be the one whoaposs in the spotlight and now I canapost.

Youaposve stolen my day and my excitement, she adds. Her sister-in-law had the baby safely but the bride is now refusing to go see the little girl. Her brother-in-law called her a d*** for not visiting, but she is still mad at the couple. People in the comments were quick to tell her she had every right to be mad. This is so bad, replied one person. Worst of all itaposs never going to end. Every year on her anniversary itaposs the babyaposs birthday. Another said: I donapost understand why people couldnapost do both the wedding and the birth. Why not go visit the baby around the wedding schedule  A third added: That really does take the cake.

Also pictured is the painted dome above the altar and murals on ceiling beams, which still look stunning despite being more than  years old. Marioaposs incredible images were painted using whatever materials and supplies he could find around the camp. Boiled fish bones were used as an adhesive to bond and preserve the paint that was pigmented with fruit, vegetables, tobacco and tea leaves to create a range of colours.    Mario left the camp at the end of the war but   years later he was astonished to be told by children the chapel was still there by schoolchildren when he visited the village in .

For me, the s squad does not bother me. There have been thousands of boys down the years that’ve got  caps in the s and never had a career in the game.“For us it’s about first-team football, getting them into our team and seeing what happens after that.”That desire to get his kids first-team football is why Robbie has loaned out the likes of Declan Glass and Matty Smith, both now at Cove Rangers.Youth players Alassan Jones and Michael McArthur have also gone out to juniors Broughty Athletic, who were instrumental in Appere’s development last season.“There is no point in having guys here that are real good prospects and not getting them a game.“They just end up fading out and their career gets ruined.“We have to make sure we give them the best opportunity to play here.“If they are not quite there yet then they go somewhere  and come back in six months# time but, when they do, we have to make sure there is an opportunity for them here.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/cammy-kerr.jpg ","title":"no derby talk at dens says cammy kerr as they focus on inverness clash","story":"There’s absolutely no derby talk at Dens Park says Cammy Kerr as first of all Dundee get ready for a tough Championship test against Inverness tomorrow.The Dark Blues welcome their Highland opponents to Dens Park for the second time this season after knocking John Robertson’s side out of the Betfred Cup last month.The attention for plenty fans, of both dark blue and tangerine persuasion, has already switched to next Friday’s derby.Kerr accepts there’s nothing that can be done about that but insists the players are doing no such thing.He told the Tele: “Everyone  must be thinking of that and it can be hard sometimes to ignore the distractions with everything that goes on seeing online that people have got their tickets and stuff like that.“But as players we know we have a really tough game against Inverness first tomorrow.“That’s our focus and once that’s done we move on to the next one.“That’s why we are supposed to be professional football players because you have to stay professional.“You have to stay focused, know what the aims are and that is only looking at tomorrow.“It’s all about getting a result tomorrow.“We are under no illusions how good Inverness are.“We had a really tough game against them in the Betfred Cup, though I thought we were the better team.“They are a really good side and John Robertson always has them set up well, so we need to make sure our tactics and performance are spot on.”The warning for the Dark Blues is that, by Inverness’ recent history in this ision as one of the strongest teams, they’ll be better than they were during that - loss at Dens.Cammy added: “I think they will have improved since going out to us in the cup.“That would have been deflating and then they got turned over by United the following week and that will have been a wake-up call.“They are not used to getting turned over like that in this league because they are always a good, competitive side.“We need to make sure we are at it come tomorrow.”He added: “I think we have improved since then as well.“We have a couple more signings in the door, the squad is starting to come together and there will be excitement after the performance last week.“Even after the Ayr game, there was a real buzz about the place in the stands.“People have been telling me they feel the buzz in the stands before games and that’s great to hear.“If we can get that again this weekend it really helps.“Looking at the fixtures, tomorrow will be three home games in a row and then United, so that’s still in the city and then another home game after that.“That’s a time to, hopefully, build a foundation to kick on for the rest of the season.”Dundee got a lot of plaudits for the way they went about the Aberdeen match last weekend.Kerr says, though that is nice to hear, the result still stung.“We took a lot from the game last week. We’re still hurting, though, because it was a scalp we could have taken and we were a couple of minutes from taking it.“To do that would have been great and the sucker punch at the end killed that but the boys are happy with the performance.

And his Tarbert roots run deeper, he was the head chef in Stonefield Castle in  where he met his we Irene, whose family still live in the village.Together with his son Ryan and Ross Payne from the Anchor Hotel the chefs settled in for an afternoon of cooking the finest seafood for the  seafood lovers who had booked their tables though the festival’s Facebook page.No one was left hungry as food started to arrive on tables and by the end of the afternoon there nothing left to cook and the chefs could have a welcome break.While the sunshine certainly added to the enjoyment of this new seafood experience Mike was delighted with the lunch service, saying: ‘It’s been a fantastic day, everyone enjoyed themselves and most of all we’ve raised over £ for the festival. We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular. Next year we’ll do it again, I’ve got a couple of things up my sleeve so look out for something even more special.’"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"trailer load of cash raised for marie curie","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOne lucky winner can look forward to a cosy winter after winning a trailer load of logs at Mid Argyll Show.The sticks were donated, as in previous years, by Ardrishaig#s Alan Ryan to the Mid Argyll Marie Curie Fundraising Group for their stand at the show.

will take place on Thursday.A spokesman for Unite told us: \"Between  and  strikers and supporters are expected to assemble.\"The workers in the roads department have been treated with contempt and the latest efforts by the council to draft in contracted workers to cover workers taking action is disgraceful.ldquoInstead of positively engaging with the workers and Unite, the council seem intent on escalating the dispute.\"Unite will explore every legal avenue to challenge this aggressive action.ldquoUnite also believes that there is a strong legal case that workers are being offered unlawful financial inducements to break the existing collective bargaining agreements.The reasoning behind the dispute has been refuted by the local authority chief executive Tracey Logan.She told us: \"Some of the allegations made by Unite about the planned strike by a small number of roads department staff on August  are absolutely unfounded and cannot be left unchallenged.ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.\"The strike is set to coincide with a meeting of

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really important to put your bucket down every now and then, and that can make it easier to empty as well."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-railway-isn-39-t-perfect-39-s-better-driving","story":"Sure, things

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-greggs-vegan-roll","story":"So the vegan sausage roll was a hit It proved so popular, Greggs had to increase production to meet demand.And in March - two months after the firm released the product to much fanfare - it announced annual sales of pound billion for the first time, saying the snack helped sales surge by .%.Whatrsquos it made of Designed to mirror some of the sausage rollrsquos classic features, it features Greggsrsquo own bespoke Quorn filling, encased in ldquo layers of light and crisp puff pastry.Signicantly, it launched during ldquoVeganuary, when many people go vegan for the month of January.It sparked a bit of a fuss It met with a mixed response initially.

With their viciously sharp, curved horns, rather angry scowl and considerable girth, itrsquos probably best to give them a wide berth.Yet despite what he describes as having been ldquoduffed up by his stampeding herd, his water buffalo appear to hold the key to what must be Scotlandrsquos most inventive case of farm ersication yet.Andhis plan to create the first Scottish-made buffalo mozzarella reach fruition, herds of the beasts ndash which he insists are far more gentle than they may look ndash could eventually replace fields of more familiar grazing Friesians, supplying the creamy milk for his cheese and low fat, low cholesterol meat.Mr Mitchell, who runs Scotlandrsquos first buffalo farm, recently spent the day before the birth of his first child launching a major crowdfunding effort aimed at inspiring an ambitious pound, of investment to produce Scotlandrsquos first home-produced buffalo mozzarella.The funding would go towards building a manufacturing facility, milking parlour and slurry store to complement the Fe farmrsquos existing buffalo beef production, farm shops, event catering and cafeacute.It could see a Fe version of traditional southern Italian buffalo mozzarella ndash which must be made using milk from buffalos - land on supermarket shelves Aldi has already expressed interest in adding it to its stores.The mozzarella dream is now taking shape. However, dramatic events of one day in , when Mr Mitchell became the first Scottish farmer to be trampled by a herd of water buffalo, could have put it on ice before it even started.ldquoI was five weeks in hospital, he recalls. ldquoIt was a case of lsquosilly mersquo. I got in between a cow and a protective mum.ldquoI realised it wasnrsquot good when the mum let out a war cry. That meant the herd got jumpy and I got duffed up.With a herd of  startled buffalo to contend with, is it possible hersquos underplaying it slightly  ldquoWell, it was more like being gored a little bit. Well, actually a big bit, he concedes.The frightened herd dragged him  metres across a field and through a pond before a witness drove a pick-up truck across the field, desperately blaring the horn to scatter the beasts. It saved his le in the process.Mr Mitchell was left bleeding, bruised, with puncture wounds on his lower body and several weeks in hospital.He was, however, undaunted. Indeed, one of the farmrsquos larger specimens - a one-ton angry-looking infertile bull with vicious arm- curved horns and dubbed  despite, as Mr Mitchell points out, ldquofiring blanks - has become its mascot and is known for rolling on its side and having its belly tickled.It transpires that not only is he Scotlandrsquos first water buffalo farmer, and the first to survive a buffalo stampede, he is also the first to have a buffalo bull as a pet.He may be breaking new ground in farming, yet he is the sixth generation of his family to farm the land at Clemtrie near Kirkcaldy. His father died in a farming accident when he was a toddler, and he grew up watching his uncle keep the business going by rearing large white Duroc pigs and creating an award-winning pork and bacon business.Inspired, Mr Mitchell used his inheritance in  to invest in the countryrsquos first water buffalo herd, bought from a Welsh farm and imported from Romania.ldquoIt suited my skill set, he explains. ldquoMy passion is cattle, but lots of people are selling beef at farmersrsquo markets. One of the first things you learn about farming is that you must find a way to ersy, and you need a unique selling point.ldquoBuffalo provides healthy meat, has low cholesterol, low saturated fat and they produce amazing, rich, creamy milk.Paired with lush Scottish grass, and the result, he says, is an even better quality product with the potential of creating Scottish buffalo mozzarella that could even beat traditional Italian-made competitors.Indeed, an Irish farmrsquos buffalo mozzarella pearls, produced in West Cork using milk from its herd, was rated among the best in the by a  of  experts at the World Cheese Awards, beating  cheeses from  dferent countries.Itrsquos a success that Mr Mitchell believes can be replicated here. And hersquos hopeful that other dairy farmers who have faced a decade of low milk prices and falling demand, might join him on Scotlandrsquos own buffalo trail.Buffalo milk, he points out, also makes deliciously creamy ice cream and is commonly drunk around the world. It also has less cholesterol than dairy cow milk, has % more protein and has extra potassium which is said to help lower blood pressure.ldquoThey are robust, they will breed and continue to produce milk for three times as long as a normal dairy beast in conventional farming, he adds.And while the cows provide the milk, there is the potential to rear the male calves for beef ndash supplying rising demand from professional kitchens for buffalo steak, burgers, sausages and even a potential rival for Desperate Danrsquos cow pie, buffalo steak pie.As a result, the familiar sight of typical grazing dairy herds could soon be replaced by distinctive black water buffalo.ldquoA big part of my objective is to try to encourage farmers to produce buffalo milk in the future which can help us reach our goals, adds Mr Mitchell.ldquoThere is a current UK market of pound million and a  per cent year on year growth within the mozzarella market.ldquoAnd I strongly believe that Scotland needs a quality home produced alternative to imported mozzarella."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-help-children-caught-chernobyl","story":"But the programme that charted the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion in  has led to an unexpected spin-off as a Scots charity that helps children affected by the disaster saw a huge increase in volunteers looking to help.For over ten years, the tiny Friends of Chernobylrsquos Children West Lothian charity has battled to raise the money needed to bring groups of around  children each to stay in the homes of ordinary families for a month at a time, over a five year period.A group of children from Bykhov in Belarus, one of the areas most contaminated by the radioactive fall-out from the nuclear disaster, are now coming to the end of a refreshing month-long stay in family homes in West Lothian, which has seen them enjoy the kind of summer many Scots children taken for granted.There have been trips to outdoor centres and a castle, theyrsquove explored heritage sites including New Lanark and ndash a first for the children whose Belarus home is mostly pancake flat ndash climbed a hill.For four busy weeks which have included trips to the doctor and dentist for a health check-up, they have been able to live without being haunted by Chernobylrsquos deadly legacy.But while itrsquos a bitter-sweet moment for the small charity, support has come from the five-part HBO dramatisation of the disaster.ldquoWe were looking for new families to step in for next year, so I placed a social media advert on the last day of Chernobyl being screened, says group organiser Kenny Turnbull.ldquoWe would normally struggle to find families who can commit to five years. We were looking for , but because of the programme, we got  replies.ldquoWe tell families all they need is a big heart and a spare bed, inthey have a fantastic experience seeing these children so happy.The series traces the story of the  explosion which saw reactor four in the V.I Lenin Nuclear Power Plant in Pripyat, Ukraine, erupt when unsanctioned experiments went horribly wrong.The incident led to radioactive material escaping from the plant, sending a contaminated cloud of dust over Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and most of Europe.However, it took several days before the incident was confirmed, after the alarm was raised when Swedish power plant workers were with suspiciously high radioactive particles on their clothing.Belarus received an estimated % of the contamination, affecting at least seven million people. In some areas, contamination was at the same level as that of the official Chernobyl contamination zone.Studies have claimed the children whose parents were exposed to radioactive fallout in Belarus have twice as many mutations in their DNA as British children, raising their risk of genetic diseases, spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations.There have also been increased incidence of thyroid cancer, while Chernobylrsquos legacy is said to have sparked high levels of depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems.The positive impact of spending a little time away from their humble wooden homes and the poverty that grips many of their lives, is often plain to see.ldquoEven in one visit you see a huge improvement in their health, Mr Turnbull explains. ldquoWe take a picture of every child before they come, and towards the end of their stay you can really see the dference ndash they look much healthier and happier in space of one visit.ldquoOne little girl was so shy, frightened and introverted when she first came, but you can see over the five years how she grows to become much more sociable and healthier.ldquoOne of the things we see most is an improvement in their confidence. They are smiling.The group makes regular visits to Belarus to meet families in their own homes and to deliver packages of vitamins ndash which the children take every day ndash food and to offer help with living conditions.ldquoUsually children come from wood houses with an outside toilet and a well, he adds. ldquoEven basic things like washing their face means they have to go outside to get a bucket of water.ldquoIn winter, the weather can be - and in summer + ndash it can be a harsh le.ldquoWhen we visit, we take food and ask to put it in the fridge. Thatrsquos when we see that therersquos nearly nothing to eat, he adds. ldquoThey might grow their own food because theyrsquore too poor to buy it, but what theyrsquore growing is in contaminated soil.Research by the World Health Organisation in  showed that every month children spend away from the irradiated zone should boost the chance of prolonging their lives. Some research even claimed it could en le spans by up to two years.The break is said to give their immune system respite from battling contaminates, leaving them better placed to fight viruses and bugs.ldquoWe have a little girl whorsquos now  years old and was diagnosed with bone cancer two years ago, adds Mr Turnbull. ldquoAnother lost her little brother to cancer when he was only two years old.ldquoItrsquos harder to see the mental health impact. One little girl found her grandmother dead after she took her own le, and witnessed her mum being stabbed.Among the dficulties, however, are many signs of hope. ldquoItrsquos incredible to see children who came here in  and have gone on to go to college or get jobs.The current group of visitors will now make way for a new group who will begin their five years of summer respite next year. They will come from Kilmavichy, reached by passing the highly contaminated town of Veprin, where in  just six of the  children living there were classed as lsquohealthyrsquo.Meanwhile Mr Turnbull is preparing for his th trip to Belarus to deliver a new wave of support in the form of food and vitamins for its children.ldquoWhen we went years ago, the people would tell us that we were the first visitors they had seen since the disaster, he says.ldquoThey thought the world had forgotten them.

Scotland was the first nation in the world to declare that the climate crisis has reached such a point that it now represents an emergency of planetary scale. The show of leadership was followed by countries, cities and organisations across the world making similar declarations.Scotland should also now lead in its response to the climate emergency.The Scottish Government has made welcome commitments to action on climate change, legislating for a pathway to net-zero emissions by , planning to create a Green New Deal for Scotland, and a commitment that next weekrsquos Programme for Government will have climate at its core.The Climate Emergency Response Group of civic and business leaders was formed to use our expertise and influence and support the Scottish Government by setting out what we believe are some of the key actions that are urgently needed to take to translate commitments into concrete policies.The climate emergency requires urgent practical leadership, with new and accelerated policies, initiatives, regulation and investment.Today our group published its recommendations. These are steps that can immediately be implemented, are equal to the scale of the climate crisis and will help make Scotland a better place to live and work.With most buildings in Scotland still heated by fossil fuels and many of them leaky and inefficient, changing how we heat our homes is a key next step for Scotlandrsquos journey to net-zero climate emissions.A heat pump sector deal should be created to accelerate the adoption of electric heating from modern, efficient heat pumps and to maximise the opportunities for economic growth found in manufacture and installation.Between now and  we need to retrofit the vast majority of our existing buildings to make them zero-carbon. This means accelerating the Scottish Governmentrsquos energy efficiency programme, using regulation and public funding to improve our leaky and draughty buildings.Unbelievably, we are adding to this retrofit task every year, by putting up new buildings that are not zero-carbon, despite the technology being available and the costs being marginal.From now on, Scottish building standards should ensure that all new homes are zero-carbon rated, and that buildings undergoing any major refurbishment have their carbon emissions improved.These policies will mean people living warmer, more comfortable lives with lower fuel bills.Scotlandrsquos land has a vital role to play in our climate emergency response.Regional land-use plans can ensure that every part of Scotlandrsquos land contributes, whether that is through the recovery and restoration of natural habitats, the replanting of forests, or through efficient and climate-friendly productive agriculture.Our farmers need a helping hand with this vital role. Grants, loans and funding for training opportunities should be increased, helping farmers purchase new machinery and equipment that enables them to be more efficient and precise in bringing about a climate-friendly modernisation of Scottish agriculture.Public guidance on diets that are sustainable, climate-friendly and healthy should provide us all with expert advice that helps us reduce our impact on the climate.Achieving all these changes to our lives requires investment and we should begin by harnessing what the public sector already spends.Every year, the Scottish public sector spends pound billion, which should be mobilised to develop demand for new climate-friendly products, business and services.Similarly, the new Scottish National Investment Bank should have the climate emergency in its DNA ndash its project investments must be consistent with Scotlandrsquos climate goals.Climate change should be at the heart of Scotlandrsquos economic strategy.A new set of Green City Region Deals can fund the infrastructure that will enable the transformation of our cities, increasing productivity, making them healthier, more attractive and more liveable. Signalling that Scotlandrsquos city centres will be vehicle-emission free by  will drive the market for zero-emission vehicles, while also supporting public transport, walking and cycling.A focus on establishing Scotland as a global centre of net-zero industrial expertise will provide our best chance of competing in global industrial markets ndash and our group has recommended the establishment of a public-interest company that can develop the necessary infrastructure for commercial carbon capture and storage as a first step.These are our recommendations. They respond to the climate crisis and they are actions that will benefit the economy and people of Scotland.More will be required, but transformative actions like these are needed now. We are already witnessing the effects of climate change around the world and here in Scotland.The International Panel on Climate Change has said we have just  years to get ourselves on a pathway that avoids breaching . degrees of warming ndash which would be a disaster for people and for nature.Thatrsquos only , working days, an extreme timescale that must massively accelerate action.

The banner in its true meaning is calling for English institutions like Westminster, the Bank of England, the BBC, the English Monarchy and the Ministry of Defence at Faslane with Trident to leave Scotland so that we are no longer a province of England, no longer a colony of England.With regard to English people who live, work and retire in Scotland, they are always welcome. It is a mark of the timidity of some that such a banner has been unfairly criticised when Boris Johnson when Editor of the Spectator in  allowed a poem to be published that talked about putting the Scots in ghettoes and calling for our extermination and hardly an eyebrow was raised.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed.

Christ, how many times  IT’S RAPE, you troglodytes.However discomfiting these examples may be, they have nothing on the disingenuous coverage of Boris Johnson’s encounters with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron. I mean, we could all see him sitting beside Merkel as protesters screamed “Liar” and “Stop Brexit” we could all see him stick his feet up on Macron’s side table like a self-entitled brat .The most inexperienced of analysts would have understood that turning up in Berlin with bluster and braggadocio, but no actual plan B was hardly a masterstroke and that Merkel and Macron’s agreement to give him a month to come up with aalternative was just a tactic to keep him occupied while they get on with important affairs of state.And yet the Express and the– cheerleaders for the worst Prime Minister in history – presented his bilateral talks as a triumph. The Express carried a photo of him raising his arms behind a fence with the headline “Brexit Victory Salute”, ashe were Winston Churchill giving his “Finest Hour” speech rather than a floppy-haired fop back from a European jolly. Thewent with the headline “Johnson Demands Fresh Border Plan”while columnists lined up to explain how he had seen off Macron’s attempts to intimidate him and had reset the EU negotiations. Neither paper pointed out that Macron reiterated that the Irish backstop was “indispensable” and that this is the position they have held ever since Theresa May’s withdrawal deal was negotiated.Their spin – or as Byrne would doubtless prefer us to frame it, “lie” – would be troubling at the best of times but as we are hurtling towards a No Deal, it is utterly irresponsible. At a time when journalists should be pointing out the perils of his misplaced ebullience, many are egging him on, feeding his self-delusion.In her MacTaggart Lecture, Byrne called out the inadequacy of much of our current news coverage and scrutinised some of the reasons for it. She blamed our contemporary leaders – May, Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn – for refusing to submit themselves to scrutiny as previous leaders including Margaret Thatcher did, and went on to compare the way Johnson does his own pieces to camera as Vladimir Putin-style politics.But she also castigated news organisations for believing audiences no longer crave forensic investigations and for talking down to young people. Citing Carole Cadwalladr’s Facebook Cambridge Analytica investigation and the popularity of hard-hitting podcasts, she said there was still an appetite for in-depth exposés, although she didn’t point out that they require resources as well as courage – and that such resources are not widely available.Finally, Byrne talked fearlessly about the need for more ersity: for more women, certainly but much more pressingly for more BAME employees. Although she rejected the phrase “pale, male and stale”, pointing out that many middle-aged white men make excellent programmes, she said TV made by a clique of posh boys was never going to challenge the status quo. “When you change who is making TV, you change TV,” she said.Much of what Byrne raised, we see in action every day the cabal of male presenters who revel in their outmoded attitudes . And the courting of a younger demographic with nattily-dressed presenters, bite-sized news items and YouTube influencers when what many of those who are politically engaged want is to be confronted with new perspectives on giant issues such as climate change. There are exceptions, of course: Jon Snow stands out as a journalist willing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy, and Five Live journalist Emma Barnett has earned a reputation for skewering political interviewees.But time and time again, especially in  shows and radio phone-ins, broadcasters yield to the demand of  balance, treating journalism as a stand-off between two opposing sides rather than a quest for truth. Nor is BBC Scotland immune to these problems though much of the new channel’s output has been admirable, it is still overwhelmingly white. Meanwhile, The Nine has twice invited alt-right mouthpiece Brendan O’Neill to spout his anti-scientic climate change-denying views. Shouldn’t we be better than this As the spectre of a no-deal Brexit casts its increasingly dark shadow, there does appear to be a collective raising of the game. Over the past week or so, the BBC has been running a series of news packages analysing what a no-deal Brexit might mean in terms of the supply of fuel and medicine and the slaughter of animals that can no longer be exported.But as Byrne says, whatever happens with Brexit, our country is undergoing seismic changes and our broadcasters must do much morethey are to play a crucial role in holding those responsible to account. “We must find courage in this time of crisis,” the Scot said. “We must unite to use the power of television to protect democracy because it is being seriously undermined.” The following day, the Express gave its default response, which was to refer to “an online backlash” invisible to all but them.As Johnson engages in some pre-US trade talk willy-waving – insisting he will tell the US president “the NHS is not on the table” – Byrne’s rallying cry could not be more relevant. As men who couldn’t be trusted to tie their own shoelaces set the global agenda, the public is being failed. We need journalists to be less cowed. But we also need broadcasting companies to be willing to take risks, and newspaper owners to be interested in the actual news. And we need this to happen sooner rather than later.

Please note before I go any further that the information is released by the Scottish Government it is prepared by its own statisticians and carries with it the First Minister’s seal of approval, even though she could not be bothered to give this key publication the time of day. Over the years the methodology has been refined to take account of any possible gaps in the information presented, while politically motivated hoaxes, such as the whisky export tax, or “missing” allocations of public spending projects like Crossrail and HS have been debunked. Importantly, allowance is also made for looking at the figures with or without tax revenues from oil and gas production.The essential finding was that for the period of - Scotland had a public sector deficit of £. billion, slightly down on the year before. Average tax revenue per head was demonstrated to be £ lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, while spending per head has climbed to £,. Put together, these two figures define the fiscal transfer of £, per man woman and child that takes place seamlessly between the UK Treasury and the Scottish Government, including apportioned UK spending for defence and other mutual services Scotland benefits from.By themselves the GERS figures cannot and do not sayan independent Scotland could be economically sustainable. What they tell us is where the likely starting point would be were we to decide to leave the UK, before any changes could be made in Scottish government policy to alter the existing landscape. There would be notional Scottish spending of £.bn supported by an income of only £.bn – giving the estimated deficit of £.bn. Against Scotland’s Gross Domestic Productthe deficit was  per cent, compared to a deficit of . per cent for the UK. To put this in context Scotland would have the largest deficit as a share of GDP in the developed world, certainly the worst in Europe and way beyond the EU’s guideline limit of  per cent for its members.Taking account of the regional figures available via the UK’s Office of National Statistics there can be no doubt that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide a deficit against England’s surplus that leaves the whole UK in deficit, albeit reducing. Given the foregoing, Scotland’s receipt of this fiscal transfer is obviously not unique, indeed within England itself the tax revenues from the three regions of London, the South East and East notionally transfer to support all the other English regions, including the North West, North East, Yorkshire and West Midlands.This is the nature of fiscal transfers, where economically prosperous nations or regions fund a pool that is used to support those parts of the UK that are enduring harder times. Contributions and withdrawals to and from this pool will y over time, with some requiring help one year – or even decades – while at other times being the source of community municence.It is dangerous to justy participation in a country purely on economic terms while ignoring the greater historical, social and cultural bonds or strategic interests that make an entity greater than the sum of its parts. It is a good thing that when oil revenues collapsed the UK was able to ensure there was no catastrophic impact on Scottish public finances – as there would have beenScotland had voted for independence in . It is not a good thing for Scotland to run a large deficit and be reliant on the UK to make that forever possible.To justy Scotland’s place in the UK because it receives a “union idend” of nearly £, per person is like accelerating towards a blind summit, unaware of the hard landing that awaits politically.If unionists rely upon a figure to define the union idend then they must accept that correspondingly there will in some years be a union premium – a time when Scotland’s allocated tax revenues are greater than the spending it makes. Personally, I think this is a good thing, for it is what the union idend is really all about. It is a process, not a number a process that is built upon British solidarity, a shared experience of helping each other in times of great need from our hardest endeavours, creative genius or even just fortunate bounty.Indeed we can see from the official figures over the last  years that there have been times when Scotland has contributed to the maintenance of the UK and others when it has itself been supported. Since  Scotland has contributed a net £bn to the UK in real terms – a figure that shall undoubtedly be cancelled out by next year’s GERS figures. I know it is hard to imagine at a time when the SNP Scottish Government demonstrates with impressive regularity its ability to miscalculate it own economic forecasts and deliver poorer results in too many sections of the pubic services year-on-year – but the deficit could eventually change were the politicians to alter their centralising and incompetent ways.The private sector of the Scottish economy does relatively well despite the Scottish Government, rather than because of it. It could, with a change towards lower taxes and fewer regulations, achieve greater results and therefore contribute higher revenues while spending is restrained. When that day comes where stands the argument about the union idendit is measured by price alone How then will the argument fare that we should remain in the UK because of the Union Dividend when the GERS figures allow the SNP to complain about a similarly ridiculous “Union Premium”  Unionist politicians should stop focussing on the number and start concentrating on the shared benefits of giving and receiving help amongst people that have more in common than drives them apart. They should instead talk about how the deficit is reduced and how Scotland can help the weaker parts of the Union just as we have been helped when we needed it.Brian Monteith MEP is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

While it is yet to be approved at Holyrood’s business bureau, the motion is expected to say: “That the Scottish Parliament agrees that the UK should in no circumstances leave the EU on a no-deal basis.”Mr Russell said: “When the new session starts we will be less than two months away from a catastrophic no-deal which the UK government appears now to be actively pursuing.“It is essential that the Scottish Parliament has the opportunity to have its say while there is still time to stop this disaster from happening.

If the SNP and Labour believe that a no-deal would be as bad as they say it is, they need to explain why they have continually blocked attempts to get a deal over the line.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie both confirmed their parties would back the motion. Mr Rennie said: “The overwhelming majority of the public across the whole of the UK are opposed to a no-deal Brexit.“This parliamentary debate is an opportunity for all parties to come together and urge the Prime Minister to change course.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

These included the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the Countryside Alliance Ireland, NI Master of Hounds and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, all of whom allegedly received invitations before Easter.Janice Watt from the League Against Cruel Sports said: “It’s clear from the meeting today that many farmers are frustrated by the way the hunts are acting. The majority do not give permission for hunting to take place on their land, yet trespass and damage by huntsmen are all too common. “Some farmers have told us that after they banned hunts from their land they were threatened and intimidated, which is completely unacceptable. “st century farms have no need for fox hunting, as has been made clear today. Claiming that farmers need their assistance was the last argument available to hunters, but today’s conference has proven that it is not true. It is time this barbaric, unnecessary blood-sport was banned in Northern Ireland.”“Political representatives from most parties attended, including Sean Rodgers , Jim Wells , Patrick Brown , Henry Reilly , Robert Burgess . The meeting was also attended by the PSNI who provided invaluable advice to everyone who attended. “Hunting with dogs remains legal in N. Ireland, despite a recent poll showing that only one in five people believe it should be. As part of their Election Manesto, the League have asked all electoral candidates to pledge to support introducing legislation to ban fox and stag hunting in N. Ireland, which has already be banned in England Scotland and Wales for over  years.Steven McLinn, a farmer attending the session said: “Farmers are fed up with the hunts treating our land as their own.

We can manage our land perfectly well without them, so it’s time they stopped harassing us. “We are extremely disappointed that the relevant organisations who signed up to the Hunting Memorandum of Understanding failed to attend the meeting despite being asked. “They have let down the farming community badly and we would like them to at least acknowledge our plight and find a solution to address the issue of Hunt trespass, harassment and intimidation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Co Down man is seeking the help of News Letter readers in adding some elusive historical items to his growing collection.People,  ..Open Day raises over pound,Holstein NI#s fourth annual open day, which was held in Banbridge, has raised a staggering #, for three cancer charities.Health,  ..Revealed: the  NI sights on Lonely Planetrsquos ultimate UK travel guideThe Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.People,  ..

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"front door side door always a welcome","story":"BORN and bred in North Belfast, Brendan Rafferty is a well-known figure to many in the food and catering industry. With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: “The Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.“The previous owner’s menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn’t right so I changed the menu about a bit.“I had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.“The pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.”Brendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.“I would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,” he added.“Everything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.“I used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.“I was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.”As for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.“The food industry has changed massively over the years,” he explained.“Themes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.“Food takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.“There are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.“I probably wouldn’t have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.”Looking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.“Glengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.“I think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not – what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.“I believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.“As for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.“Customers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.”Brendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38415041.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/poll.jpg","title":"brexit poll saying majority backs irish sea border rejected by dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":null,"title":"only 6 of crossborder traders prepared for nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The trade body found that just % of cross-border traders are prepared for cash flow and liquidity issues in the event of a no-deal Brexit.They have urged business owners to take steps to protect themselves.Aidan Gough, InterTradeIreland’s designated officer and director of strategy and policy, said: “Ignoring Brexit is a bigger issue than not preparing for it.“Failing to take into account how it may impact your business could be very detrimental down the line.”There are about , cross-border traders on the island of Ireland.A substantial proportion of these are micro-businesses, which are particularly vulnerable to changes in current trading arrangements and are more likely to be reliant on the cross-border market as their only export destination.The latest research also shows continuity of supply is an additional problem that could hinder cross-border businesses and the ability to trade, but fewer than one in ten have taken steps to interrogate their supply chain.Tarfs are a further issue that could strike at the viability of SMEs  in the event of a hard Brexit.InterTradeIreland’s latest business monitor highlighted that just % of SMEs that trade across the border have looked at the possible impact of extra taxes on their business.Mr Gough said that InterTradeIreland has launched a new campaign to encourage cross-border traders to plan for Brexit, adding that the research underlines the need for companies to start acting now.“We want to reach as many SMEs as possible to help them prepare, that’s why InterTradeIreland is launching our new campaign,” he added.“This will be a signicant departure for InterTradeIreland.“It recognises that Brexit is the elephant in the room and with the deadline of October  fast approaching, Brexit is now just too big to brush under the carpet.“We think this approach and striking visuals will resonate with busy firms on many levels.”InterTradeIreland highlighted its online Bitesize Brexit, a tool for cross-border traders which details specic actions that businesses can take to prepare for Brexit.In a statement from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, a spokeswoman said it has been working with companies for more than two years to raise awareness of the key Brexit challenges.The statement said: “The department’s ongoing engagement and research indicates that the proportion of businesses preparing for Brexit is increasing, particularly among those businesses identied as most exposed to Brexit-related impacts, and that awareness of the key Brexit challenges is also increasing.“Almost % of Irish SMEs report a good understanding of the likely implications of Brexit impacts that are relevant to their business.”The department said that a survey carried out in February this year suggested that planning for Brexit is increasing, with almost half of SMEs saying they have taken “some form of engagement” to prepare for Brexit.“Among the most impacted businesses, progress is also being made, for example more than half of exporters indicate that they have a Brexit plan,” the statement added."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over. Unfortunately, this wider issue cannot be addressed without a Stormont minister in place.Cllr Andrews said he and Mr McGrath have raised the Mary Street problem with Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials and the Housing Executive in a bid to determine ownership of the Mary Street paths and an adjacent alleyway.He added: ldquoWe have undertaken this course of action to ensure that the adequate response is made and the area cleaned up as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Comber man taking on 28k mountain trail to raise funds for local charities  ","story":"A COMBER man has challenged himself to run a tough k mountain trail to raise cash for charities, including Cancer Focus Northern Ireland.Daniel Heaney is getting fitter by the day and is raring to hit the Wicklow Trail Run in September.Daniel works for Troup Bywaters and Anders, which is pledging to raise pound, for local charities to mark their th year in Belfast.Cancer Focus NI also celebrates a big birthday ndash the charity has been helping local cancer patients and their families in Northern Ireland for the past  years.For Daniel, running is a way to be a part of the challenge and do his bit to help his company reach their target.ldquoIn the last year I have completed  runs, running just over  kilometres.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them. They started to fish about  yards offshore, but it was when they decided tohome that they hit trouble.They struggled to make any headway against the strong outgoing tide. ldquoWe just drted further and further away until the shore was just a haze, Philip said.They did not realise, as they drted six miles out to sea, that the alarm had been raised and the Newcastle leboat was on its way to their rescue, along with the helicopter..ldquoThe helicopter circled over us until the leboat came, Philip continued. ldquoThey took us on board and gave us hot soup and a tot of rum.ldquoI donrsquot think we have ever been so glad to see anyone in our lives.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

The party never does anything on the spur of the moment.Everything is thought through. A few weeks earlier, as the RHI saga was beginning to gather a little momentum, all he asked for was Arlene Foster to stand aside for a brief period. At that moment there was no sense of Sinn Fein giving up on the devolution project. Indeed, had she nominated someone to stand in for herit seems likely that all would have ed to what passes for normal pretty quickly.But the resignation letter indicated the sheer scale of Sinn Fein’s dficulty with the DUP. When I read the full text I remember commenting – on Talkback, I think – that it could be a very long time before the institutions were ing again. For years both the DUP and Sinn Fein had dismissed articles I had written about the ‘toxicity at the heart of the relationship between them’but from late January  they were not dismissing those of us who were warning about the long-term dficulties.But what did Sinn Fein imagine was going to happen after the publication of the letter  They couldn’t have foreseen the ‘crocodile’ comment from Arlene Foster a few months later. They couldn’t have taken it for granted that there would be an early Assembly election, let alone that they would run the DUP so close, or that unionism would lose its overall majority. They couldn’t have known that an early general election would place the DUP in the role of kingmaker at Westminster, meaning that there would be no particular pressure on Foster to cut an Assembly deal. So again, what was Sinn Fein thinking in January  .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button What had become clear fairly soon after Arlene Foster replaced Peter Robinson as DUP leader and first minister in January  was, that from McGuinness’s perspective, something had changed. He had been able to reach a personal and political modus vivendi with Ian Paisley and Peter Robinson, but not, it seems, with Foster. There were also rumblings of concern from within elements of Sinn Fein’s grassroots about Foster and her ‘obvious problem with Sinn Fein’. But even with all of that there was still the sense that he was trying to offer her wriggle-room after the RHI Spotlight programme in December .Is it fair to conclude that her rejection of that offer was a final straw for him  His own decision to stand down had been taken by that stage – although it’s not clear how many people knew how close to death he was. It’s also not clear whether his resignation letter was a deliberate attempt to bring down the institutions, or just an attempt to put the sort of pressure on herthat would force a rethink on standing aside. As I say, I don’t know the answer: but I do know that the contents of the letter changed the dynamics between both parties and exposed fault lines that had mostly been hidden – even from their own grassroots.The other thing that still puzzles me is the role of an Irish language actin the talks process. Both parties signed up to Programmes for Government in ,  and , with barely a mention of it. In the summer of  the DUP was taking soundings across unionism and sections of civic society about accommodating a possible ILA, but opinion I was hearing from within unionism suggested very little support. Yet it was clear that it was being talked about during the talks process in the autumn winter of  early . Why  Did the DUP think they could sell something to their public representatives and grassroots  Did they convey that impression to Sinn Fein and both governments  I accept the DUP statement from February  that they had not signed off on a deal that included an ILA that said, why did they let the issue run for so long in that key moment of the talks process Had the DUP agreed to an ILA it seems fairly certain that Arlene Foster would have been accepted again as first minister. It also seems certain that Sinn Fein would have rowed back on issues like changes to the Petition of Concern, same-sex marriage and abortion reform. Indeed, the response from most commentators to the talks papers leaked to and published by Brian Rowan and Eamonn Mallie was that the DUP had come out on top. Where are we now  Sinn Fein seems to have shted its attention almost entirely to the unity project and a border poll and is very unlikely to change its mind on an ILA. The DUP may have major problems with a backstop and no dealand I think it knows its grassroots wouldn’t be prepared to swallow an ILA. Yet both parties, albeit for mutually contradictory reasons, may be nudging towards rebooting the institutions. Sinn Fein took an electoral hit in the south a few weeks ago and some evidence suggests the absence of devolution and power-sharing here damaged them. The DUP may not be kingmaker in Westminster for much longer and will want a powerbase in Stormont again.A huge concession is required from both Foster and Mary Lou McDonaldthat is to happen. How likely is that  And how would an Executiveagainst the backdrop of either a backstop hated by the DUP or no deal, no backstop and a new border, hated by Sinn Fein  The NIO and new SoS Julian Smith are talking up the prospects of a ed Assembly. I hope they’re not making the mistakes made in February .Ben Lowry: Small glimmer of hope for UK after Boris Johnson’s visits to EU capitals Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

Drivers make huge sacrices including being away from their families and missing many important events just to earn a living. A classic Woodside Brothers truck from the late s“However, when you ask any lorry driver how they find the job most will say that they are living the dream. It gets into your blood and once you’re a trucker you’ll always be one, nothing could ever replace it.”Of the changes to trucks over the years he said: “Many of the older folk would recall having to be able to fix the trucks as well as driving them, you were a mechanic as well as a driver, but nowadays they have to be plugged in so the computer can tell you what’s wrong with them.”Proceeds of the book will be going towards the Cancer Fund for Children and the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, a charity to help bring people home who have died abroad.The book, priced £, can be ordered via the

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.
