The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.\u0027There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/12/4C0BC59600000578-5712997-Weinstein_is_being_sued_in_several_different_states_although_cri-a-4_1525952066433.jpg","title":"Weinsteins lawyer blasts critics just not telling truth","story":"    Benjamin Brafman, Mr Weinstein\u0027s lawyer, said he believed some of the alleged victims \u0027simply aren\u0027t telling the truth\u0027          Weinstein is being sued in several different states - although criminal charges are yet to be brought against him (pictured with partner Georgina Chapman)\u0027Most people in my experience, and I was a prosecutor and a defendant of rape cases, most people who have actually been raped, the last thing they want to do is communicate with their rapist in any way that demonstrates affection, friendship or gratitude,\u0027 he added.  Weinstein is facing numerous lawsuits after more than 80 women accused him of sexual assault and harassment. In Manhattan, Weinstein has been accused of forcing actress Lucia Evans, then a college student, to perform oral sex on him inside his Tribeca office in 2004 and of raping Boardwalk Empire actress Paz de la Huerta on two occasions in 2010. Rapist movie director Roman Polanski dismisses the #MeToo...\u0027Trust that inner voice\u0027: Ronan Farrow says his career was...Grand jury in Manhattan considers sexual assault charges...Share this articleWeinstein has denied that he ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The former Hollywood producer, 66, is also being investigated by police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and London but has yet to be criminally charged in any jurisdiction. But Weinstein\u0027s lawyer, Mr Brafman, said that the nature of the evidence attached to some of the allegations against him meant that any trial would be based purely on hearsay.

They blindfolded and trussed me.I have no idea how long I was in the Thai secret prison because no one would let me sleep. \u0027The masked abductors were waiting. I was terrified. They chained me to the hooks. Because I was midway through my pregnancy, I could barely move or sit.\u0027Some of what they did to me in that prison was so awful I can’t talk about it. They hit me in the abdomen just where the baby was. To move me, they bound me to a stretcher from head to toe, like a mummy.

He said Mr Belhaj had never asked for money and will not receive any.In statements issued by their lawyers, Mr Belhaj and Ms Boudchar said they accepted the apology from Mrs May and the Government.Mr Wright told MPs it was important for the security services to learn from \u0027where we got things wrong\u0027, but said they were not admitting liability in a carefully worded statement.Mr Wright said the UK Government \u0027believes\u0027 the accounts and admitted Britain had \u0027contributed\u0027 to the appalling treatment they received.He said: \u0027We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal you suffered and our role in it.\u0027           The rendition came days before Tony Blair\u0027s \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 with  Muammar Gaddafi outside Tripoli in 2014 (pictured)  Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the agreement meant the Government did not have to admit any legal liability for what happened Hakim Belhaj and his wife while Theresa May also apologised (both pictured today)The Attorney General said he hoped the acknowledgement of what happened and the apology would ease the suffering Mr Belhaj and his wife. Mr Belhaj - a long-time opponent of Gaddafi - and his then-pregnant Moroccan wife claim they were kidnapped and tortured under the dictator\u0027s regime, when Jack Straw was the UK foreign secretary.           Abdel Hakim Belhaj, was the former leader of an Islamic militant group that sent fighters to Iraq and Afghanistan, who would later help overthrow GaddafiFollowing Mr Wright\u0027s statement, Mr Belhaj said via his lawyers: \u0027I welcome and accept the Prime Minister\u0027s apology, and I extend to her and the Attorney General my thanks and sincere goodwill.\u0027Ms Boudchar, who was in Parliament with her son to hear Mr Wright\u0027s statement, said: \u0027I thank the British Government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the Government\u0027s apology.\u0027Sapna Malik, from law firm Leigh Day, who represented Mr Belhaj and Ms Bouchar, said: \u0027Today\u0027s historic occasion is a tribute to the resilience of our clients in their quest for justice.\u0027After six long years of litigation, HM Government has rightly acknowledged that, even in the fields of counter-terrorism and international relations, there are lines which must not be crossed and which were crossed here, with devastating consequences for my clients.\u0027Today\u0027s candid apology from the Government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal and is warmly welcomed.\u0027 Mr Belhadj spent six years behind bars but is now a politician in Libya.The government had gone to the Supreme Court to stop Mr Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar suing over claims UK officials \u0027assisted and arranged\u0027 their unlawful rendition in 2004.  Jack Straw (left) could have faced legal action by Libyan dissident Abdel Hakim Belhaj (right) who claims the UK was complicit in his and his wife\u0027s abduction and rendition to Tripoli          Mr Belhaj - a leading member of the Islamist opposition to Colonel Gaddafi - and his wife have offered to settle for a token £1 from each defendant and an apology for what they sufferedThe couple claim the UK was involved in \u0027arranging, assisting and encouraging their unlawful rendition\u0027.According to Reprieve, part of the deal involved the illegal kidnapping and flying of Libyan dissidents to Tripoli.They say cases came to light in 2011, when faxes written by Sir Mark, which described the rendition flights, were found in Libya\u0027s intelligence headquarters. Giving his judgment at the Supreme Court, Lord Mance said: \u0027They allege that they suffered mistreatment amounting to torture at the hands of US agents in Bangkok and in the airplane and at the hands of Libyan officials in Libya.\u0027The judge said the couple were relying on the letter supposedly written by Sir Mark to Mr Moussa Koussa, head of the Libyan External Security Organisation.\u0027The letter congratulated Mr Moussa Koussa \u0027on the safe arrival of (Mr Belhaj)\u0027,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027It said that \u0027This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years\u0027.\u0027It indicated that British intelligence had led to Mr Belhaj\u0027s transfer to Libya, although the British services \u0027did not pay for the air cargo\u0027.\u0027 Government lawyers had argued that the Belhaj claims should be barred under state immunity.          Belhaj was allegedly transported to Libya and was tortured by forces of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi They said the foreign \u0027act of state\u0027 doctrine prohibits the courts of one country sitting in judgment on the acts of the government of another within its own territory.The High Court agreed with the Government\u0027s stance and ruled that the claims should be struck out.But Reprieve argued that the Government had already settled a related claim out of court by paying compensation to another family who were rendered to Libya in the same \u0027deal in the desert\u0027 conspiracy.The Court of Appeal then reversed the High Court ruling.It said the doctrine relied upon by the government might not apply to alleged breaches of international law or human rights obligations, even in cases involving the conduct of a foreign state.The appeal judges said there was a \u0027compelling public interest\u0027 in allegations of unlawful rendition and \u0027particularly grave violations of international law and human rights\u0027 being investigated by the English courts.UK Government lawyers then argued that the compensation claim could not be heard in a British court because it would damage relations with the US.But the argument was dismissed by the seven justices - court president Lord Neuberger, sitting with Lady Hale and Lords Mance, Clarke, Wilson, Sumption and Hughes. Lord Mance said that \u0027state immunity is no bar to the claims\u0027, and the defendants had not \u0027on the assumed facts shown any entitlement to rely on the doctrine of foreign act of state\u0027.He said: \u0027The appeals are dismissed and the cases may proceed to trial.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/00/4C092BD600000578-0-image-a-39_1525908606623.jpg","title":"Iraq used Baghdadi aides phone capture Islamic State commanders","story":"Captured Isis aide forced to snare fellow leaders | World | The Times"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

In order to avoid the social faux pas of using the couple\u0027s own downstairs loo, there is a \u0027guest toilet\u0027 too and even separate lifts – one for the family, the other for visitors. Upstairs has six bedrooms, all with en-suites, with the master bedroom also boasting a dressing room. The property has two floors as well as a subterranean basement, which is home to the steam room, plunge pool, hot tub, gym, cinema room with ten seats, wine cellar and snooker room with bar. The plush garage has room for six cars and the stables have room for 14 horses plus a hay store and a tack room. The plans were originally submitted in 2014 and given full approval by the local council before the property was bought by the Rooneys in 2017. A series of environmental surveys were carried out, including a check for protected bats and great-crested newts.           It is now unclear what he will do about the sprawling pile in Cheshire which he purchased for some £20million - a quarter of his estimated worth - where work is still underway          This is not their first redevelopment project.

It would have to be massive for him to want leave Everton,\u0027 the Toffees boss told talkSPORT. Allardyce and Rooney have had their differences and the player\u0027s show of dissent when substituted in April\u0027s Merseyside derby resulted in clear-the-air talks between the pair. Rooney is the club\u0027s top scorer this season with 11 goals but, as an indicator of where is and the club\u0027s form is, he has not scored since December 18. Allardyce has played him in a midfield role in the second half of the season in an attempt to inject some creativity into the team but that has impacted on the player\u0027s personal form and led to growing frustration. It comes after Rooney rejected the invitation to make a big-money switch to China after only one season back at his boyhood club. The family are understood to have been reluctant to relocate to the Far East. The striker, one of the Premier League\u0027s highest paid players on a reported £300,000 a week, is said to have amassed an £82million fortune from his wages, property portfolio and sponsorship deals. Neither Everton nor Rooney\u0027s agents were available for comment while sources at DC United said they did not comment on player speculation.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/18/4C05A6C900000578-0-image-a-32_1525886776739.jpg","title":"Blue collar workers flock Theresa fuel Tory lead","story":"    Data from YouGov suggest working class voters have surged to the Conservatives and now favour Mrs May\u0027s party by 43 per cent to 40 per cent.

Only three bodies of the kids have been foundLast month, officials said Jennifer Hart was drunk when she drove her large family off a cliff and her wife and several children had large amounts of a drug in their systems that can cause drowsiness.   Sarah Hart, along with at least two of the children, had \u0027significant\u0027 amounts of an ingredient found in Benadryl in their systems. Her blood alcohol content at the time of the crash was .102. Investigators have reason to believe the crash was intentional. Five members of the Hart family, parents Sarah  and Jennifer Hart and their adopted children Markis, Jeremiah and Abigail Hart, were dead inside the wrecked SUV.No one in the car was wearing a seat belt. On April 7, a bystander pulled a body from the surf near the site of the crash.  In this March 29, 2018, photo, Deputy Bill Holcomb looks down the cliff near the crash site near Mendocino, Calif., as search and rescue volunteers looked for the missing childrenThe body was later identified through DNA analysis as 12-year-old Ciera Hart.There are still two missing children, 15-year-old Devonte and 16-year-old Hannah.Police have said that data from the vehicle\u0027s software also suggested the crash was deliberate. Hart family\u0027s SUV was about 70 feet from the cliff\u0027s edge when Jennifer accelerated. She was driving somewhere between 20 to 30 mph when the car went off the cliff. They said the SUV had stopped at a coastal highway overlook before speeding straight off the cliff and plummeting 100 feet into the rocky Pacific Ocean below.The crash happened just days after authorities in Washington state opened an investigation following allegations the children were being neglected.KATU News has reported on a number of other incidents involving the Hart family that eventually led to an investigation by Washington State Child Protective Services.In 2017, one of the Hart children jumped out of a second-story window and begged her neighbors for help. She said her parents were racist, abusive and whipped her.In the weeks leading up to the crash, Devonte Hart went to his neighbor\u0027s house several times asking for food saying his parents were punishing him and not allowing him to eat.In 2013, a family friend said she \u0027witnessed what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment\u0027 toward the six children.Sarah Hart pleaded guilty to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota in 2011. Her plea also led to the dismissal of a charge of malicious punishment of a child.One of her daughters, who was 6 years old at the time, showed her teacher she had bruising all over her back and torso.In 2008 in another report claimed Jennifer beat her daughter using a belt. When confronted by officials, Jennifer and Sarah Hart said the little girl was misbehaving, and added she likely got her bruises from falling down the stairs."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/22/4C12632B00000578-5715701-image-a-2_1525989343225.jpg","title":"Dashboard cam captures duty deputy save babys life","story":"    This is the moment an off-duty deputy saved a baby\u0027s life after being flagged down by a woman for help          Distraught mom Nechole Crowell flagged down K9 Deputy Jeremie Nix in Ocala on Wednesday around 5:30pm          Crowell rushed out of the vehicle with baby King and another woman got out of the driver\u0027s seat to assistWhen the officer wasn\u0027t noticing an improvement in King\u0027s breathing, he hurried back into his vehicle and took off to the nearby Ocala Regional Medical Center.The Marion County Sheriff\u0027s Office shared heartwarming updates about baby King\u0027s state afterward.\u0027Deputy Nix delivered the child to medical personnel, who then began treating the child.

Indeed, he claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997. Rex uses the reclining naked photograph on his Twitter home page where he also likes to post crude jokes. In a reference to engagement rings, he wrote the other day: ‘The bigger the diamond, the smaller the d***.’Elsewhere there is a picture of him posing in a Coca-Cola costume carrying the caption: ‘I think I have a coke problem.’All in all, he seems the unlikeliest of romances for Ms Markle. But according to the Sun newspaper, the two enjoyed a date in 2004 when Meghan was 22 and taking her very first steps as a professional actress with walk-on parts in daytime television.          Simon Rex of Dirt Nasty performs at the world famous Roxy theater in Los Angeles, CA          Simon \u0027Dirt Nasty\u0027 Rex (centre) arrives at the grand opening of the Sapphire Pool \u0026amp Day Club on May 3, 2013 in Las Vegas, NevadaThey are said to have met on the set of a long-forgotten U.S. sitcom called Cuts when they both had roles in the same episode.He was already a successful model appearing in ads for Calvin Klein, Versace and Levi’s while Meghan was still a year away from her first regular-money role as a ‘briefcase girl’ — holding up a case full of cash — on game show Deal Or No Deal.Of his past as a porn star — he was 18 and 19 when he made the films — he says it was to pay the bills.‘I went there and did that s***,’ he said in a 2014 interview. ‘It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment.’He added: ‘In hindsight, it wasn’t the best move.’For Meghan, Rex’s moment of regret will barely register. Instead, any lingering hopes she may have had that her past life would remain off limits as she completes her transformation from Hollywood starlet to royal princess must surely now have vanished.If it’s any comfort, the Royal Family will scarcely raise an eyebrow at the revelations. As one figure close to the Royals told me: ‘It’s a horrid little betrayal, but it won’t damage her reputation. She’s not a virginal bride like Diana, who was only just out of her teens when she married Charles, but a mature woman of experience with one failed marriage behind her.’  Paris Hilton and Simon Rex at the premiere of the \u0027Layer Cake\u0027 film in January 2005 (left). Paris Hilton and Simon Rex on the set of Pledge This! in Miami, Florida in August 2004The disclosures have come from Ninaki Priddy, once an inseparable friend of Meghan to whom she had been ‘like a sister’. But their relationship is long over. Since Meghan’s engagement to Harry she has spilled just about every intimate bean of their 30-year friendship.It was Ms Priddy, you may recall, who revealed to royal biographer Andrew Morton that Meghan ‘was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.’ Yet what emerges from these revelations is a picture of Meghan who, as a young woman, was not quite the confident and sophisticated figure whom Harry fell in love with. Meghan was vulnerable and as likely as any other twentysomething to chance her luck in the dating stakes.Until now it had been thought that, for all her beauty, Meghan had been linked to only a handful of men, apart from her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson and the Canadian chef who replaced him in her affections.There had been the boy with whom she shared a first kiss, a high-school sweetheart, and a couple of others, none serious. But now we learn that she had a dating bible called The Rules, a self-help book aimed at women who want ‘marriage in the shortest time possible’. Meghan studied the book — an instant bestseller when it came out in the mid-Nineties — so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.    Interestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capitalInterestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capital.Looking back, it does seem these men were little more than footfalls in her romantic history. By 2004, she was with TV producer Engelson. In 2010, they were engaged and wed the following year, to separate two years later.Ms Priddy claims that her friend had put ‘all The Rules into play with Trevor’.She had apparently met a fortune teller in Argentina who told her she would marry a man with ‘curly red hair’. Engelson, of course is not the only figure in her life to have reddish hair. So, too, does Prince Harry.Next week she will have pushed the far-from-welcome disclosures to the back of her mind as family and friends see them marry.Her old friend Ninaki will not be there. She did not make the guest list.  The rule book secrets that helped her bewitch a Prince For every young girl who dreams of growing up and marrying a handsome Prince, there is one burning question. How did Meghan do it?Just how did this 36-year-old American orcee and small-screen actress capture the eye of Prince Harry?Now we know the answer. One of her childhood friends, Ninaki Priddy, this week said Meghan swore by a self-help book called The Rules: Time-tested Secrets For Capturing The Heart Of Mr Right.Although a bestseller, the book came in for criticism over its anti-feminist message. It advises women to be subservient, let the man to lead the conversation and to never, ever sleep with him until you’ve had at least three dates.There’s also a chapter on how to attract a high-profile man — along with other rules Meghan may have found useful . . .SNARING YOUR VIPWhat follows are The Rules for meeting and dating celebrities and business bigwigs. Assuming the VIP spoke to you first, here’s what to do and what not to do:1. Take a deep breath. Stay composed.2. Treat him as you would any other man, not the movie star or business tycoon he is.3. Do not stare at him4. Do not light up or act giddy, as if you just won the lottery.5. Act as if you’ve been out of the country for the last three years and you’re not quite sure who he is, even if he was just on the cover of People magazine.6. Don’t ask for his autograph.7. Don’t compliment him.8. Don’t show any interest in his career.9. If you’re an aspiring actress, do not ask for an audition.10. Do not ask him to do you a favour, such as donate money to your favourite charity.11. Act interested but not spellbound. Leave him alone. After five minutes of conversation about whatever he wants to talk about, say: ‘Oh, look at the time, I must leave now. It was nice meeting you.’ And walk away.12. Do not seem impressed by his limousine or entourage.13. Once you are dating a celebrity, don’t see him whenever and wherever it’s convenient for him because he has a busy schedule. 14. It’s tempting to drop your friends and family and revolve your whole life around this famous man. You must still live your own life, see him two to three times a week — until he proposes.15. If he’s widely popular, expect that other women might write to him, call him and throw themselves at him. Do not get angry or show jealousy or insecurity. Do not be possessive in public. If he pursued you, their advances won’t matter. He’ll still want you.16. Be discreet. Do not call the tabloids and tell them you’re dating, as a way of announcing to other women that he’s your man. That would be self-serving, possibly hurtful or embarrassing to him, and might ruin any chances of his continuing to see you.17. Don’t try to become too friendly with his staff in an effort to keep tabs on him or so they put in a good word for you.18. Don’t seem overly interested in his wealth or the limelight. Rules girls are not groupies.DON’T RUSH INTO SEXYou will have to exercise a bit of self-restraint and trust that if you hold off for a few weeks or months you won’t be sorry. Why risk having a man call you easy?It can be excruciating to put off sex with someone you’re attracted to but you must think long-term.Let’s say that now, hopefully, you’ve held off for a while and are ready to have sex with him.What Rules should you follow? First and foremost, stay emotionally cool no matter how hot the sex gets. The fact is that most women turn men off not only because they sleep with them too soon, but because they talk too much about it in bed.Don’t be a drill sergeant, demanding he do that or this. Being with you in bed should not be difficult or demanding.Don’t cling to him if he has to leave that night or the following morning.Be casual and unmoved about the fact the date is over — with that attitude chances are that he’ll be the one hanging on.LONG-DISTANCE LOVEHaving been introduced to someone who lives in a different city or country, Rules apply to making it work:Don’t call him. He calls you. Get off the phone in 20 minutes. If he wants to visit you on the weekend, he must ask you by Wednesday.If he suggests that you meet in his city, or halfway, say: ‘That sounds nice, but things are really hectic right now, I just couldn’t get away.’ He’ll realise that he has to visit you. If you travel to see him before he’s made at least three trips to see you, he won’t think you’re special, and will not pursue you in the future. The first three times he visits, he should not stay with you. The first three visits are really three dates . . . and on the first three dates we don’t have sex.The first three times, always see a little less of him than he would like. If he suggests flying in Friday night and leaving Sunday evening, say Saturday morning would be better and end on Sunday afternoon.After he has visited you three times, you can visit him once and stay at his place. If he offers to pay your travel costs, let him. If he doesn’t, don’t ask for the money but let him pay for everything when you’re there. If things get serious, he might ask if you would ever consider relocating.Until he actually gives you a ring, be vague. There’s no reason to relocate until you’ve set a wedding date.CLOSING THE DEALIf you have been following the Rules you will not only get a proposal but you will know where the relationship is going long before he pops the question. You will sense a warm, open feeling emanating from him, a desire to include you in his world.The way to get a man to ask you to marry him in a reasonable amount of time is not to live with him before you’re engaged, and to continue to see him only three times a week. There’s no cold feeling in Rules engagements. He’s made his decision, he wants to get married, to be with you all the time, for ever.The Complete Book Of Rules by Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider published by Thorson Element at £9.99 © Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider 2000."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/23/4C114B8900000578-5715915-image-a-55_1525990941928.jpg","title":"QUENTIN LETTS similarities President BoJo","story":"If the similarities between U.S. President Trump (left) and our Foreign Secretary (right) were not already strong enough, this week Boris, on a visit to the States, posed for a photograph with the President’s daughter Ivanka  Don’t tie me down: Wind plays havoc with neckwear, but they’re more worried about what’s going on up top  Clowning about: Both like their grub, are poor listeners and bad at detail.

The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb.Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027re-attached\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye.It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, the mother - known only as Patient A - came to face with Laxman and in a harrowing exchange across the room looked at her and said: \u0027I don\u0027t forgive you - I don\u0027t forgive you\u0027 as the doctor stared down at the floor. The patient then looked away as Laxman\u0027s QC apologised on her behalf.The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, and was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated.In heart breaking evidence Patient A, who was holding two teddy bears in her arms, told the hearing it was the first time she was due to give birth and added: \u0027I had been for a scan the previous Friday and I was told my son was breech and the nurse told me if anything had happened to my son it was going to be a c-section.Patients calling 999 will be told to show handlers a live...\u0027I won’t die for the NHS\u0027: Left-wing GP dubbed \u0027Red Robbo in...Women should convince doctors to give them HRT from age 45...Prosecutions of children possessing cannabis plummet as...Share this article\u0027But when I was taken to the labour suite nobody told me what was happening. A lot of people were talking they kept saying the baby needed to come out but nobody looked at me in the eye and told me what was going to happen.\u0027There were two doctors between my legs, one on my right hand side holding my hand and there were other people there too. I was examined by a doctor but she didn\u0027t say anything to me. They were checking for the baby\u0027s heartbeat and it had plummeted and that\u0027s when I was told it was going to come out.\u0027I remember them saying I was 2-3cm dilated and I was told to push. Nobody said I was not having a c-section and doing something else instead. Whilst this was going on I was in pain.\u0027The only pain relief I was given was a spray on my tongue. I was told it was meant to loosen my cervix but I was not given gas and air - I was in pain. I had the doctors putting their hands inside me and I had them pushing on my stomach and then pulling me down.\u0027I tried to get off the bed but they pulled me back three times and just said they had to get the baby out. They twice tried to cut my cervix and nobody told me they were going to do it. There was no anaesthetic. I said to them \u0027it doesn\u0027t feel right, stop it, what\u0027s going on, I don\u0027t want to do it\u0027 but nobody responded to me in any way.                            I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared                         - Patient A\u0027s statement to the tribunal \u0027Afterwards I was in a cubicle with a curtain around me and the sister came over to me and told me my son had passed away. I didn\u0027t know the details but Dr Laxman came to see me and the baby\u0027s father was there. Dr Laxman sat on the side of my bed and she said how sorry she was for what happened but I didn\u0027t know the full extent of what happened at that point.\u0027I just said \u0027it\u0027s alright, these things happen, I forgive you.\u0027 She went away but I started screaming when I found out the full extent - I was just crying. I was upset because of the severity of his injury.\u0027I would never use the word stillborn, he was not stillborn he was decapitated. I was pregnant, my first pregnancy I wasn\u0027t sure what was going on and I was told it was the safest place possible. Nobody explained the plan or risks associated. It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.\u0027Midwife Mona Chard said: \u0027I was aware she had palpable tightening and some bleeding and she was moved to the labour suite. There was a lot of discussion but I\u0027m not sure who was talking to who. I can\u0027t remember Dr Laxman having a conversation with a patient. I was trying to reassure the patient and comfort her. I remember looking round and people were shocked.\u0027The doctor came over to me and said Dr Laxman had decided there wasn\u0027t going to be a C section and I saw her pull the baby\u0027s feet and cord and she told the patient to push. That is something you cannot forget and Patient A was very distressed.\u0027The hearing was told the woman was given cocodamol before she was examined and Dr Laxman decided on a natural delivery. Lawyer for the General Medical Council Charles Garside QC said: \u0027They tried to coerce the birth through traction as the baby was coming feet first followed by the lower abdomen, upper abdomen and head.\u0027However, there was an obstruction during the birth which proved to be fatal. Dr Laxman allegedly delivered the legs, torso and arms successfully but whilst trying to deliver the head, it got stuck in the cervix.\u0027The attempt to manipulate the baby\u0027s head to come out of the cervix failed because the cervix has clamped onto the baby\u0027s head and despite effort made to assist, these efforts failed. Dr Laxman made three attempts to cut the cervix with scissors but Baby B\u0027s head was separated from his body and his head was stuck inside Patient A\u0027s body.\u0027The doctors had to arrange for the head to be removed. A Caesarean was then carried out - not by Dr Laxman who had become overcome by events - but by Dr C and Dr D, and his head was removed in that way.          The hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee (pictured) with a team of other doctors\u0027As a matter of compassion the head was reattached so the appearance of the baby was not too extreme. The baby was shown to his mother so she had the consolation of seeing him.\u0027Mr Garside added: \u0027At no stage was Patient A given any pain relief or instructed on when the c-section was being carried out. At no point did she try to comfort or consolidate or explain to Patient A what was going on.\u0027She failed to perform a Caesarean without general anaesthetic at a time when speed was needed. They should have carried out a category 1 Caesarean section. \u0027The baby had a heartbeat, it was slow, but it was not dead. The choice was taken by Dr Laxman to try a vaginal delivery and this was the wrong choice. They should never use a vaginal delivery in that situation.\u0027New babies are fragile, but this tiny baby was more fragile, and being pulled or twisted could do a lot more damage.\u0027Laxman, who faces being struck off, denies contributing to the death of the baby. Her lawyer Gerard Boyle QC addressed the mother during the hearing and told her: \u0027Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.\u0027She knows that no amount of words can or will soften your pain but she is hoping that knowing that what she was trying to do was her very best to deliver your baby quickly and sufficiently and she had best intentions at heart. \u0027She did not intend to harm you or harm your baby and she offers her apologies in every possible way. She hopes at some point in time that will make you feel in a way, slightly better.\u0027The hearing continues.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/16/4C0E4F2300000578-5713953-image-a-6_1525966456420.jpg","title":"Behind scenes footage shows Meghan Markle fits giggles set forgetting lines","story":"    Behind-the-scenes footage of Meghan Markle on the TV drama Suits shows the actress dissolving into fits of giggles, dancing around the set and fluffing her lines          Outtakes from the first six series, show the close friendship between the princess-to-be and her co-stars Patrick J Adams and Sarah Rafferty          The off-cuts of the hit series Suits, which can be found on YouTube , under the titles \u0027Blooper Reel\u0027 or \u0027Gag Reel\u0027 give a fascinating insight into Meghan\u0027s personalityWill Prince Harry shave off his beard in time for the big...The hazard of a dukedom: If Harry and Meghan really want to...Meghan and Harry bring New York to a stand still... sort of:...Share this articleBut she does not appear in as many clips as the rest of the cast, showing how seriously she took her big break in the profession.Meghan, 36, who marries Prince Harry next Saturday, joined Suits in 2011, moving from Los Angeles to Toronto.But she has now admitted that she thought she had blown her audition for the role of paralegal Rachel Zane in the show, originally entitled A Legal Mind.In an interview with listings magazine Fan The Fire, she said: \u0027It was just like any other audition.\u0027I was sent the material and was asked to go and read for the producers.

In order to avoid the social faux pas of using the couple\u0027s own downstairs loo, there is a \u0027guest toilet\u0027 too and even separate lifts – one for the family, the other for visitors. Upstairs has six bedrooms, all with en-suites, with the master bedroom also boasting a dressing room. The property has two floors as well as a subterranean basement, which is home to the steam room, plunge pool, hot tub, gym, cinema room with ten seats, wine cellar and snooker room with bar. The plush garage has room for six cars and the stables have room for 14 horses plus a hay store and a tack room. The plans were originally submitted in 2014 and given full approval by the local council before the property was bought by the Rooneys in 2017. A series of environmental surveys were carried out, including a check for protected bats and great-crested newts.           It is now unclear what he will do about the sprawling pile in Cheshire which he purchased for some £20million - a quarter of his estimated worth - where work is still underway          This is not their first redevelopment project. Their present home is on a 20-acre plot they bought before knocking down the existing property and replacing it with a building of their own design, which has two wings and has been dubbed \u0027Wayne\u0027s World\u0027. The Rooneys also have a £5million beachside property in Barbados. The 32-year-old forward told members of the Goodison Park hierarchy on Wednesday that he was ready to accept an offer that can be officially confirmed when the MLS transfer window opens on July 10. His agent, Paul Stretford, was in the US capital to discuss a contract that will run until the end of the 2020 MLS season.           Wayne Rooney is pictured at Chester racecourse on Thursday as news of his impending move to DC United was revealed          Last year it was revealed Rooney and his wife Coleen would be selling their current luxury home and building a new one entirely from scratchHowever, it has also been suggested uncertainty over manager Sam Allardyce\u0027s position means Rooney could yet stay at Goodison Park. Earlier this week Allardyce said he wanted England\u0027s and Manchester United\u0027s record goalscorer to see out the final year of his contract next season. \u0027There have been rumours about Wayne going abroad, China or America. It would have to be massive for him to want leave Everton,\u0027 the Toffees boss told talkSPORT. Allardyce and Rooney have had their differences and the player\u0027s show of dissent when substituted in April\u0027s Merseyside derby resulted in clear-the-air talks between the pair. Rooney is the club\u0027s top scorer this season with 11 goals but, as an indicator of where is and the club\u0027s form is, he has not scored since December 18. Allardyce has played him in a midfield role in the second half of the season in an attempt to inject some creativity into the team but that has impacted on the player\u0027s personal form and led to growing frustration. It comes after Rooney rejected the invitation to make a big-money switch to China after only one season back at his boyhood club. The family are understood to have been reluctant to relocate to the Far East. The striker, one of the Premier League\u0027s highest paid players on a reported £300,000 a week, is said to have amassed an £82million fortune from his wages, property portfolio and sponsorship deals. Neither Everton nor Rooney\u0027s agents were available for comment while sources at DC United said they did not comment on player speculation.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/09/4C01DB0E00000578-0-image-a-7_1525854584386.jpg","title":"Netanyahu says Iran crossed red line following Israeli missile launch","story":"Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) on TwitterFACTBOX: Five facts about the Golan Heights | ReutersIsrael security cabinet meets as Iranian official warns \u0027revenge will come\u0027 | The Times of IsraelIDF: Overnight raids set back Iranian military in Syria by \u0027many months\u0027 | The Times of Israel"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/10/20/4C0F64E600000578-5715057-image-a-26_1525979465804.jpg","title":"At soft landing Horse sends rider flying spectacular buck","story":"    Footage captures a rider sitting steadily on a horse as it trots through an obstacle course            When the female rider tries to approach a body of water for a second time the horse goes wildBut after realising the water isn\u0027t dangerous the horse gallops through the pond - making its rider hold on tighter to the reins.The horse then travels through the obstacle course again and seems to calm down after its moment of excitement.However, when the female rider tries to approach the body of water again the horse goes wild.Playful monkeys flock to Hindu temple and ring the bell by...Toilet humour!

Indeed, he claims to have won an award for Best Gay Solo Video in 1997. Rex uses the reclining naked photograph on his Twitter home page where he also likes to post crude jokes. In a reference to engagement rings, he wrote the other day: ‘The bigger the diamond, the smaller the d***.’Elsewhere there is a picture of him posing in a Coca-Cola costume carrying the caption: ‘I think I have a coke problem.’All in all, he seems the unlikeliest of romances for Ms Markle. But according to the Sun newspaper, the two enjoyed a date in 2004 when Meghan was 22 and taking her very first steps as a professional actress with walk-on parts in daytime television.          Simon Rex of Dirt Nasty performs at the world famous Roxy theater in Los Angeles, CA          Simon \u0027Dirt Nasty\u0027 Rex (centre) arrives at the grand opening of the Sapphire Pool \u0026amp Day Club on May 3, 2013 in Las Vegas, NevadaThey are said to have met on the set of a long-forgotten U.S. sitcom called Cuts when they both had roles in the same episode.He was already a successful model appearing in ads for Calvin Klein, Versace and Levi’s while Meghan was still a year away from her first regular-money role as a ‘briefcase girl’ — holding up a case full of cash — on game show Deal Or No Deal.Of his past as a porn star — he was 18 and 19 when he made the films — he says it was to pay the bills.‘I went there and did that s***,’ he said in a 2014 interview. ‘It was just enough to pay the rent at the time. I was living in the moment.’He added: ‘In hindsight, it wasn’t the best move.’For Meghan, Rex’s moment of regret will barely register. Instead, any lingering hopes she may have had that her past life would remain off limits as she completes her transformation from Hollywood starlet to royal princess must surely now have vanished.If it’s any comfort, the Royal Family will scarcely raise an eyebrow at the revelations. As one figure close to the Royals told me: ‘It’s a horrid little betrayal, but it won’t damage her reputation. She’s not a virginal bride like Diana, who was only just out of her teens when she married Charles, but a mature woman of experience with one failed marriage behind her.’  Paris Hilton and Simon Rex at the premiere of the \u0027Layer Cake\u0027 film in January 2005 (left). Paris Hilton and Simon Rex on the set of Pledge This! in Miami, Florida in August 2004The disclosures have come from Ninaki Priddy, once an inseparable friend of Meghan to whom she had been ‘like a sister’. But their relationship is long over. Since Meghan’s engagement to Harry she has spilled just about every intimate bean of their 30-year friendship.It was Ms Priddy, you may recall, who revealed to royal biographer Andrew Morton that Meghan ‘was always fascinated by the Royal Family. She wants to be Princess Diana 2.’ Yet what emerges from these revelations is a picture of Meghan who, as a young woman, was not quite the confident and sophisticated figure whom Harry fell in love with. Meghan was vulnerable and as likely as any other twentysomething to chance her luck in the dating stakes.Until now it had been thought that, for all her beauty, Meghan had been linked to only a handful of men, apart from her former husband, film producer Trevor Engelson and the Canadian chef who replaced him in her affections.There had been the boy with whom she shared a first kiss, a high-school sweetheart, and a couple of others, none serious. But now we learn that she had a dating bible called The Rules, a self-help book aimed at women who want ‘marriage in the shortest time possible’. Meghan studied the book — an instant bestseller when it came out in the mid-Nineties — so thoroughly she was able to recite passages off by heart.    Interestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capitalInterestingly, Meghan was also linked to another American who worked at the embassy. Or at least those are the rumours in the Argentine capital.Looking back, it does seem these men were little more than footfalls in her romantic history. By 2004, she was with TV producer Engelson. In 2010, they were engaged and wed the following year, to separate two years later.Ms Priddy claims that her friend had put ‘all The Rules into play with Trevor’.She had apparently met a fortune teller in Argentina who told her she would marry a man with ‘curly red hair’. Engelson, of course is not the only figure in her life to have reddish hair. So, too, does Prince Harry.Next week she will have pushed the far-from-welcome disclosures to the back of her mind as family and friends see them marry.Her old friend Ninaki will not be there. She did not make the guest list.  The rule book secrets that helped her bewitch a Prince For every young girl who dreams of growing up and marrying a handsome Prince, there is one burning question. How did Meghan do it?Just how did this 36-year-old American orcee and small-screen actress capture the eye of Prince Harry?Now we know the answer. One of her childhood friends, Ninaki Priddy, this week said Meghan swore by a self-help book called The Rules: Time-tested Secrets For Capturing The Heart Of Mr Right.Although a bestseller, the book came in for criticism over its anti-feminist message. It advises women to be subservient, let the man to lead the conversation and to never, ever sleep with him until you’ve had at least three dates.There’s also a chapter on how to attract a high-profile man — along with other rules Meghan may have found useful . . .SNARING YOUR VIPWhat follows are The Rules for meeting and dating celebrities and business bigwigs. Assuming the VIP spoke to you first, here’s what to do and what not to do:1. Take a deep breath. Stay composed.2. Treat him as you would any other man, not the movie star or business tycoon he is.3. Do not stare at him4. Do not light up or act giddy, as if you just won the lottery.5. Act as if you’ve been out of the country for the last three years and you’re not quite sure who he is, even if he was just on the cover of People magazine.6. Don’t ask for his autograph.7. Don’t compliment him.8. Don’t show any interest in his career.9. If you’re an aspiring actress, do not ask for an audition.10. Do not ask him to do you a favour, such as donate money to your favourite charity.11. Act interested but not spellbound. Leave him alone. After five minutes of conversation about whatever he wants to talk about, say: ‘Oh, look at the time, I must leave now. It was nice meeting you.’ And walk away.12. Do not seem impressed by his limousine or entourage.13. Once you are dating a celebrity, don’t see him whenever and wherever it’s convenient for him because he has a busy schedule. 14. It’s tempting to drop your friends and family and revolve your whole life around this famous man. You must still live your own life, see him two to three times a week — until he proposes.15. If he’s widely popular, expect that other women might write to him, call him and throw themselves at him. Do not get angry or show jealousy or insecurity. Do not be possessive in public. If he pursued you, their advances won’t matter. He’ll still want you.16. Be discreet. Do not call the tabloids and tell them you’re dating, as a way of announcing to other women that he’s your man. That would be self-serving, possibly hurtful or embarrassing to him, and might ruin any chances of his continuing to see you.17. Don’t try to become too friendly with his staff in an effort to keep tabs on him or so they put in a good word for you.18. Don’t seem overly interested in his wealth or the limelight. Rules girls are not groupies.DON’T RUSH INTO SEXYou will have to exercise a bit of self-restraint and trust that if you hold off for a few weeks or months you won’t be sorry. Why risk having a man call you easy?It can be excruciating to put off sex with someone you’re attracted to but you must think long-term.Let’s say that now, hopefully, you’ve held off for a while and are ready to have sex with him.What Rules should you follow? First and foremost, stay emotionally cool no matter how hot the sex gets. The fact is that most women turn men off not only because they sleep with them too soon, but because they talk too much about it in bed.Don’t be a drill sergeant, demanding he do that or this. Being with you in bed should not be difficult or demanding.Don’t cling to him if he has to leave that night or the following morning.Be casual and unmoved about the fact the date is over — with that attitude chances are that he’ll be the one hanging on.LONG-DISTANCE LOVEHaving been introduced to someone who lives in a different city or country, Rules apply to making it work:Don’t call him. He calls you. Get off the phone in 20 minutes. If he wants to visit you on the weekend, he must ask you by Wednesday.If he suggests that you meet in his city, or halfway, say: ‘That sounds nice, but things are really hectic right now, I just couldn’t get away.’ He’ll realise that he has to visit you. If you travel to see him before he’s made at least three trips to see you, he won’t think you’re special, and will not pursue you in the future. The first three times he visits, he should not stay with you. The first three visits are really three dates . . . and on the first three dates we don’t have sex.The first three times, always see a little less of him than he would like. If he suggests flying in Friday night and leaving Sunday evening, say Saturday morning would be better and end on Sunday afternoon.After he has visited you three times, you can visit him once and stay at his place. If he offers to pay your travel costs, let him. If he doesn’t, don’t ask for the money but let him pay for everything when you’re there. If things get serious, he might ask if you would ever consider relocating.Until he actually gives you a ring, be vague. There’s no reason to relocate until you’ve set a wedding date.CLOSING THE DEALIf you have been following the Rules you will not only get a proposal but you will know where the relationship is going long before he pops the question. You will sense a warm, open feeling emanating from him, a desire to include you in his world.The way to get a man to ask you to marry him in a reasonable amount of time is not to live with him before you’re engaged, and to continue to see him only three times a week.

Chingonyi, who is 31, is the first British poet to win the genre-straddling award, which has gone in the past to Max Porter’s novel Grief Is the Thing With Feathers and Fiona McFarlane’s short-story collection The High Places.This year, Chingonyi saw off a shortlist including Sally Rooney’s Conversations With Friends and Gabriel Tallent’s My Absolute Darling. Kumukanda is a Luvale language word connoting initiation, referencing both the rites of passage which boys from the Lovale people of Zambia and Angola go through to become a man, as well as initiation rites for young Londoners. Chair of judges Dai Smith praised Chingonyi’s “original and distinctive voice”, calling Kumukanda “mature and moving”.“Unlike many other books by immigrant writers discussing memories of the homeland and the sensations of a new country, Kayo’s volume is not a lamentation for what he imagines has been lost, but it’s a new kind of celebration, albeit a vexed one, of the joys of living in a new country,” said professor and judge Kurt Heinzelman. “For me, the particular pleasure of this volume is that the particulars of his experience are so emotionally various and culturally erse, and that the whole collection is even more beautiful than the sum of its parts.”Chingonyi, who was born in Zambia and moved to the UK aged six, writes in the poem Self-Portrait as a Garage Emcee of how, “In time, I could rattle off The Slim Shady LP line for line  though no amount of practice could conjure the pale skin  and blue eyes that made Marshall a poet and me  just another brother who could rhyme”. In Casting, he writes: “Three years RADA, two years rep and I’m sick  of playing lean dark men who may have guns.  I have a book of poems in my rucksack,  blank pad, two pens, tattered A-Z, headphones  that know Prokofiev as well as Prince Paul.”In his review for the , Ben Wilkinson called Kumukanda “an authentic and convincing book of poems in its many nuanced portrayals and unflinching reflections … As Valerie Mason-John once dryly observed: ‘Don’t categorise yourself as a black or ethnic poet. There’s no need to, the media will do that for you.’ Chingonyi goes one better, using his lyric panache to honour pop references and cultural experiences of personal and communal significance while also turning the tables, casting a wry and intelligent eye on our wider attitudes.”Actor Michael Sheen, who presented the prize to Chingonyi at a ceremony in Swansea on Thursday night, called Kumukanda “a stunning and hugely culturally relevant collection of poems that keenly explore black culture, masculinity and identity in Britain today”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dd98a09c031a033ab5b89e0986ad0da1e4e9bf2/0_131_5315_3188/master/5315.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74bcf32604ca08a8df0146a515336e0f","title":"cocky why romance fiction has gone weak at the knees for a double entendre","story":"Cocky Cowboy author Faleena Hopkins has trademarked the word ‘cocky’. What romantic potential could she possibly see?The world of romance fiction was flushed this week as it turned out that the word “cocky” had been trademarked. Faleena Hopkins, whose oeuvre includes Cocky Cowboy, Cocky Biker, and Cocky Soldier, wrote to rivals demanding that they retitle their own novels containing the word “cocky”. The genre guild, Romance Writers of America, is consulting its lawyers. Meanwhile, is such use of “cocky” just a silly double entendre?A cock, of course, is a male hen, as well as a night watchman, part of a gun, the gnomon of a sundial, or “a spout or short pipe serving as a channel for passing liquids through”, according to the OED, which gently suggests that last sense as giving rise to the word’s common use for the male member. “Oh man what art thou? when thy cock is up?” asks a character in Nathan Field’s 1618 comedy Amends for Ladies.But the adjective “cocky” had already been first used to mean “lecherous” 69 years previously it only began to mean vain or conceited (strutting like a cock) in the late 18th century. “Cocky”, then, does originally have sexual implications, and so is a perfectly respectable description of Hopkins’s cast of cock-toting Casanovas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3588c8273c034b97e235f4232974428307b44cf2/0_262_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab15e9b5abf4656f1c0db7e8d52ccffa","title":"how britain really works stig abell review","story":"People don’t know nearly as much as they think they do. Often, we don’t even know what we don’t even know. Many people are sure they understand parliamentary process, how a customs union works, or what goes on in schools, but when put on the spot find such things curiously hard to explain. What happens at a bill’s second reading? When would a person sit their Sats? These sound like pub quiz questions, but are surprisingly helpful in putting news in its proper context or\u0026nbspsimply understanding how the country ticks.To say that How Britain Really Works fills in some of these gaps runs the risk of making it sound dull when it’s a wry, readable, even whimsical book. (Sometimes a bit too whimsical the conceit of using the footnotes to add funny human stories rather than reference facts wears pretty thin.) Stig Abell’s aim was to come up with a modern, adult version of those children’s encyclopedias a pre-Google generation grew up dipping in and out of, a sort of Schott’s Miscellany of Britain. But while there’s an endearingly old-fashioned air to the idea of a book containing actual facts, rather than grand provocative theories about Britishness, it takes on an interestingly new light in an era of fake news.The combination of people who don’t know what they don’t know – and so may be dangerously overconfident about their ability to tell truth from fiction in the context of the type of political mendacity seen\u0026nbspduring the referendum campaign – along with a\u0026nbsptorrent of highly plausible, maliciously misleading information on social media, has not been a happy one. This book pulls off the difficult trick of being a\u0026nbsppotted primer to deeper issues behind the news – from economics and politics via health policy to how the media works – without being patronising or assuming too much knowledge.It doesn’t dig deep on any topic, dispatching two centuries of British political history in not much more than half a chapter, and current affairs junkies won’t find much in it that they genuinely didn’t know (or perhaps more accurately, didn’t think they knew). And\u0026nbspsince it’s written from the carefully even-handed viewpoint of a classic centrist dad, it’s not one for the radical in your life, either.But what is there is cleverly chosen and nicely put together, and it’s rather soothing to read something that isn’t angrily trying to sell you a big idea and then cherrypicking its facts to suit the polemic. If Abell has\u0026nbspa grand theory of Britishness, it would be that it’s\u0026nbspall a\u0026nbspbit of an agreeable muddle a series of polite fictions and happy or unhappy accidents that produce something that defies easy labelling. Oddly enough, it is a pretty good description in some ways of Abell himself, whose journalistic career s high\u0026nbspand lowbrow and has taken him from gamekeeper to poacher (he went from running the Press Complaints Commission to working as managing editor of the Sun, which brought him in after the phone-hacking scandal as it tried to show it was cleaning up its act, before becoming editor of the Times Literary Supplement).The sharpest chapter is perhaps the one on education. After a pithy analysis of how schools in the UK compare with those in the countries the UK is always lambasted for lagging behind – mainly the exam factories of Korea, Singapore and Japan – and of\u0026nbspcurrent challenges for education, Abell reaches his own uncompromising prescription: whack VAT on private schools, scrap grammars, abolish GCSEs in favour of one final exam at 18 and bring back maintenance grants for poorer university students.Elsewhere, he is rather more tentative. Abell had a ringside seat on the Leveson inquiry, having testified before it while at the PCC, and the chapter on the media is fascinating and more emotional than the rest of the book. He was clearly going through something of a dark night of the soul at this point during the inquiry he describes himself as “coming apart at\u0026nbspthe seams: working, going home to two young children, punching holes in\u0026nbspdoors with mute frustration” – so much so that his wife booked him an appointment with a psychiatrist, which he missed. But many readers will feel he still doesn’t address the perceived cosiness of the relationship\u0026nbspbetween press and regulator, or the woeful inability of the media to police itself.This slightly evasive quality is apparent elsewhere, particularly in the chapter endings which, with a few exceptions, elegantly avoid drawing much in the way\u0026nbspof conclusions.Yet the book remains a smart execution of an idea that is more important than it sounds – in a world convulsed by polarising ideologies and white-hot feelings, there is a lot to be said for writing that is cool and fact-based and, indeed, for having a rough idea of what you’re talking about.

As a consequence, a feasible technical solution has been identified. “Volkswagen is now waiting for the concerned authorities’ final validation in order to implement it, both on the customers’ cars and on the future series production.”The issue emerged just a day BMW recalled more than 300,000 cars in the UK because of an electrical fault that has caused some vehicles to cut out which was revealed by a BBC Watchdog Live investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d55a5dc78e08a7b6b44550608ec063fe4f531114/22_78_1848_1109/master/1848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3470b9228d5e6aa38779dc8bf6469621","title":"no ticket to ride japanese bus drivers strike by giving free rides okayama","story":"A protest in the city of Okayama is the latest in a long line of fare-free travel in response to privatisation and price hikesInstead of forming a picket line, protesting bus drivers in the Japanese city of Okayama have been completing their routes – but not taking fares from passengers.It’s not the first time transit workers have taken this kind of action. Last year in Sydney, bus drivers from 12 depots conducted a “fare-free day”, turning off card machines as part of a dispute over government plans to privatise services.Brisbane bus drivers tried a similar tactic last July, leading fare-free days as part of action calling for increased wages, improved safety on buses and better rosters.But it’s far more common to have passengers pushing for free rides. The most prominent protests have come from Brazil’s Movimento Passe Livre (Free Fare Movement), which argues that paid-for public transport creates social exclusion.Starting in 2003 in the city of Salvador, when thousands of Brazilian students and workers closed roads to protest against rising transport fares, the movement climaxed in nationwide protests in 2013. The targets of the demonstrations broadened from transport fees to corruption and poor public services in general – and as many as a million people took to the streets.On a much smaller scale, a group in Sweden has been advocating for free transit across cities for almost two decades. Formed in 2001, Planka encourages people to dodge fares, helping members pay any penalty fees through a group fund.They share videos offering guidance to citizens in Stockholm and Gothenburg on how to jump barriers and keep watch for ticket inspectors. “Mobility and class are tightly linked,” the group writes in its book The Traffic Power Structure. “A society based on the current mobility paradigm … contributes directly to the increase of economic and social injustice.”And in New York, a group of activists reacted to a hike in subway fares in 2013 by using unlimited passes to swipe in other commuters.Back in Okayama, working while on strike might seem strange – but it appears the bus drivers have got the public on their side.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333257b4c6ed496dc2d34aed6deae03f7500d7ea/0_392_4065_2439/master/4065.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b0c82628e658b8de69035a645b85e0","title":"striking lawyers legal underfunding","story":"There is a strike under way that you’ve probably barely heard about, although its implications are as grave as any that make the headlines. This one doesn’t involve train drivers, enraging as those stoppages are for stranded commuters. It doesn’t involve university lecturers, erting as those have been for students, or even junior doctors. It involves criminal barristers from 100 chambers who, in protest against government reforms of legal aid fees, are refusing to take on new publicly funded cases – or in other words, defences of people who can’t afford their own lawyers.The courts haven’t ground to a halt, so defendants are still ending up in the dock. It’s just that more of them are now attempting to represent themselves, often with only the vaguest idea of what they’re doing, on charges ranging all the way up to murder. The risk of miscarriages of justice is screamingly obvious, especially when it comes to disclosure of evidence – how are complete amateurs to know what useful material the prosecution could be hanging on to? – but defendants are not the only potential victims here. If it’s hard enough for witnesses to relive distressing experiences with the accused glowering silently at them from the dock, then imagine what it’s like when he or she’s the one conducting the cross-examination.The Law Society Gazette recently highlighted a troubling family court case in Middlesbrough involving a father accused of raping his ex-wife and assaulting her son from a previous relationship neither parent was granted legal aid but neither could afford their own lawyer, so the judge ended up attempting to cross-examine them himself while court officials compiled makeshift bundles of evidence. When the distressed mother said she simply couldn’t face going through it all again, the judge ended up finding most of her allegations unproven while noting in his judgment: “I am in little doubt that had one or both of these parents been represented, the fact-finding process and probably the outcome would have been very different.” And on these impossibly shifting sands now rests a decision about whether the father should see their daughter. Yet all this has barely registered in the public consciousness, even though things are only likely to get worse later this month, when barristers are being urged to up the ante by instigating a policy of “no returns” (refusing to take on cases that another barrister has had to drop due to an unexpected diary clash).The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, led a debate on criminal legal aid in parliament this week, and stories are bubbling up from courtrooms via social media, too: the South Wales Evening Post’s crime reporter, Jason Evans, tweeted earlier this week that in the space of just one morning in court he’d seen unrepresented defendants appear on charges ranging from fraud to GBH with intent and murder. But not many local papers have enough staff now to cover courts day in and day out. And, to be blunt, it’s likely too few readers care.Defendants are infinitely less sympathetic victims than maddened commuters, and lawyers aren’t like junior doctors, whose action over weekend working drew widespread support from patients. Barristers tend not to have legions of grateful customers, proud to go public about that time they got off by the skin of their teeth, and the widespread presumption is that lawyers don’t deserve pity that they all earn a fortune anyway, that legal aid is just a gravy train and anyway it’s too often awarded to the undeserving.Yet even if that were true over a decade ago, when the Labour government first launched a crackdown on legal aid with tabloid-friendly stories about bumper payouts to fatcat QCs, it isn’t so true now. The government’s reforms to legal aid fees are meant to shift more money down to junior barristers, widely seen as struggling. (Those just starting out in criminal work can earn as little as £12,000 per year, less than the minimum wage, to which they’re not entitled because they’re deemed self-employed the Tory MP Bob Stewart admitted during this week’s debate that of the five junior barristers who had contacted him about the strike, none were earning enough even to start repaying their student debt.) But those reforms do so in some cases by taking money from those not all that far above them. There is an emerging consensus that however imaginatively it’s distributed, there simply isn’t enough money to go around, given the Ministry of Justice has taken some of the deepest budget cuts in government. Even the former Conservative justice minister Jonathan Djanogly, who defended the government’s new fee arrangement this week from the backbenches, admitted to “some sympathy with those who complain that the criminal justice system is creaking at the seams” even if his solutions would be radically different from Burgon’s.Meanwhile the fear is all this will hurt initiatives to get more working-class children to go into the law even if their long-term earning prospects are good, it’s tough for barristers just starting out in expensive cities such as London to survive if they can’t be bailed out by their parents, when the fee for a short court appearance can be less than the train fare to reach it.Something, in short, has gone very wrong. But it’s gone wrong in a part of the public sector that, unlike schools or hospitals, we don’t normally regard as public, that doesn’t tug at the heartstrings, that for most of us remains completely invisible – all of which encourages ministers to think they can ride this one out. Few strikes are solved by giving one side everything it wants.

Labour was quick to accuse the government of “pursuing its own vanity projects” at the expense of comprehensive schools. “Just weeks after abandoning their own guarantee to protect every school from cash cuts, the Tories have excluded the vast majority of schools from any extra funding,” said Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary. “The continued obsession with grammar schools will do nothing for the vast majority of children. It is absurd for ministers to push ahead with plans to expand them when the evidence is clear they do nothing to improve social mobility.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, likened the government’s efforts to a zombie movie.“The grammar school corpse has climbed out of its coffin once again, despite evidence of the damage that selective education causes,” Courtney said.“Schools up and down the country are desperately short of funds. This is money that would be better invested in ensuring all schools could provide for the basic needs of their pupils without having to ask for money from parents.”The DfE said the £50m selective schools expansion fund would be open to existing grammar schools that offer to expand their admissions, countering criticism that selection benefits children from middle class families who can afford coaching for entrance exams.A DfE spokesperson said around 150 grammar schools had already pledged to do more outreach with local primary schools.Jim Skinner, the Grammar School Heads’ Association chief executive, said: “We are very pleased that, like other good and outstanding schools, selective schools now have access to a fund to allow them to expand their premises.“This is particularly important at a time when there are increasing numbers of pupils reaching secondary age and such high demand from parents for selective school places.”The policy was given a qualified vote of approval by Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust that works on improving social mobility through education.Lampl said the government was right to insist that existing grammars do more to admit disadvantaged pupils. “Our research has shown how socially selective grammars are: you are 10 times more likely to go to one if you went to a prep school than if you are on free school meals,” Lampl said.But others criticised the plans as implausible at a time when state school budgets were under huge pressure.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are disappointed that the government has decided to spend scarce funding on expanding grammar schools.“While there are many good selective schools, just as there are many good non-selective schools, the evidence is clear that expanding the number of selective places is likely to be damaging to social mobility.”The expansion of new grammar schools was part of a raft of announcements by Hinds, including a decision to allow new voluntary-aided faith schools to admit pupils entirely on the basis of religious criteria, and an effort to resuscitate the free school movement with a new round of applications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ebff09269888bec1e21dd2d1fd67a159bbe4ad/0_267_5229_3137/master/5229.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX2RlZmF1bHQucG5n\u0026amp;s=c4c4cd10cbdd76517ae52718cd5f94d7","title":"theyre out to get you study finds cyclists face paranoia about drivers","story":"As a cyclist in a busy urban environment, it can seem that some drivers are out to get you. And now a new study has concluded that for many bike riders, this is only too true: a sense of paranoia is a clinical reality.The research led by Lyn Ellet, a clinical psychology academic at Royal Holloway, University of London, studied 323 cyclists in London aged between 18-66, and used a series of questions to gauge their levels of paranoia when on a bike. In contrast, the study discovered, when measured for trait paranoia – how paranoid people are in general – the cyclists tended to show relatively low levels, and there was no apparent link between riders’ state and trait levels of paranoia.So, what is to blame for such strong feelings, summed up by one participant who is quoted in the study as saying: “I honestly view every driver as if he’s trying to kill me”?It’s seemingly down to the generally feral road conditions faced by cyclists in London (and, you could add, in most other places in the UK, not to mention other countries). The study puts it thus:The present research indicates that paranoia towards motor vehicle users may be common when cycling in London, and that far from being a pathological response, observed state paranoia is an understandable response to an urban environment containing significant and very real threat. The present findings reinforce and add a further dimension to the pressing public health need to focus on and protect urban cyclists. Highlighting this point, the study also looked into reported paranoia among travellers on London’s tube system, another transport method which has its negatives, though very rarely connected to a real personal threat to one’s safety.Here, the study said, state paranoia levels were notably lower, and there was a more general correlation between how paranoid people felt on the tube and their more general levels of paranoia.I fully understand these sentiments, though I perhaps feel a bit differently. I don’t generally think drivers are deliberately out to harm, harass or upset me – with the important caveat that this does very occasionally happen.Instead, what terrifies me is the lack of care, the casual approach to taking risks against a desperately vulnerable human on a bike by someone safely encased in a tonne of protective steel. This casual approach to others’ peril was eloquently expressed in the early 1950s by Alan Lennox-Boyd, at the time the transport minister in Winston Churchill’s government. He said: Accidents in the main arise from the taking of very small risks a very large number of times. A thousand-to-one chance against an accident may not be rated very high, but for every thousand people that take it there will be an accident.(As an aside it’s worth noting that several decades later, aged 78, Lennox-Boyd was killed by a car when trying to cross Fulham Road on foot. It’s not clear if the driver was taking one of those thousand-to-one chances, for example by speeding.)The vital point to stress is that pretty much everyone on the roads does take such risks, and often in several modes of transport. On foot you might nip across the road as a car approaches while checking your email on a bike you might slip through a narrow gap, or chance a light on amber in a car you could go too fast, or glance down when a phone message flashes.The one difference comes in terms of physics: it’s only in charge of a motor vehicle when we have a realistic chance of killing or maiming another human. It is not an equal interaction.And this is the key lesson, I’d argue, about the paranoia study: if anything is out to get you, it’s a road system still overly skewed towards the flow of motor traffic, rather than the safety of the most vulnerable road users. And that’s what needs to change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/920c65d83b7d8e2d95cb67969954d02fd55111c6/0_398_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f325c41109a9661fda811d4db1a30db","title":"craft werk meet the maestros of the fashion industry","story":"The worlds of fashion and craft have long been symbiotic, but there’s a new raft of influential designers bringing a new relevance to the relationshipIs craft the new black? Yes, if the line-up of participants of London Craft Week – which kicked off in the capital yesterday – is anything to go by. The five-day event features several influential fashion names including Loewe, Mulberry, Christian Louboutin, Le Kilt, Alice Archer, Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes and Delpozo. All are taking part in workshops, exhibitions and events that aim to make the link between craft and fashion a strong one.And why wouldn’t they? In the past five years, craft has become really cool in fashion. Chanel’s autumnwinter 2016 couture show was dedicated to the women who craft the collections, known as the “petit mains” brands which prioritise the local artisan – such as Hiut Jeans, which reinvigorated the town of Cardigan by setting up its business there – have been hailed as examples to follow. Meanwhile, fashion influencers are giving equal importance to timeless objects – such as glassware and ceramics – as they are the latest fashion trend. The creative director Alex Eagle, for example, sells hand-embroidered shoes alongside hand-thrown tableware by ceramicist Nicola Easton, while Laura Jackson’s forthcoming collection for Habitat in June features what she calls “a Wes Anderson jug – it’s massive and half red, half pink!”Collectively, it has been firmly put on the fashion industry’s agenda – and no brand has done more to plug the gap in the mainstream conscious than Loewe, the go-to luxury fashion label for purposeful pieces that have an artistic twist. Its annual Craft prize, which was set up by its creative director Jonathan Anderson in 2013, celebrates and supports international artisans who “demonstrate an exceptional ability to create objects of superior aesthetic value” in disciplines including ceramics, bookbinding, jewellery, leather, textiles, metal and wood. It awards €50,000 (£44,100) to the winner.At Mulberry, which is hosting demonstrations of how its leather goods are handmade in its London flagship, an apprenticeship programme was established in 2006 to preserve the skill set that is at risk of being lost from such spending cuts.If honouring craft is crucial to maintaining a fashion workforce, its current renaissance can also be attributed to the current rhetoric surrounding sustainability, says Samantha Roach, founder and designer at London fashion week favourite Le Kilt.“Young people in particular seem much more interested in the provenance of their clothing. They want to understand how their clothes are made and who has made them,” she says. Traditional craftsmanship is at the heart of Roach’s brand, which is running workshops over LCW in collaboration with the textile design consultancy Norn, to help educate attendees on artisanal craft techniques. It also has a current exhibition, Innovation Through Tradition, at the Michael Hoppen Gallery.“We want our customers to understand the value in an item of clothing that has its own personal story through repair, provenance and DIY touches,” says Roach. “For example, we have unravelled discarded tartan fabrics and used the yarns to weave into patches, therefore ensuring nothing goes to waste. Subculture has always been an important reference point, and we see craft as a form of anti-consumerism – it’s our own statement against disposable fashion. By educating people on the impact that clothing production has on the environment, we hope it will encourage people to invest their garments.”Craft does not, however, equate only to something handmade in the fashion landscape. It can incorporate specialist digital processes too, says the fashion designer Alice Archer, whose brand is famous for its intricate embroidery. “When I was a student, I learned how to hand-embroider and I worked for years as a hand-embroiderer, practising the skill. Now in my collections, I use digital embroidery like it is hand embroidery. I programme every single stitch on my computer, as if I am embroidering it by hand. This gives the embroideries some irregularities and a more emotional and human feeling, while making them infinitely reproducible.”Archer, who has pieces from her archive on display in the windows of The Place on Brook Street, during LCW also notes the “strong desire for modern takes on craft techniques such as embroidery, smocking, hand painted and printed pieces, and historic detailing” in the luxury fashion industry at the moment. “Clients seek unique products and experiences and want clothing to feel personal – I think ... people will invest more money in special pieces that are more timeless and classic and involve special craft processes.”See the full London Craft Week schedule here.

(Patty Jenkins was hired, then fired, from Thor 2: The Dark World in 2011, before breaking box-office records with last summer’s Wonder Woman.) In the DC universe, Ava DuVernay is directing the fantastical heaven-versus-hell epic The New Gods, and Cathy Yan is doing the same for Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn girl-gang spin-off Birds of Prey, written by Christina Hodson, who is also scripting Batgirl.Elsewhere in the galaxy, SJ Clarkson is helming the next Star Trek, while here on Earth screenwriters Kira Snyder, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Amanda Silver have been rejuvenating established properties such as Pacific Rim, Planet of the Apes, Tomb Raider, Jurassic World and Transformers.“When I was starting out as a screenwriter, the people I met with often made me feel like a unicorn: ‘A woman who loves to write sci-fi and action? How unusual!’” says Snyder, who co-wrote Pacific Rim: Uprising and is a writer and supervising producer on The Handmaid’s Tale. “But the fact was – and is – that this isn’t unusual.”The women were there the jobs weren’t. So what’s behind the industry’s rapid change?The historical hurdle has been Hollywood’s refusal to let these geek-loving women prove their worth – in the office and in cinemas. Studios credited male audiences for the success of male-directed hits, assuming that the women in the cinema had simply been dragged in by their dates. With their opinions calcified, producers wouldn’t even give female film-makers – and female films – a shot.Rachel Talalay became the first woman to direct a comic-book flick with 1995’s Tank Girl, a cult hit that fell short of mainstream success. Hollywood didn’t green-light another girl-powered property for a decade, and the stinging back-to-back flops of Catwoman and Elektra in 2004 and 2005, both directed by men, closed the door for another 12 years, until Wonder Woman. “I felt like I was gonna make this female action picture and we were going to kick through the glass ceiling and that was going to be that,” says Talalay. “We all know how naive I was.”In its earlier days, Comic-Con – the Las Vegas extravaganza of all things mainstream geek – entrenched the image that genre was guys-only. When Talalay brought Tank Girl to the convention, “the only other women there were booth babes”. Lori Petty’s snarling, fabulously nasty heroine encouraged more women to take up space – “the beginning of some female fandom actually coming out”.Look around Comic-Con today and it’s clear fandom equalised long before Hollywood caught on. “The nerds have taken over in such a positive way,” says Talalay. “Social media has had an effect – social media shaming does make some difference.” Online, they have championed the hiring of female directors, which has also pressured TV shows to hire more women. Talalay was the first woman to direct an episode of Supernatural, and only the second to tackle Doctor Who.Talalay survived what she calls “the dark ages” of the 2000s, post-Catwoman. “There was a whole vocabulary of ‘We don’t like working with women directors’,” she recalls. “‘Our show isn’t for you,’ ‘We had a woman director and she didn’t work out’ – it was just completely accepted like smoking on aeroplanes.”Talalay did what her advisors recommended – “Put your head down and keep working” – while fuelled by Tank Girl’s motto: “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” Eventually, the discrimination became so obvious that a handful of female directors contacted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which alerted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which then launched a years-long investigation into Hollywood hiring practices that culminated in a legal letter sent to every studio informing them that they had to correct their employment violations or face a lawsuit. “Then things started to change,” Talalay says.Suddenly, lots of things have changed. The ACLU and EEOC camps aren’t directly tied to #MeToo or #Time’sUp, but together, these movements have united the women of Hollywood. “Crucially, women are talking to each other more than ever,” says Snyder. “Social media and in-person meet-ups have been a great way to come together to share resources and recommendations and connect mentors and mentees.”From actors to directors, many of the women had spent their careers feeling isolated by the pressure of competing for a single female spot: the one tag-along girl in the all-guy action flick, the one female film-maker entrusted with the rare high-profile gig – who can’t screw it up for everyone else. In the tradition of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in Feud, women were encouraged to tear down each other, not the system.“We’ve heard Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock say on the red carpet that for so long they tried to keep us separate: that you can’t have two major actresses on a movie – you know those as, they’ll fight,” says Vanity Fair writer Joanna Robinson. This week, Kidman has vowed to work with at least one female director every 18 months and the Twitter feeds of everyone from Ava DuVernay to Zoe Saldana are a continuous celebration of other women in the industry, whether they have won an award, signed on to a new project, or simply had a birthday.“I’m in conversation all the time with other female film-makers about the future and what it all means,” says Angela Robinson. “Everybody’s head is exploding – careening from euphoria over the possibility of systemic change, to deep despair and cynicism about the nature of the machine.”Consider this burgeoning bond an unofficial union, forging ties across the screen actors, directors and writers’ guilds. Like when Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie insisted she wouldn’t participate in a stand-alone Harley Quinn film until the studio hired a female director. “We all need to be making conscious efforts to even out those statistics,” she declared. Five years ago, she might have been cautioned to simply be grateful for the lead in her own comic-book blockbuster. But in the current climate, Robbie felt confident raising her voice.As for the online trolls who rail against girl cooties in their popcorn flicks, most recently at the heroines at the centre of Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, there is a growing awareness that their opinions don’t matter. At least one studio has calculated that geek reactionaries comprise such an insignificant sliver of the potential box office that it can ignore their demands to go back to the early Comic-Con days of submissive babes in bikinis. “They’re small but loud, and they’re disproportionately blown out of proportion,” says Robinson. The real fight is changing the studio’s ingrained idea that girls will go to “boy” movies, but boys won’t go to “girl” movies – a trope Walt Disney himself dismissed back in 1959 when he wrote that female audiences “are the ones who drag the men in. If the women like it, to heck with the men.”Robinson is particularly cheered by Clarkson’s appointment. “Star Trek is really exciting because it’s not like: ‘Oh, this is the one with a female captain of the Starship Enterprise, so we want a woman to direct it.’ No. It’s nice to have a female perspective on a female superhero film, but in my utopian future, a woman can direct whatever, a man can direct whatever. LBGT, any race, your perspective on a different person’s experiences is also valuable.”That’s a point every woman echoes: true equality will come when the gender reveal of the latest Marvel director is as casual as a coin flip, not the high-pressure attention of Jenkins’ Wonder Woman – the first female-directed superhero film in 22 years starring the most legendary comic-book heroine – having to hit a home run for Team Female.“Many times it upset me in the past when people were saying: ‘Oh, so they brought a woman director because it’s a Wonder Woman movie,” star Gal Gadot told me last autumn. “And I always say: ‘No, Patty was the right person for this job because she knew exactly what she wanted to get and how to get it.”“Wonder Woman had to be amazing, it had to be the best DC movie – and I think it was,” says Variety’s Jenelle Riley. Its critical and financial success shattered the fossilised idea that female-driven blockbusters were jinxed. “I think going forward, it’s going to be hard to at least not consider women and people of colour,” says Riley. “We have 18 movies in the Marvel universe. If they didn’t start to expand their director pool, it would look a little funny.” Even if one female-headed flick stumbles, there are enough in the pipeline that Hollywood will continue marching forward.“I do think there is a slight lifting of the veil,” says Angela Robinson. “I feel like a lot of executives and gate-keepers are looking around, like out of a haze, and saying: ‘Wow, there’s a lot of people out there who want different kinds of stories.’ There is an unprecedented opportunity right now to create a whole new generation of characters and stories that speak to under-represented voices.”And speak for over-represented voices, too. “Looking ahead, I hope to see more women spearheading big franchises that don’t necessarily star women,” says Snyder. “There’s still much work to be done in achieving parity in stories and roles created for women, of course, and I love that women are being sought to write and direct these projects, but we’re writers and directors. We can write and direct male characters. Hell, men have been doing that on women’s stories since Sophocles.” It has been more than 2,400 years since the Greek tragedian wrote his version of Electra. Time for today’s generation of female storytellers to take their bow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8891888a813b92e23fa977c7a82212f66bda8c46/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9dd17749c7c0c048ed07e01c56eb678","title":"palme dor winners ranked cannes film festival","story":"As the Cannes film festival celebrates its 70th anniversary, here are the 10 best winners – from Viridiana and La Dolce Vita to Taxi Driver and Pulp FictionUncle Boonmee is a sublime film, a realist fantasy that plays with the ideas of the spiritual and the supernatural – but does so in such a remarkably calm and matter-of-fact way that it almost persuades you that these things are natural phenomena. Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s film is about a dying man who has retreated to the forests of north-eastern Thailand to make his peace with the world, and it offers its visions and conceits in such a calming and quiet spirit that it is impossible to refuse them.Jane Campion’s exotic and very literary movie, set in the early years of the European colonisation of New Zealand, has Holly Hunter as the mute Ada whose cruel husband (Sam Neill) will not let her have her prized piano. Another man (Harvey Keitel) rescues her, via an arrangement whereby she can have the piano back in exchange for increasingly sexualised “lessons”. The piano is fetishised, eroticised: all Ada’s yearning and frustration is poured into it. A perennially fascinating and subtle film.This Palme d’Or that set the seal on Quentin Tarantino’s huge prestige – and initiated the gruesomely abusive career of its producer, Harvey Weinstein. But this film’s electrifying energy shook Cannes out of what many felt was a rather complacent arthouse torpor. Its insolent ability to shock, amuse and produce endless uniquely exciting and seductive dialogue riffs co-exist with a brilliant experimentation with fractured narrative. The excitement of seeing it for the first time was incredible.This was the film that Luis Buñuel made on being invited back to Spain from his Mexican exile by the Franco regime and it instantly offended some of the most reactionary and pompous elements of the Spanish political establishment. Fernando Rey plays a man who has conceived an erotic obsession with his niece Viridiana (Silvia Pinal), who is about to take her final vows as a nun. He attempts to drug her, but rape is beyond him and he hangs himself in guilt the shocked and bewildered Viridiana invites some homeless people to live in his house and the situation deteriorates into an anti-carnival of licentiousness and abuse. An eerie spectacle of subversion.The icy Austrian master Michael Haneke has won the Palme d’Or twice – the second time was for Amour, his heart-rending study of an old couple facing illness and death. But my mind returns over and over to this deeply disturbing parable of Germany in the years before the first world war: another study of group dysfunction and poisoned-herd malaise. A village is plagued with strange, malicious acts of violence and spite, and at the community’s social apex is the pastor, superbly played by Burghart Klaussner, who is a strict disciplinarian, making his errant children wear a white ribbon of contrition on their arm: the ribbon looks weirdly both like a Nazi armband and a yellow star.Federico Fellini’s brilliant, hallucinatory movie invented the word “paparazzo”, and perhaps also invented modern Italy itself – at least the Italy that the rest of the world loved to idealise. Marcello Mastroianni is a jaded, melancholy gossip columnist who hangs around with Rome’s smart set – too good for this job, too lazy to write his novel. Fellini himself loved circuses, and this was the media circus, the showbiz circus and perhaps just the circus of all worldly vanity.This is a beautiful film that induces a kind of ecstasy of sadness. Nanni Moretti took his work to the next level: he directed and starred as the therapist who is beginning to have doubts about his vocation. Out of a sense of duty, he makes a house call to a demanding patient, which means he has to cancel a hiking trip with his son, who goes boating instead and is killed in an accident. Moretti shows the effect that this unthinkable tragedy has on the entire family.The horror and the weird, despairing exhilaration of Martin Scorsese’s 1976 classic still have the power to knock you backwards out of your cinema seat. The N-bombs, the misogyny, the fear and despair are brutal. Livewire young Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a traumatised Vietnam vet who, like Macbeth, has lost the ability to sleep and is now condemned to an eternal night-time of wakefulness, cruising around the infernal city in his yellow cab, encountering lost and vengeful souls. He finally grows obsessed with rescuing a child prostitute – an unforgettable performance from Jodie Foster – and thus redeeming himself. The daytime scenes in the political office are also superb, with a great and under-noticed performance from Albert Brooks.This is arguably the masterpiece of one of cinema’s great poets, Abbas Kiarostami – a strange, beautiful, bizarre, heart-rending parable that even now eludes precise interpretation. A deeply depressed man intends to kill himself and then lie in the grave that a labourer has dug, and must then fill in. It is startling, preposterous – and shocking and upsetting. It speaks to the darkest and least discussed aspect of this subject: the wish that the suicidal act itself can be covered up. But someone tries to talk him out of it – by reminding him of the sweetness and joys of this life, like a cherry’s taste.The classic metaphysical noir was written by Graham Greene, directed by Carol Reed and starred Orson Welles as the enigmatic fugitive Harry Lime, a crooked dealer in stolen penicillin in postwar Vienna having faked his death, he has gone to ground. Unemployed pulp-thriller writer Holly Martins, played by Joseph Cotten, must unravel the mystery of why exactly his old pal Lime has lured him to Vienna with the offer of a job. The Cannes jury, under the presidency of historian, mandarin and festival co-founder George Huisman, chose The Third Man over competitors such as David Lean’s Passionate Friends and Thorold Dickinson’s The Queen of Spades. It was the right choice – and the film resonates more and more over the years. Is Lime now in purgatory? Or hell? Or might the strangely insolent and unrepentant Lime be the instrument of grace for everyone else: those flawed, shabby, desperate people who have somehow survived the war? Lime could be a martyred Judas Iscariot, someone who has absorbed everyone else’s sins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3bbfd10a66e9657a7fff71926a3c27c1c5a49f1/226_0_2901_1740/master/2901.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90eade2646866164aaed27d453b16a47","title":"west ham manchester united premier league match report","story":"Manchester United must know that it is a possibility that they will spend another season in the shadow of their formidable neighbours. The most famous club in England are 19 points behind Manchester City with one game remaining and while this forgettable draw secured second place for José Mourinho’s spluttering team, that will not be cause for celebration when they consider the ease with which Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking champions have cantered into the distance.The gap is vast and United will struggle to cut it as long as they continue to toil against opponents as limited as West Ham. Mourinho argued that a point was a respectable reward but United’s fans, who spent much of the second half bellowing their support for the hospitalised Sir Alex Ferguson on a drab night at the London Stadium, must be concerned at their team’s negative approach.Forget about the late flare-up between Paul Pogba and Mark Noble. That was a sideshow. The real intrigue was that when Mourinho turned to his bench as this dire game neared its conclusion, he did not consider the merits of Anthony Martial. Instead he opted for caution, turning to Eric Bailly and Ashley Young to see United over the line, and Martial stayed in his seat, yawning along with the rest of us.“When the game goes to minute 70 or 75, you don’t win, you don’t lose,” Mourinho said. “We deserved the point and second position. When you are not ready to be champion, second position is the best available.”It might seem harsh to be critical given that United got the job done, assuming that their task was to participate in a grim slog. Yet it is hard to shake off the impression that Mourinho is managing expectations in an effort to make it seem that he cannot be blamed for his team’s failure to compete with City.He had glowered more than usual before this game and his observation that some of the players at his disposal are not good enough to challenge Guardiola’s side did not seem like a classic motivational ploy.United, who made eight changes after their defeat at Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion last Friday, rarely suggested that they were going to respond to their manager’s curious form of tough love. They needed time to adjust to an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2 system and although they looked solid in the central areas, it must have alarmed Mourinho when Chris Smalling’s failure to deal with Aaron Cresswell’s cross almost allowed Marko Arnautovic to give West Ham an early lead.Arnautovic turned an awkward header over, however, and United started to threaten sporadically. Pogba had the freedom to roam behind Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, and Mourinho’s side could argue that they were unfortunate not to be in front at the interval. Scott McTominay sent a shot inches wide after an error from Manuel Lanzini, Lingard had two swerving shots pushed away by Adrián, and West Ham were indebted to a brilliant piece of athleticism from their goalkeeper in the 23rd minute.Sánchez, who scored a hat-trick for Arsenal on this ground last season, must have been licking his lips when Antonio Valencia found him with a cut-back from the right. He had time to pick his spot and he tried to bend a shot high to Adrián’s right. The Spaniard responded with a sharp stop, however, and then he sprang back into position to turn Luke Shaw’s fizzing low drive against the woodwork.It is two years to the day since West Ham said farewell to Upton Park with an emotional victory over United and with his team’s Premier League status secured, there was an argument that this was an opportunity for David Moyes to let go of the handbrake.Yet West Ham’s pragmatic display had a sapping effect on the atmosphere and did little to further the Scot’s case that he deserves a contract extension at the end of the season. “I thought the players showed a great attitude,” Moyes said. “Sometimes when you get safe you can slip away with it but they were at it the whole night. It was a thoroughly deserved point.”At least Arnautovic gave it a go. The Austrian took on United’s back three on his own at times and he deserved better after a powerful surge down the right only for João Mário to jab the cross wide from close range.With Romelu Lukaku unavailable and Mourinho waiting until the 74th minute to bring on Marcus Rashford, United’s attacks lacked a potent presence. Sánchez was persistent and he almost took advantage of indecision from Adrián early in the second half, however. Yet West Ham were relieved that Angelo Ogbonna raced back to head the Chilean’s chip off the line. Declan Rice, another assured presence at the back, would also earn appreciative applause for a fine tackle on Sánchez.West Ham’s reluctance to throw caution to the wind was hard to justify, with Moyes waiting until the 66th minute to introduce Andy Carroll. Yet the temperature only rose when Pogba and Noble clashed. Both men were booked but Carroll could face punishment from the Football Association after appearing to lash out at Shaw. At least Noble and Pogba had cooled down sufficiently to share an embrace after the final whistle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f521e772d777bd40f228ae403ac850d97d12653/357_34_3896_2338/master/3896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8919926ddcc097f643e8e0d3e854541f","title":"david beckham appointed ambassador of british fashion","story":"British Fashion Council hopes to leverage Beckham’s fame to attract young talent and global investmentDavid Beckham is to take on a leadership role in the fashion industry, a move that consolidates the standing of Beckham and his wife, Victoria, who is a designer, as the first couple of British fashion.As newly appointed ambassadorial president, Beckham will on Friday visit educational fashion projects and clothing manufacturers in Manchester. The post, which Beckham described in a statement as “the chance to get under the skin of an industry I love”, will comprise two parts. The British Fashion Council hopes to leverage Beckham’s fame to attract a new generation of domestic creative and business talent into the industry by encouraging young people to view fashion as a potential career. Meanwhile at a global level, the draw of the Beckham name is expected to bring international investors to the table and secure financial backing for talented young designers.“I’m really excited about promoting fashion as an opportunity to all kids across the country, regardless of their background or their gender,” Beckham told the , adding: “That means creating more awareness for boys to get involved with fashion ... helping them understand that creative opportunities are available to them too.” Beckham appears to have form in encouraging young men to pursue careers in the industry: his eldest son, Brooklyn, is studying photography at the New York fashion school Parsons.Stephanie Phair, the newly appointed chair of the British Fashion Council, described Beckham’s role as that of a “global figurehead”. Beckham will host an event at menswear shows in London in June Trips to China and the US are in the pipeline. But he will take a backseat during September’s London Fashion Week in order to give Victoria, who is bringing her catwalk show home from New York to celebrate her 10th anniversary in fashion, her turn in the spotlight.The role is another step in a striking evolution from brashly dressed footballer to a front row regular who already has a place at fashion’s top table as the majority owner of the Savile Row label Kent \u0026amp Curwen. The British Fashion Council hopes that the power of the Beckham brand – which has proved hugely valuable to the designer names he has promoted and the magazines he has appeared in, and has spawned trends from tattoos to flat caps – will prove lucrative on the global stage for British fashion, an industry Beckham described on Thursday as “one of our best performing exports”. Beckham, keen to restore his public reputation after a furore last yea r around leaked emails in which he appeared to bemoan not having been given a knighthood, said he wanted “to support an industry that’s been so good to me”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a7994dec31de0f41b32584b300bbdffb0119a87/0_121_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f119c974134d12be88aa2fbadabc6c9c","title":"jose mourinho ajax justin kluivert manchester united anthony martial","story":"José Mourinho is targeting Ajax’s Justin Kluivert this summer, with the 19-year-old favouring a move to Manchester United.Kluivert, son of the former Barcelona and Netherlands centre-forward Patrick, has been in contract discussions with Ajax regarding a new deal.However it is understood that these have broken down because of Kluivert’s demand that he should become the highest-paid player at the club.Kluivert asked for a sizeable rise to €1.5m (£1.3m) a year and a proportion of any future transfer fee, to be split between him and his agent, Mino Raiola. Ajax’s policy is to pay no player more than €1m, so Kluivert demanded a significant signing-on fee to compensate.Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 league games this season – including a hat-trick in a 5-1 win over Roda in November – and believes he deserves fresh terms to reflect his growing status. He is on the wage of his initial professional contract, signed in 2016, which ends next summer. Kluivert made his international debut in March, as a replacement in the Netherlands’ 3-0 win over Portugal.Kluivert’s likes to play as a wide forward and can operate on either wing, though his preference is on the left. Mourinho was a coach at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Patrick Kluivert played for the club.Mourinho’s interest in Kluivert casts further doubt over the future of Anthony Martial. The 22-year-old also plays on the left but has been unable to hold down a starting berth under the Portuguese.

Thank goodness for that, because there might not be much to look forward to at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. The match between Swansea and Stoke is likely to be a wake, with both clubs wondering how the hell they got into this mess. A number of players will be making their last appearance for both sides, seeing no contradiction in the belief that they are far too good to play in the Championship. Swansea could still stay up, but they need snookers, a miracle and, most unlikely of all, at least one goal. RSSuddenly Southampton seem an attractive proposition again. Having all but avoided relegation, the club can begin looking up rather than down. There would have been an exodus of players had they dropped a ision but Saints, with Mark Hughes likely to remain, will be in a strong position again this summer. Some of the younger players, especially those such as Jack Stephens and Jan Bednarek, ought to come back hardened by the experience. There is no obvious candidate ready to jump ship, as in years gone by, with Ryan Bertrand the biggest-name exit imaginable, while it is difficult to see Sofiane Boufal or Guido Carrillo staying put in Hampshire much longer. It was always going to be a big summer either way, but with survival set to be confirmed at home against Manchester City on Sunday, the club must take stock and learn from their mistakes. BFAt 2pm on Sunday, somebody – maybe, just maybe, on Twitter – is going to be very angry at Jürgen Klopp. He can’t win with his selection for Liverpool’s last league match against Brighton. If he picks his best XI he will be jeopardising their fitness before the Champions League final against Real Madrid if he picks a weakened team he will be jeopardising Liverpool’s place in next season’s Champions League. There are so many things for Klopp to juggle: momentum, mood, match sharpness, avoiding injury to key players. Liverpool only need a point, and Klopp’s history suggests he will start a very strong side with a view to taking players off after an hour. But if one of the Fab Three twangs a hamstring, he may never hear the end of it. RSWith Champions League qualification out of Chelsea’s hands, Sunday’s trip to St James’ Park is ever likelier to be Antonio Conte’s last in charge of the 2017 champions. Of greater impact might be the question of whether it is also a swansong for his counterpart in the home dug-out. Although results have fallen away in recent weeks, Rafa Benítez has much to feel satisfied with a year after guiding Newcastle back up from the Championship: his side have survived comfortably after a rocky start, he has coaxed decisive performances from a number of players such as Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles and Mo Diamé and he remains an enormously popular figure on Tyneside. Yet as ever with Newcastle, off-field uncertainty around budgets and ownership threaten to hobble their progress, and are likely to determine whether Benítez remains at a club for whom a place in at least the top eight should be a realistic goal next season. The chance to sign off 2017-18 with a victory over historic adversaries Chelsea should be one Benítez will jump at. TDOn the face of it, the scene is set for one big royal knees-up in West Yorkshire, with Huddersfield set to toast safety and Arsène Wenger, after 22 years, bowing out of Arsenal. Wenger will be desperate to go out with a bang, particularly after a couple of raw reminders of their shortcomings under him recently, namely their Europa League exit to Atlético Madrid and defeat at Leicester on Wednesday evening. The biggest worry is that Huddersfield might wake up from their survival hangover with a bounce – after celebrating safety into the early hours of Thursday morning at a Fitzrovia nightclub. The best bit about their Premier League party was that, after opting to ditch the plane home – instead favouring the team coach so they could presumably continue festivities more easily – they were told that their coach driver was not permitted to clock up the mileage back from Stamford Bridge. David Wagner subsequently gave his players – who travelled back north on the train – two days off, but can they manage one final lasting surprise before the season’s out? BFThe biggest risk West Bromwich Albion could take this summer is to wriggle out of giving Darren Moore the full-time job. It was cruel, to say the least, that the 44-year-old picked up the manager of the month award on the same day his team were relegated from the Premier League, given he dragged the club up off the floor to the verge of whatwould have ranked one of the most extraordinary miracles of all time. He has galvanised a troubled group that had gone awry under Alan Pardew’s leadership and, if he was installed as caretaker manager sooner, it is not unfathomable to imagine a different outcome this season. The other names linked with the job – Dean Smith, Chris Wilder and even Lee Johnson – have all impressed in the Championship and, surely, Moore should at least be given a chance to do the same after bidding farewell to the Premier League at Crystal Palace. BFFor 12 years, Michael Carrick has been the best supporting actor of Old Trafford. He is the only survivor of the last great United team, which won three consecutive titles and a Champions League between 2006 and 2009. Carrick, who replaced Roy Keane by not replacing him at all, had a major impact with his defensive awareness, calmness and particularly the range and positivity of his passing. He had some lows after that - he was twice left to deal with Xavi and Andres Iniesta on his own in a Champions League final, and his mistakes against Bayern Munich in 2010 and Manchester City in 2011 were savagely punished – but recovered to become a senior player either side of Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement. The coaches who appreciated Carrick, like Ferguson and Martin Jol, really appreciated him. On Sunday, United fans will get to pay tribute before he disappears modestly onto the coaching staff. RSAll right-thinking neutrals should hope this Spurs team have another crack at winning something next season, but there is a nagging sense that Sunday’s game against Leicester might be the end of an era. In a sense, that’s obvious: Spurs will play at the new White Hart Lane next season, and the whiff of a new era will extend way beyond the Michelin-starred cooking that will be a feature of Spurs’ new gastrofooty experience. But the Coquilles St. Jacques Grillées et Minestrone de Palourdes won’t taste half as good if Spurs fans are watching a different team to the one that has charmed everyone in the past three seasons. Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose look certain to leave for, erm, starters. Though they would be missed, their departure would not be heavy on symbolism. But if any of Mauricio Pochettino, Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli go, the team could break up at speed. RSA pre-match grumble-off between the respective fans here would be quite the spectacle, with Hammers bemoaning their loss of identity on and off the pitch since the London Stadium move and Everton fans simmering with discontent over their unappealing displays under Sam Allardyce. A common thread between them though might be a measure of respect for David Moyes. For all that the Scot’s reputation has tumbled in the past five years, Everton have struggled to regain the consistency and status they had under Moyes while he has at least provided West Ham with sufficient steel and organisation to survive, though fans remain ambivalent about his style and whether he’s the man for the job long-term. With Moyes confident enough to be challenging West Ham’s owners with statements about his future ambitions for the club, he can strengthen his hand with a convincing win over his former club, who also have some managerial issues to resolve, as Wayne Rooney’s wavering over his commitment to the club demonstrates. TDBurnley’s home games have been a struggle. We mean that, for the most part, in a positive sense, because they are arguably the best pound-for-pound team in the ision. Their matches have been tough and uncompromising. In 18 league games at Turf Moor, Burnley have scored 15 and conceded 15. The end-of-season atmosphere may be conducive to the players of both sides having fun of the less masochistic kind. Burnley will stay seventh whatever happens, though Bournemouth could ensure back-to-back top-ten finishes if results go their way. With both sides overachieving spectacularly, this match should also be a celebration of that pariah species: the English manager.

Delicate, early stalks are best steamed and served with buttery hollandaise: here’s a foolproof recipe you can have on the table in 10 minutes.Cut the butter into roughly 1cm cubes. The butter should be fridge-cold, and preferably unsalted, so it’s easier to control the seasoning of the sauce. Put it in a small, heavy-based saucepan and, as insurance against disaster, fill the sink with cold water and boil a small amount in the kettle (see steps 4 and 7).Separate the eggs, and reserve the whites for something else –meringues, mousses, whisky sours or depressingly low-fat omelettes. They’ll keep, covered, in the fridge for a couple of days, or freeze in ice cube trays or bags (make sure you label the latter, so you know how many are in there). Put the yolks in the pan with the butter and add two tablespoons of cold water.Turn the heat on very low under the cold pan and start stirring – it’s easiest to start with a wooden spoon. As the butter gradually melts, the sauce will begin to thicken: do not be tempted to hurry the process by turning the heat up, or the mixture is likely to curdle. The sides of the pan should be cool enough to touch at all times.Keep stirring vigorously then, as the butter melts, switch to whisking – it’s important that you now don’t stop whisking until the sauce is ready, so if the doorbell rings, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink (see step 1) to halt the cooking process, otherwise you risk the egg scrambling before it has a chance to form an emulsion with the butter.Once all the butter has melted, turn up the heat very slightly and whisk vigorously until the sauce has thickened sufficiently for your purposes (see step 8). If the sauce begins to steam at any point, plunge the pan into the cold water in the sink at once, and keep whisking until it calms down.Add a tablespoon of lemon juice, then season the sauce to taste. Keep warm until ready to serve: hollandaise will not reheat successfully, so it’s best eaten at once, but if you do have to make it in advance, it’s best stored in a Thermos flask or in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water.You may be able to rescue a curdled sauce by whisking in a little boiling water (hence the kettle in step 1), but if that fails to fix the problem, pour the split sauce into a heatproof jug, clean the pan and whisk another egg yolk with a splash of water in there. Gradually whisk in the curdled hollandaise until it’s all incorporated, then carry on where you left off.I like my hollandaise fairly liquid when serving it with asparagus, because it can be poured over the steamed spears, but if you’re using it as a dip or making eggs benedict, you may prefer a more mayonnaise-like consistency. If it thickens too much, whisk in a little hot water from the kettle (see step 1) to thin it down.For béarnaise, simmer four tablespoons of white-wine vinegar with four tablespoons of water, a finely chopped shallot and three tarragon stalks stripped of their leaves, until reduced by half. Cool, strain, then add to the hollandaise at step 2, and stir in the chopped tarragon leaves at the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281ac3a8686cf33c361c0e90253c5790edba5843/0_52_5376_3226/master/5376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac4c741bfd519cd7b95abc987da32c02","title":"cities across uk submit bids to be second home of channel 4","story":"Shortlist of contenders to host new production hub will be announced on 30 MayMore than a dozen cities across the UK – including Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Birmingham – are expected to formally submit their bids on Friday to become the home of Channel 4’s second headquarters.A shortlist of contenders to host the new production hub will be announced on 30 May, with the winning city unveiled on 1 October. The contest has sparked a fierce battle between local politicians who are keen to attract hundreds of high-profile jobs to their region.Channel 4 won a drawn-out battle with the government against being privatised and forced to move its entire operation out of the capital.

The broadcaster has said its second base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure. Channel 4 has also pledged to build smaller regional “creative hubs” in two additional cities spend substantially more money on programming from production companies based outside London and co-host Channel 4 News from a studio outside the capital.Birmingham has long been seen as the leading candidate, with the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, saying he was confident of bringing the broadcaster to the region.Glasgow’s bid has become a major cause for the Scottish government, with the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, backing the bid and her Scottish National party holding a debate in the Westminster parliament to make the case.The Sheffield bid, chaired by the former Labour sports minister Richard Caborn, says the city offers “unrivalled” expertise and digital knowledge, while Leeds has promised “fascinating cultures, ersity and talents that are worth being discovered and showcased”.Smaller towns and cities, ranging from Leamington to Port Talbot, have expressed an interest in applying for one of the broadcaster’s creative hubs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab26df12e11fc524f7287b28d981baf4c627194/0_81_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=475cd4adad69826a2f753f0ad1608704","title":"airline tickets return payments delta santander","story":"Passing the buck after iding return tickets into two paymentsA year ago you featured a letter from a reader who was charged twice after booking flights with Delta airlines. It is still happening. I bought a £2,367.82 return flight with Delta and my credit card has been charged for the outward and inward-bound tickets inidually. The full sum for both has also been put on hold, meaning I’ve effectively paid twice. Delta advises that it is my bank, Santander, which is at fault. Santander claims to have never heard of this problem and says the ringfenced sum should be unfrozen within five days. This means I’m in danger of exceeding my credit card limit until the second sum is released. GT, Hindhead, SurreyOnline forums report similar experiences from travellers who have purchased airline tickets.When you use a debit or credit card, the merchant pre-authorises the sum with your bank to ensure that you have enough funds to settle the debt.This is then reserved by the bank until the transaction is completed or cancelled, or until the pre-authorisation period expires, usually after three to seven days.Although the pre-authorised sum is removed from the available balance, it is not actually debited.According to Santander, Delta pre-authorised the total £2,367.82 cost of the return flight, but when it came to requesting the money, the airline split the cost into two payments of £1,183.91.“As a result, the requested sums did not match the pre-authorised amount and both transactions were debited from the balance, although the £2,367.82 was not actually paid out,” says Santander.“On review, whilst Santander is not at fault, we have offered the customer £50 as a gesture of goodwill for any confusion and inconvenience this may have caused.”Delta explains that it splits return airfares in two to benefit from a lower credit card fee rate and insists the fault lies with banks who should release the hold on reserved funds once the payment has gone through.The same thing happened in the case I featured last May.Although the pre-authorised sum will be reapplied to a customer’s balance in due course, it’s extraordinary that banks and airlines have not worked out a way to avoid this apparent bill shock instead of passing the buck to each other.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

By  Sam KnightIf you have been wearing glasses for years, like me, it can be surprising to discover that you perceive the world thanks to a few giant companies that you have never heard of. Worrying about the fraying edge of motorway lights at night, or words that slide on the page, and occasionally spending a fortune at the opticians is, for many of us, enough to think about. And spectacles are unusual things. It is hard to think of another object in our society which is both a medical device that you don’t want and a fashion accessory which you do.Buying them, in my experience anyway, is a fraught, somewhat exciting exercise that starts in a darkened room, where you contemplate the blurred letters and the degeneration of your visual cortex, and ends in a bright, gallery-like space where you enjoy the spry feel of acetate in your fingers, listen to what you are told, pay more than you were expecting to, and look forward to inhabiting a new, slightly sharper version of your existing self.But what we see masks the underlying structure of the global eyewear business. Over the last generation, just two companies have risen above all the rest to dominate the industry. The lenses in my glasses – and yours too, most likely – are made by Essilor, a French multinational that controls almost half of the world’s prescription lens business and has acquired more than 250 other companies in the past 20 years.There is a good chance, meanwhile, that your frames are made by Luxottica, an Italian company with an unparalleled combination of factories, designer labels and retail outlets. Luxottica pioneered the use of luxury brands in the optical business, and one of the many powerful functions of names such as Ray-Ban (which is owned by Luxottica) or Vogue (which is owned by Luxottica) or Prada (whose glasses are made by Luxottica) or Oliver Peoples (which is owned by Luxottica) or high-street outlets such as LensCrafters, the largest optical retailer in the US (which is owned by Luxottica), or John Lewis Opticians in the UK (which is run by Luxottica), or Sunglass Hut (which is owned by Luxottica) is to make the marketplace feel more varied than it actually is.Between them, Essilor and Luxottica play a central, intimate role in the lives of a remarkable number of people. Around 1.4 billion of us rely on their products to drive to work, read on the beach, follow the whiteboard in biology lessons, type text messages to our grandchildren, land aircraft, watch old movies, write dissertations and glance across restaurants, hoping to look slightly more intelligent and interesting than we actually are. Last year, the two companies had a combined customer base that is somewhere between Apple’s and Facebook’s, but with none of the hassle and scrutiny of being as well known.The creation of EssilorLuxottica is a big deal. It will have knock-on consequences for opticians and eyewear manufacturers from Hong Kong to Peru. But it is also a response to an unprecedented moment in the story of human vision – namely, the accelerating degradation of our eyes. For several thousand years, human beings have lived in more or less advanced societies, reading, writing and doing business with one another, mostly without the aid of glasses. But that is coming to an end. No one is exactly sure what it is about early 21st-century urban living – the time we spend indoors, the screens, the colour spectrum in LED lighting, or the needs of ageing populations – but the net result is that across the world, we are becoming a species wearing lenses. The need varies depending where you go, because different populations have different genetic predispositions to poor eyesight, but it is there, and growing, and probably greater than you think. In Nigeria, around 90 million people, or half the population, are now thought to need corrective eyewear.At the same time, across the developing world, a slower and more complex process is underway, as populations age and urbanise and move indoors to work. The history of eyewear tells us that people do not, as a rule, start wearing glasses because they notice everything has gone a little out of focus. It is in order to take part in new forms of entertainment and labour. The mass market in spectacles did not emerge when they were invented, in 13th-century Italy, but 200 years later, alongside the printed word in Germany, because people wanted to read.In 2018, an estimated 2.5 billion people, mostly in India, Africa and China, are thought to need spectacles, but have no means to have their eyes tested or to buy them. “The visual ide”, as NGOs call it, is one of those vast global shortcomings that suddenly makes sense when you think about it. Across the developing world, straightforward myopia and presbyopia, the medical name for longsightedness, have been linked with everything from high road deaths to low educational achievement and poor productivity in factories. Eye-health campaigners call it the largest untreated disability in the world.It is also a staggering business opportunity. Essilor and Luxottica know this. It was Essilor that worked out and first publicised the 2.5 billion statistic, in 2012. “For 2,000 years people were living mainly outside,” said Hubert Sagnières, Essilor’s chairman and chief executive, when we met recently in Paris. “Suddenly, we live inside, and we use this.” He tapped his mobile phone on the table. The legal and technical details of the EssilorLuxottica merger will take a few years to iron out, but Sagnières was transparent about its mission: to equip the planet with eyewear over the coming decades. “I am driving a very profitable company,” Sagnières told me. “You know, between 2020 and 2050, governments will not solve all the problems of the world.”The looming power of EssilorLuxottica is the subject of morbid obsession within the eyewear world. Everyone knows the new company is poised to have a profound impact on the way that we are going to see. “Forgive me,” said one longtime entrepreneur in the sector. “But it is nothing short of control of the industry.” One investor described the new corporation as a “category killer”. In many conversations, people described its arrival, which would have been genuinely unthinkable a generation ago, as both extraordinary and somehow inevitable at the same time. That struck me as the kind of contradiction you come across more often in a person than in a business. And it is true of EssilorLuxottica and, to some extent, the business of vision itself, because it is – to an amazing degree – the legacy of a single man.Leonardo Del Vecchio is the patron, legend and haunting spirit of the global eyewear business. He is its Citizen Kane and its Captain Ahab. His father died before he was born his mother was poor and he was raised in an orphanage in wartime Milan, where he went out to work as a metal engraver at the age of 14. In 1961, Del Vecchio opened a workshop in the town of Agordo, in the Dolomite mountains. He was 25, and starting out on his own. The valley around Agordo was emptying out because of the closure of a mine, and the town was giving away land to companies that were willing to move there. Del Vecchio asked for 3,000 sq metres on the riverbank to build a factory to make parts for spectacles. He had a young family, and in time, he built a house next door to the workshop so he could step from one to the other, starting his day at 3am.Over the next half century, Del Vecchio grew his company, which was called Luxottica, into the world’s greatest maker of glasses frames. In an industry that was traditionally fragmented and small-scale, the totality of Del Vecchio’s ambition took his rivals by surprise. He sought to control every element in the business, from the metal alloys of the hinges to the stores where eyewear is sold. “Never assume that you have arrived, or look at the world as your only point of reference,” he liked to say. In a series of audacious takeovers, Del Vecchio acquired brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley and Persol, and signed contracts with fashion houses such as Armani, Ralph Lauren and Chanel. He built factories in China, acquired vision insurance schemes in the US and retail chains on four continents.Since 1994, Del Vecchio has been Italy’s highest inidual taxpayer and the country’s second-richest man. A few years ago, people thought his career had run its course. But in January 2017, at the age of 81, Del Vecchio announced the greatest deal of his life, in which he also secured the final missing part for his frames – the lenses – when Luxottica agreed to merge with Essilor. “He wants to do this merger,” a former colleague said, “thinking he will leave behind this great company that will last for 100 years.”When I arrived in Agordo one recent afternoon, it was thinking about starting to snow. The town rests among steep wooded hills and the bare grey sides of mountains. The blue buildings of the Luxottica factory, with Del Vecchio’s house still standing by the entrance, glowed across the river. Although the plant is now merely one of the company’s 12 frame manufacturing facilities, which stretch from São Paulo in Brazil to Dongguan in southern China, the founding in Agordo remains Luxottica’s organising myth. Every year, Del Vecchio hosts a Christmas dinner for the plant’s 4,500 workers (the town of Agordo has a population of 4,000), which is entertained by an Italian pop star of his choosing. “People are screaming and crying when he comes in,” said Giorgio Striano, Luxottica’s chief operating officer. In Agordo, Del Vecchio is referred to as simply, “Il Presidente”.For the company’s 30th anniversary, in 1991, Del Vecchio renovated some 15th-century stables in the middle of Agordo and opened a private glasses museum. The curator, Caterina Francavilla, who is the daughter of Del Vecchio’s longtime deputy, showed me round before she closed up for the day. The first glasses were almost certainly made in northern Italy in the last decades of the 13th century. (Lenses are called lenses because they looked like lentils.) But for centuries after their invention, spectacles and other magnifying lenses were mostly rejected by medical men, who warned of their unnaturalness and recommended potions to correct people’s eyesight instead. In The Perfect Oculist, of 1666, Robert Turner, a London doctor, recommended turtle’s blood and the powdered head of a bat for the treatment of squints. For weak eyesight, you might try wearing cow’s eyes around your neck.The cabinets in Del Vecchio’s museum traced the evolution from the leather frames and hinged bridges of the middle ages to the gold rims of the 19th century. There were opera glasses designed by Napoleon for his Polish mistress, Maria Walewska a pair of Emperor Franz Joseph’s spectacles and some pink “occhiali appartenenti a Elton John.” No one knows why it took 400 years to put the arms on glasses – which are known as temples, and were pioneered in London in the early 18th century – so they finally sat comfortably on people’s ears. To mark another historic milestone, one cabinet also held a copy of Luxottica’s slender debut catalogue, from 1971, when the company made its first complete frames.On a shelf near the door of the museum, I spotted A Man Who Sees Far, an official Luxottica biography of Del Vecchio, which was published in 1991. I expected the optical world to be genteel and polite, and was taken aback whenever conversations turned to the personal charisma, and menace, of Del Vecchio. “He’s the godfather,” said Dean Butler, who founded LensCrafters in 1983. (Del Vecchio bought it in 1995.) “The godfather, to me, is the guy. He runs it.” One former senior Luxottica executive told me: “Honestly, he kind of rules by fear.” Very few opticians would even mention Del Vecchio’s name – lending him a Voldemort-like aura – for fear of offending him, however unlikely that might be. One talked about “getting a horse’s head in the bed”. Another concluded our interview by saying: “You can quote me as long as it sounds like I am sucking Del Vecchio’s dick.”I took A Man Who Sees Far back to my hotel. Even in the company’s hagiography, Del Vecchio comes across as improbably driven and unfeeling. The biographer struggles to get a few words with Il Presidente as he crosses the tarmac to his private jet. (Del Vecchio rarely gives interviews he declined to speak to me.) “There were no kisses, no cuddles,” his eldest daughter, Marisa, recalls in the book. “Frankly, we were scared of him.”Del Vecchio built the empire of Luxottica on two ideas. The first was to do everything itself. After the company’s initial progression from parts to frames in the early 1970s, it set out, step by step, to control the entire process of making and selling glasses, from acquiring the raw materials to selling its own products in its own stores. No one had done this before Del Vecchio. “There is a simplicity to him,” one former colleague told me. “To him it is a very simple equation: I make the best stuff, why doesn’t everybody buy it?”For the first 25 years, Luxottica stayed on the wholesale side of the industry – “behind the curtain”, as it is known – selling its glasses through opticians to the public. In the 1990s, however, Del Vecchio decided he wanted a retail network too. First, he got Luxottica listed on the New York stock exchange, an almost-unheard of move for a mid-sized Italian business. “A lot of big experts said it was impossible,” said Roberto Chemello, the chief executive at the time. Luxottica later estimated the listing to have been worth around $100m in advertising in the US – and it laid the ground for Del Vecchio’s hostile takeover of US Shoe, a conglomerate that owned LensCrafters, the country’s largest optical chain, in 1995. On paper, the deal appeared outlandish. US Shoe was five times larger than Luxottica, and its board did not want to sell. Having its own shops would also put Luxottica in direct competition with the thousands of optometrists it had been supplying for decades. “You have to be not only courageous,” said Chemello, of the transaction, “but a little bit crazy.” Luxottica bought US Shoe for $1.4bn.Once the deal was done, Del Vecchio promptly broke up US Shoe, whose roots went back to 1879, until all that was left were the LensCrafters stores that he wanted in the first place, which he proceeded to fill with Luxottica frames. “That is exactly the formula they have used ever since,” said Jeff Cole, the former chief executive of Cole National Corporation, an even larger optical retailer that sold out to Luxottica in 2004. “When they buy a company, they spend a little time figuring it out and kick out all the other suppliers.”In the factory in Agordo, I saw dual-armed robots pinning together the front and temples of Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and basket after basket of metal frames being dunked in a series of chemical baths to coat and colour them. Glasses may appear to be relatively simple objects, but they involve between 180 and 230 manufacturing stages to produce. With its own designers, lasers and massive, quietly humming machines, Luxottica can take a pencil sketch to global production in about three weeks. “We are in a closed loop,” said Striano, the operations chief. Taking into account all the different colours and face shapes (Japanese noses are not the same as Latino noses), Luxottica has around 27,000 models in production at any one time. Its plants turn out 400,000 pairs of frames per day. I asked Striano if any other company came close. “I think nobody,” he said.Del Vecchio’s second great insight is the one that changed the nature of the optical business – and that was to combine it with the fashion industry. Although designers such as Pierre Cardin and Christian Dior had been experimenting with frames since the 1960s, Del Vecchio saw a way to take their ideas, and more importantly, their labels, to a mass market. In 1988, he signed a licensing deal with Giorgio Armani, another self-made tycoon, who had started out as a window-dresser at a department store in Milan. The deal transformed the glasses game. Until then, consumers in Europe and America who wanted fancy spectacles had to rely on staid, industry names such as Zeiss, Rodenstock or Silhouette. After the Armani deal, they could buy Prada, Gucci and Chanel, and they were willing to pay for it. “It created something,” as one Luxottica manager artfully told me, “to make the needs where probably they are not.”People in the industry observe that taste in frames follows a roughly 30-year cycle, from metal, to rimless, to acetate and back again, in which familiar spectacle shapes recur and then disappear. The trend right now is towards metal, and designs that last flowered in Ronald Reagan’s America. In the “Style Area” in Agordo, on the factory’s first floor, I met Mario Mollo, a senior product manager. “You see now the 80s is becoming very popular,” he said. “You see shallow, very wide.”Mollo was poring over a desk of large-scale drawings of a new acetate frame for Oliver Peoples, named “Leonardo”. Spectacle frames require a thousand barely noticeable design decisions, around the shape of the bridge, the thickness below the eyes, or the pantoscopic tilt (how the angle of the lens meets the front of your cornea). The Leonardo had an unusual temple, in which a curving piece of wire had to be sandwiched between two pieces of acetate. “Sometimes this one is not easy to find the right bending,” said Mollo, tracing his finger along the drawing. Like every other senior Luxottica figure I met in Agordo, Mollo was Italian, male, dressed in cashmere, and wearing a pair of the company’s frames. On a workbench a few feet away, there was a pair of €4,000 (£3,500) Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana sunglasses that were hand-painted in Sicily, made out of wood and looked like a carnival float. “With sun, you can go totally crazy,” said Mollo. Luxottica had made only 100 for the entire world. “Crazy,” said Mollo, “but sold out.”The transformation of glasses from a medical device to a means of self-expression, like clothes or sneakers, has been a source of joy for millions of people. But it has also obscured their original purpose, and complicated efforts to distribute them as easily as, say, mosquito nets or aspirin. When I mentioned this to Mollo, he recalled a recent trip he had taken with Luxottica’s corporate social responsibility programme, conducting eye tests and distributing glasses in rural China. “They were so happy having the possibility to see. They were hugging us. It was really not for fashion,” he said. “Then they started, you know, looking at themselves,” – Mollo paused for a second – “and the fashion moment arrived.”The fusion of the fashion industry and the optical business is now regarded as complete. Until recently, eye-health charities and campaigners used to distribute thousands of pairs of secondhand glasses from richer countries to poorer populations that lacked them. In 2011, the World Health Organization advised them to stop – in part because people were refusing to wear outdated styles. “Being poor doesn’t mean we want to look stupid, you know,” Prof Kovin Naidoo, who runs the Brien Holden Institute, one of the world’s leading eye-health NGOs, told me.My last stop in Agordo was Luxottica’s sample room, a broad, quiet, carpeted space looking out over the river. The room contains every current Luxottica design, arranged on various tables and ranked in order of sales. The system has been in place since the plant was built in 1972, and during that time, it has been the domain of Luigi Francavilla, Luxottica’s deputy chairman, who is now in his early 80s. “Glasses are beautiful,” he said, pausing among the hierarchies of Ralph Lauren, Valentino and Bulgari models. “Especially the ones that sell the most.”It was snowing outside and Francavilla was wearing a thick blue cardigan. One of the first things he did was to take my glasses off my face to identify the tortoiseshell acetate, which is known as Havana. His own glasses were a pair of rimless Ray-Bans with pink carbon-fibre temples. Luxottica bought Ray-Ban from Bausch \u0026amp Lomb, one of the 20th century’s great optical companies, in 1999. At the time, the label was washed up. You could buy a pair of Aviators at a petrol station for $19 (£14). “It was a train smash,” a former senior Luxottica executive told me. “They were selling Wayfarers at Walmart.”Del Vecchio paid $645m (£476m) for Ray-Ban. During the negotiations, he promised to protect thousands of jobs at four factories in the US and Ireland. Three months later, he closed the plants and shifted production to China and Italy. Over the next year and a half, Luxottica withdrew Ray-Ban from 13,000 retail outlets, hiked their prices and radically improved the quality: increasing the layers of lacquer on a pair of Wayfarers from two to 31. In 2004, to the disbelief of many of his subordinates, del Vecchio decided that Ray-Ban, which had been invented for American pilots in the 1930s, should branch out from sunglasses into optical lenses, too. “A lot of us were sceptical. Really? Ray. Ban. Banning rays from the sun?” the former manager said. “But he was right.”How did just two companies – one in frames, and one in lenses – come to dominate something as generic, as obvious, as glasses? It’s almost as if the world had one manufacturer for pens, and another for ink. The conditions that have allowed for the rise of Essilor and Luxottica are rooted, deep down, in the way spectacles are sold. Until the end of the 19th century, you could buy a cheap pair of glasses – for reading or for distance – out of a rack in Woolworth’s, or from a jewellery shop, or a guy in the street. Eyewear was a craft of tinkerers and inventors. “I this evening did buy me a pair of green spectacles,” Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary on Christmas Eve 1666, “to see whether they will help my eyes or no.” (They didn’t Pepys’ failing eyesight forced him to give up his journal three years later.)It was the birth of the optometry profession, around 1900, that changed things. This was a new breed of sober, respectable spectacle-sellers – not unlike pharmacists – who wanted to standardise eye tests and to restrict the sale of glasses to licensed professionals. Their aim, for the most part, was to raise standards. Eyeglass pedlars in the 18th and 19th centuries were notorious for scams and faulty lenses. But there was also another compelling reason to take a cheap, widely available product and put it in the hands of a few authorised sellers – and that was to make money.The first opticians had a tough time of it. They were disdained by ophthalmologists – proper eye doctors, who had trained in hospitals and considered themselves above the tawdry trade in glasses. The first optometry course in the US was taught at Columbia University’s physics department because it was not allowed inside the medical school. (A remnant of this prejudice still holds: within the optical industry, optometrists are always being teased for their chippiness and self-importance. “One step above dermatology,” a former Luxottica executive sniped to me).But the new professionals persevered and, in a way, the story of optometry for much of the 20th century was of finding new ways to protect their patch. Across Europe and in the US, optometry laws and regulations were passed to control the prescription and selling of eyewear. Many of these had a “doctorly” aspect, but they also had the effect of creating a highly opaque marketplace. For a long time, opticians fought all forms of advertising, for example, which might force them to spell out their prices and allow customers to shop around. In some places, this reached ridiculous extremes: in Kentucky, for a time, optometrists’ signs could not be more than four inches high. Under Britain’s Opticians Act of 1958, the display of prices was banned altogether, which meant that opticians were more or less free to make them up on the spot. “The price would come from a little black book,” one veteran practitioner told me. “There was a lot of sharp practice around.”This was when Essilor came on the scene. In 1972, Essel and Silor, two French optical companies, merged and began sell aggressively into the US market. Essilor specialised in plastic lenses, which were replacing glass, and it also had a magical product: “Varilux”, the world’s first progressive lens, invented by an Essel engineer named Bernard Maitenaz in 1959. Progressive lenses allow people who are both long- and shortsighted – typically older customers – to combine their prescriptions into a single, graduated lens. The early Varilux models were experimental and not everyone could adapt to them, but they were probably the most important innovation in eyewear since the invention of bifocals around the time of the French revolution. The company set out to make sure that Varilux and the rest of its products (Essilor’s current sales manual runs to around 400 pages) were sold in every optometrist in the world.Lenses are the pixie dust of the optical business. Barely anyone knows what they are made of, how they are constructed and, especially at the high end, exactly how they work. For the last half century, persuading opticians to prescribe Essilor, as opposed to Hoya or Zeiss, the company’s main rivals, has been painstaking, face-to-face work. One British optician, who stocks Essilor, described it to me this way: “Is there a difference between an Audi, a BMW or a Mercedes? Probably not. But you prefer that badge to that badge, or the way they win hearts and minds.” For years, the company has brought opticians to Paris and its Essilor Academy, where they are wined and dined and taught about its latest products. “It’s not really bribes it’s the way it works,” one industry veteran told me.And when all else fails, Essilor – like its rivals, and like all wholesalers – uses financial incentives to keep its customers satisfied. Opticians and industry analysts that I spoke to for this article described how Essilor uses so-called “spiff money” – offering stores large, multi-year discounts and cash bonuses for selling its products – in order to squeeze out the competition. “Essilor wants to dominate this industry worldwide,” one retailer told me. “They are actually a well run company. They are not a ruthless company. But they get away with all this crap which in any other industry would be anti-consumer.”Some opticians call Essilor “The Big E”. The company boasts of supplying between 300,000 and 400,000 stores around the world – three or four times as many as Luxottica. “The strategy has to be absolutely global,” Sagnières, the chief executive, told me. “Not just for the rich or poor.” The company has not restricted itself to lenses by any means. If Luxottica has spent the last quarter of a century buying up the most conspicuous elements of the optical business (the frames, the brands and the high-street chains) then Essilor has busied itself in the invisible parts, acquiring lens manufacturers, instrument makers, prescription labs (where glasses are put together) and the science of sight itself.The company holds more than 8,000 patents and funds university ophthalmology chairs around the world. In deals that rarely make the business pages, Essilor buys up Belgian optical laboratories, Chinese resin manufacturers, Israeli instrument makers and British e-commerce websites. You can find threads on optometrist message boards with headings like “Essilor Has Purchased and Now Owns (Insert Company Name Here)”, which attempt to record all the independent lens makers and laboratories that used to exist. Within the industry, the Big E is generally considered less rapacious than Del Vecchio’s Luxottica people regard it instead as a kind of unstoppable, enveloping tide.The companies saw themselves differently too. “I think Essilor, while not a model company by any means, has a moral purpose,” the former manager said. “With Luxottica, it’s just lip service. It is all about domination.” The most infamous Luxottica deals carried an edge of brutality. In 2001, the company clashed with Oakley, the world’s hottest make of sunglasses at the time. Luxottica had just bought Sunglass Hut, which sold a third of the US’s sunglasses, and Del Vecchio demanded that all its suppliers drop their prices. Oakley refused. In the summer of 2001, the company’s founder Jim Jannard flew to Milan to meet Del Vecchio and strike a deal. Jannard had founded Oakley out of the back of his car in 1975. According to Forbes magazine, at the end of their conversation, he said he hoped the two men would one day be friends. “We will never be friends,” Del Vecchio reportedly replied.After Oakley sued in 2001, Luxottica issued a statement “denying the allegations in Oakley’s complaint in all material respects” and the case was settled out of court. But Luxottica won the war, buying Jannard’s company for $2.1bn (£1.5bn) in 2007.By that time, Del Vecchio appeared ready to retire. In the summer of 2004, as he approached his 70th birthday, Luxottica’s founder handed over day-to-day control of the company to Andrea Guerra, a young chief executive he hired from Indesit, the Italian white goods company. Under Guerra, Luxottica rationalised its manufacturing, shifting more production to China. It also became more stable and predictable. The share price trebled. But according to several former executives who were close to Guerra, he was opposed to any deal with Essilor, seeing the company as a long-term rival. (Guerra declined to speak with me). “He did not want to merge with Essilor,” a colleague said. “He wanted to protect us in a different way.”In 2014, however, Del Vecchio came back to work. He was 79. “We were all pretty shocked,” a former senior Italian executive told me. But it became clear that Del Vecchio was worried about what would happen to Luxottica when he dies. “His most precious child is this company,” the US manager told me. Del Vecchio has six children from four marriages to three women (he remarried his second wife, Nicoletta Zampillo, in 2010) but he has always insisted they will never succeed him. According to several senior figures at Luxottica, Del Vecchio came to believe that folding Luxottica into Essilor was the best way for his work to endure, and informal talks between the two companies began.In many ways, the final chapter of Del Vecchio’s rule at Luxottica has been chaotic and disorienting. Guerra was soon forced out. After that, Del Vecchio went through four chief executives in three years. In his early 80s, he is no longer the force that he once was. Subordinates told me that Del Vecchio can no longer work a full week and sometimes loses his place in meetings, while demanding to sign off on decisions as small as the floor-plans of new Luxottica stores. Dozens of senior managers have left. “He really doesn’t trust anyone,” one told me.But throughout his shaky return, Del Vecchio kept his eyes on the prize, meeting in secret with Sagnières, the CEO and chairman of Essilor, until, by the summer of 2016, Sagnières said, “it was obvious” that the deal would go ahead. When the two men announced the formation of the combined company on 16 January last year in a call to investors, Del Vecchio’s voice came on the line. “I’m very pleased to be here with you today,” he said, “to present the achievement of a lifetime dream.”Over the coming decades, EssilorLuxottica will have the power to decide how billions of people will see, and what they can expect to pay for it. Public health systems are always likely to have more urgent problems than poor eyesight: until 2008, the World Health Organization did not measure rates of myopia and presbyopia at all. The combined company can choose to interpret its mission more or less however it wants. It could share new technologies, screen populations for eye problems and flood the world with good-quality, affordable eyewear or it could use its commercial dominance to choke supply, jack up prices and make billions. It could go either way.The bigger picture takes a moment to discern. Late last year, I visited Britain’s most important optical collection, which is kept in the basement of the College of Optometrists, a townhouse around the corner from Charing Cross Station. For the last 19 years, Neil Handley, the college’s historian, has been cataloguing 27,000 items donated by opticians and eyewear manufacturers, discovering the story of the industry as he goes along. “It’s under the radar,” he said. “It’s not something that is talked about.” When I asked Handley about the creation of EssilorLuxottica, he pointed to an old display of British spectacle parts, made by a firm called Hadley in Surrey in the 1930s. Until the 1970s, and the rise of cheap manufacturing in China, Britain used to have hundreds of frame-makers up and down the country.Today it has four.“What you are seeing is a potential monopoly, and the risk that brings,” said Handley. While it’s easy to fixate on the brands and the profits of the giants of the optical sector, the industry as a whole must expand dramatically in order to serve the world’s growing, ageing populations and increasing myopia among the young. “The danger is if their proposed answer to these problems turns out not to be the answer,” said Handley. “They have stifled all opposition, and so nobody else has the chance to come up with the right answer.” The stakes are highest in parts of the world that currently do not have anything like enough access to eyewear – what the industry calls the “white spaces” of Africa and parts of Latin America and Asia.“It is always better if there is more ersity in the market, and less dominance,” said Prof Naidoo, of the Brien Holden Institute, about the impact of the merger. “I don’t think anyone can argue with that.” In 2013, Naidoo was one of the authors on a groundbreaking paper that forecast that half the world’s population will be myopic by 2050 – almost 5 billion people. In the course of a single generation, across the world, from Inuit communities in Alaska to secondary-school students in Northern Ireland, researchers have recorded a rough doubling in the number of people who become short-sighted as children.The main reason, as far as anyone can agree, is a reduction in the time that they spend outdoors. Sunlight helps to moderate levels of dopamine, which in turn influence the development of the eye. Too much dopamine means eyeballs grow too long, and become oblong in shape, focusing light in front of the retina, rather than on it. Vision campaigners forecast that the myopia epidemic will put enormous strain on health systems across the developing world, which are already unable to equip their populations with a medical device that has been around since the Middle Ages. “We are barely managing in healthcare systems to provide eyecare,” said Naidoo. He corrected himself. “Not barely. We are not managing. Can you imagine, when those numbers are doubling and tripling, what is going to happen?”Naidoo was reluctant to criticise EssilorLuxottica, however. In part that is because Essilor is the world’s leading commercial funder of research into eye health, and a prominent force in improving access to corrective lenses. (Naidoo sits on the board of the company’s Vision Impact Institute in Paris.) Essilor’s €200m R\u0026ampD budget is three times the size of the rest of the industry combined, and it has a ision called 2.5 New Vision Generation, named for the 2.5 billion people who currently need glasses but don’t have them. The company is investing in schemes such as mobile optometry, putting eye-health workers on motorbikes in Indonesia at network of around 4,000 village-level optical stores in India door-to-door salespeople in the favelas in Brazil and working with the Liberian health system to get its products to what it calls the “base of the pyramid”. Last month, Essilor pledged to provide 200m pairs of free ophthalmic lenses to the estimated 900 million people living in the Commonwealth without access to glasses.In some of the least-served markets in the world, Essilor is more or less the only game in town. In 2016, the company opened an office in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country of 78 million people and 200 optical stores. Last year, Essilor acquired a prescription laboratory in Ethiopia, which currently has roughly one ophthalmologist for every million people. (In European countries, the ratio is about a hundred times smaller.) In places like these, all that eye-health campaigners can do is watch, and hope. “If the merged organisation decreases that investment, that will be a tragedy,” said Naidoo. “And that risk is there, you know. We can just hope that the merged organisation will see there is an opportunity to grow more, rather than less.”No one at Luxottica was willing to speak in detail about its plans for the merged company. It was a different story when I visited Essilor’s global headquarters, which is on a quiet street of apartment blocks in Charenton-le-Pont, in south-east Paris. The company’s senior executives are, as a rule, noticeably more nerdy and less well-dressed than their Italian counterparts, but they are much more comfortable in their role as titans of the global optical industry. Sagnières, the company’s 62-year-old chief executive and chairman, had the guileless glee of a high-school geography teacher whose class had just aced their exams. “I won!” he said, describing the deal with Luxottica. “Anything can happen. I won already. You won. Your kids won! Seriously, this is how it is.”Sagnières told me that the company has calculated – on the basis that a simple pair of glasses costs €5 – that the world can be supplied with eyewear for around €500m a year for the next 30 years. Just as importantly, any investment that EssilorLuxottica ploughs into the bottom end of the market is likely to pay off in the end. “We know that in three or five or 10 years, one day their life will have changed that much that they will afford to pay $50 for a better lens or $50 for branded frames,” said Sagnières. “I am fine with that.”A few days later, I visited one of Essilor’s research facilities in a former lens factory in Créteil, on the southern edge of the city. In a room full of brightly coloured furniture and signs that said things like “How can boomers enjoy their vision in all light conditions?” I met Dr Norbert Gorny, the company’s head of R\u0026ampD. Gorny is a tall, direct, German veteran of the optical scene, who explained that Essilor has spent much of the last decade expanding what it calls “the acuity corridor” on its progressive lenses, to help people read digital devices as they move around, compared to the more static way we used to read books and newspapers. But the company is increasingly keen to reach what it calls its “Next Generation Consumers” – people in the developing world who don’t wear glasses yet. Gorny called them “The Uncorrected”.“We do things for the 2.5 billion uncorrected,” he said. “But we also do things for people’s needs that are not already expressed.” During the afternoon, he showed me rooms where researchers put on motion sensors, as if they are in a Hollywood studio, to measure the depth of vision required for everyday tasks. Gorny also talked teasingly about new lenses that the company is developing with unnamed tech companies to supersede Google’s failed “Google glass” project of a decade ago. This time around, the idea is to project information from the internet – maps, messages, and Twitter, I suppose – directly on to the back of people’s eyes. “You can read easily – always sharp – information about where to go, the email that you did not want to miss,” said Gorny. “I leave it to your fantasy.”In How We Got to Now, Steven Johnson’s book about innovation, he describes the crude reading lenses of medieval Europe as the first piece of technology “since the invention of clothing in Neolithic times, that ordinary people would regularly wear on their bodies.” It was possible, listening to Gorny and thinking of the teenagers of Seoul, urbanising populations in Africa, and people walking through European cities with their eyes fixed to their phones, to imagine a point where more or less the whole of humanity is watching the world through intermediating screens on their eyes. I asked Gorny whether he thought the 21st century, with its demographic changes, myopia epidemic and urge for digital information, would bring about a second optical revolution, in the manner of Germany’s printing presses in the 15th century. Will EssilorLuxottica become the Facebook of seeing? “I don’t know whether we are starting a revolution, witnessing a major change like we witnessed 500 years ago,” Gorny said. “What I believe is we are in the right industry at the right time.”The question is whether there is anyone, beyond its shareholders, that will be able to hold EssilorLuxottica to account. I’m not sure there is. The next few years might be rocky, as the new company grapples with its size and attempts to find a new leader who can define the corporation and its ultimate goals under the fading shadow of Del Vecchio. But after that, the field is open and the fundamentals are clear.On my way back to London, Gorny gave me a lift to the station. “There is nothing close to that firepower once the combination is done,” he said. “You have the global footprint. You can play all the courts.” And I thought about how one of the telling aspects of wearing glasses is that they help you notice everything else – and for the most part, see the world as it actually is – but it is only occasionally, through a chance reflection, or when you really take a moment to stop and look, that you see what is sitting on the top of your nose.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993efc7f18e978cd9b43dee3d7ffffe84951f6b5/554_59_4224_2535/master/4224.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e0d3d41c0182a9bff1c154045048ca","title":"how metoo revealed the central rift within feminism social individualist","story":"It’s not a generational ide, but rather a split between two competing visions of feminism – social and inidualist. By  Moira DoneganWhen the #MeToo moment began in earnest last October, many women felt optimistic, galvanised others felt uncomfortable. As stories of abuse and harassment accumulated in the media, men began to experience consequences for their treatment of women. Some lost jobs, others were demoted, many faced public embarrassment. The careers of men such as Hollywood producer and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, masturbating comedian Louis CK, and predatory actor Kevin Spacey were declared dead. Others, like the groping chef Mario Batali, took a temporary “step back” from their public lives. A reckoning seemed to be underway, and many women felt that it was long overdue.In the media and in private life, conversations about consent, hostile environments and power began, and there was a growing acknowledgment that a man’s unwanted sexual overtures were a symptom of broader social and political forces. Soon, these discussions were interrupted by hand-wringing and anger from male commentators – everyone from conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan to Donald Trump – who claimed the movement had gone too far before it really began. But unexpected ides emerged between feminists as well.Some feminists urged caution others wanted the reckoning to go further. But the most common complaint about #MeToo came from those who felt that the whole movement had very quickly become silly. Self-described feminists such as Daphne Merkin and Bari Weiss in the New York Times, Katie Roiphe in Harper’s, Germaine Greer in the Sydney Morning Herald and 100 French women in Le Monde complained that many of the incidents of harassment were too minor to warrant opprobrium. They argued that by grouping together such a wide spectrum of sexual misbehaviour, #MeToo had lost a sense of nuance. They called on women to toughen up. Whatever happened to no-nonsense rejections, they asked. Those who complained about harassment and assault, Merkin wrote, “perceive themselves to be as frail as Victorian housewives”. By this logic, women could solve the problem of sexual harassment and assault with good humour, patience and a high tolerance for pain.This disagreement was quickly characterised in the media as generational. Older feminists, we were told – say, anyone over 40 – were sinisterly complicit, laughably outdated, or just too scared of overstepping. Younger women, depending on who you asked, were either righteously passionate, naively idealistic, or out for blood.In part, this notion of a generational ide came from the feminist opponents and supporters of #MeToo themselves. In Harper’s, Roiphe derided the #MeToo movement as “Twitter feminism”, giving the impression that only narcissistic, social media-obsessed millennials want a reckoning over sexual assault. In her article criticising the direction #MeToo was taking, Bari Weiss emphasised the youth and naivety of an anonymous woman who made allegations against the comedian Aziz Ansari. Meanwhile, the feminist website Jezebel, whose readers and writers skew young, ran an article headlined “The Backlash to #MeToo is Second-Wave Feminism”, gesturing vaguely at a misguided crop of older feminist thinkers but not engaging much with those thinkers’ actual achievements and failures. Each side used age stereotypes, with varying degrees of cynicism – older women were crotchety or out of touch, younger women were egoists or spoiled children. None of this commentary seemed interested in the fact that the women coming forward with stories of sexual abuse were both young and old. #MeToo’s feminist detractors also come from different generations. At only 32, Weiss is young enough to be Merkin’s daughter, or Greer’s granddaughter.The #MeToo moment and its backlash made it clear that there really was a ide among feminists, but analysis of that ide cast it as a mere catfight, or a screaming match between weary mothers and teenage daughters. The implication was that the feminist debate unfolding around #MeToo is a kind of routine domestic drama, something we’ve seen before.This is a mistake. A closer look at the arguments being made by these two camps reveals a deeper, more serious intellectual rift. What’s really at play is that feminism has come to contain two distinct understandings of sexism, and two wildly different, often incompatible ideas of how that problem should be solved. One approach is inidualist, hard-headed, grounded in ideals of pragmatism, realism and self-sufficiency. The other is expansive, communal, idealistic and premised on the ideals of mutual interest and solidarity. The clash between these two kinds of feminism has been starkly exposed by #MeToo, but the crisis is the result of shifts in feminist thought that have been decades in the making.The central claim of the anti-#MeToo feminists is that the movement does not treat inidual women as moral agents with the capacity to say no, to enjoy and pursue sex, and to do wrong. From this perspective, women who come forward about their experiences of harassment or assault should often be given more responsibility for those experiences than the rhetoric of #MeToo assigns them. This thinking partakes in a long moral tradition – one that’s highly compatible with capitalism – in which personal responsibility, independence, and willingness to withstand hardship are revered as particularly valuable virtues. It’s an ethos of pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – from poverty into prosperity, or, in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ logic, from “feminine” victimhood into “masculine” strength. They believe that the pervasiveness of sexual harassment suggests that it is inevitable, and that the best response is not anger, but resolve. Theirs is a feminism that posits that inidual women have the power to make choices to diminish the negative impact of sexism, and to endure any sexist unpleasantness that can’t be avoided – if only they have the grit to handle it.On the other hand, there is the #MeToo movement. It might seem strange to assert that #MeToo can be spoken of as a single ideology at all – that this cultural moment, which has exposed such a broad array of bad behaviour across so many industries and disciplines, could ever be coherent enough to have an agenda. But #MeToo, as a social movement and as a personal gesture, makes certain assumptions that aren’t compatible with the intellectual habits of most mainstream feminisms that have preceded it. By saying “me too”, an inidual woman makes herself a part of a broader group, and chooses to stand with others who have been harassed, assaulted or raped. This solidarity is powerful. It is still rare to see such a large group of women identifying their suffering as women’s suffering, claiming that they have all been harmed by the same forces of sexism, and together demanding that those forces be defeated.In this light, the ersity and breadth of the #MeToo movement is not a weakness, but a strength. After all, if so many women, with so many different kinds of lives, have experienced the same sexist behaviour from men, then it becomes easier to believe that the problem goes beyond iniduals and instead relates to wider cultural forces. The ubiquity of sexual harassment means that an inidual can’t simply avoid it by making the right choices, or by steeling herself with forceful determination the demand that she do so begins to look absurd.Call it, then, a conflict between “inidualist” and “social” feminisms. In part, the rift is between visions of how to undertake the feminist project, of which tactics are best: whether through inidual empowerment, or through collective liberation. But there is a greater moral ide between these two strands of thought, because #MeToo and its critics also disagree over where to locate responsibility for sexual abuse: whether it is a woman’s responsibility to navigate, withstand and overcome the misogyny that she encounters, or whether it is the shared responsibility of all of us to eliminate sexism, so that she never encounters it in the first place.This tension, between inidualist and social feminisms, has dogged the women’s movement since its revival in the mid-20th century. According to the inidualist model of feminism, personal responsibility, inidual freedoms and psychological adjustments offer a woman meaningful routes out of the suffering imposed by patriarchy, and into equality with men. Many of the most famous western feminists have been working in this tradition. For instance, Betty Friedan, author of the hugely influential 1960s feminist text The Feminine Mystique, argued that sexist cultural codes prevent women from achieving personal happiness. Friedan, a psychologist by training, focused on the inner lives of white, American, middle-class women at midcentury. More recently, inidualist feminism found a high-profile advocate when Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published her memoir-cum-manifesto Lean In in 2013. Sandberg laments the lack of women in leadership positions, and her book is a how-to manual for women with lofty corporate ambitions.Social feminism has a similarly long, if less well-known, history. Soon after Friedan’s book became a bestseller, Italian feminists such as Leopoldina Fortunati and Silvia Federici began to formulate a different way of looking at the problems that women faced. As Marxists, they sought to analyse how men as a class related to women as a class. They were less interested in ideas of empowerment and self-actualisation than they were in isions of labour, living conditions and cold, hard cash. They argued that so-called “women’s work” – everything from mopping floors to dressing wounds to breastfeeding, cooking, prostitution, laundry and tending to the elderly – should not only be seen as work, but as essential to the capitalist wage-labour system. If men did not have these functions performed for them at home, these women argued, they would not be able to return to work and produce effectively. Male work in the factory relied upon female work in the home.When Federici’s Wages for Housework campaign launched in 1972, it attracted fierce public debate – first in Italy, and then in the US after Federici moved to New York and opened a Wages for Housework office in Brooklyn. The political mainstream found Federici’s idea ridiculous. Could she really mean that a woman should be paid for scrubbing the floors in her husband’s house? But the movement relied on the understanding that a wage was necessary for work to be seen as work, and for the people who did it to be seen as worthy of dignity and protection. More a rhetorical device than an immediate policy prescription, the demand “wages for housework” relied on a conception of women as a “class” in the same sense as a class of workers – a group of people with something in common who could organise on behalf of their shared interests.The Wages for Housework movement fizzled out, but its influence has lived on in campaigns for racial justice, gay rights, housing rights and sex workers’ rights. Behind Wages for Housework lay the idea that women’s oppression was widespread, that it had common features even for women who lived very different lives, and that it was more than just a personal experience – it was a political phenomenon. But because sexism beats so many people down, that also meant that there was a community of women who could pull each other up. Those who experience gendered oppression can band together to end it.Something similar is at stake in #MeToo’s assertions that sexual harassment and assault are systemic, and that women can unite to demand an end to them. While inidualist feminists such as Friedan and Sandberg have examined the problem of sexism by zooming in, to consider women’s psyches and attitudes, Wages for Housework zoomed out, to examine how women were oppressed by the economic forces of capitalism. #MeToo has a less ideological, more ad hoc approach to its analysis of patriarchy. But its gesture proceeds from the assumption that misogyny is structural, and that women have a shared interest in fighting it.This does not mean that #MeToo treats all women’s experiences as the same. The movement has included stories from women of different races, orientations and religions. It has brought testimony from women who are rich and poor, healthy and chronically ill, cis and trans, famous and anonymous. This variety has led to an increasing acknowledgment that misogyny takes different forms, and that not all women have access to the same tools used to mitigate it.At its best, #MeToo’s social feminism has been heavily influenced by black American feminist scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, whose work aims to confront the combined nature of racism and sexism in the lives of black women, and to analyse how, for the people who experience both racism and sexism, the phenomena don’t feel distinct at all. In her 1989 legal article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex, Crenshaw called for a new way of understanding oppression that she referred to as “intersectionality”. Put very simply, this meant taking into account the ways that oppression looks different for different people, and how iniduals experience oppression along more than one axis at once. In practice, Crenshaw’s approach suggests that an effective movement against patriarchal oppression must also confront other systemic inequalities – ones that lend power and viciousness to many women’s experiences of sexism.Intersectionality has given #MeToo a more expansive understanding of sexual harassment and assault. The gesture of saying “me too” implies solidarity with all women who have had these experiences, but the form the movement has taken has also allowed for it to be a specific, personal declaration, and for those testimonies to come from women with different stories and in different circumstances. For every anti-#MeToo feminist who scornfully asks, “Why didn’t you just leave?”, there have been dozens of women explaining the circumstances of their lives that effectively barred the door. Often, these stories have made it heartbreakingly clear that not everyone can risk their job by giving a firm, uncompromising “no” to a handsy boss or coworker that not everyone can afford to call an emergency cab that not everyone has the privileges that make it easy to act in the ways that the inidualist feminists so often prescribe.#MeToo’s sheer number of testimonies has vindicated theories of sexism as a universal, but not uniform, force –that is, as something that every woman will experience, but that every woman will experience in different ways. But in its solidarity, its public gesture of women coming together to demand an end to harassment and assault, the movement also continues the tradition of women’s class consciousness, unity and need for confrontation with systemic injustice. Call it the “too” of #MeToo: the understanding that meaningful liberation from misogyny will only be achieved collectively, with changes at the structural, cultural and institutional levels. Social feminism does not aspire to enable a few women to gain positions of power in patriarchal systems. It’s not about giving women “a seat at the table”. It’s about taking the table apart, so that we can build a new one together.This is not a simple proposition. As an approach, social feminism has real flaws, though its most significant weaknesses are not the ones that #MeToo’s prominent critics choose to address. The real weakness of social feminism is not that it encourages women to be oversensitive about discomforts, but that it is so broad. The call for women to unite can overlook the kinds of pain and conflict that can exist between them.After all, who do we mean when we talk about “women”? What experiences or conditions, exactly, do we identify as common to all women? It is difficult to generalise about so many people at once, and questions of injustice, inequality and privilege mean that doing so puts us at the risk of ignoring vital differences. Women are a varied bunch, and they encounter intersecting oppressions that are not of patriarchy’s exclusive making: racism, classism, ability and sexuality. Often, these oppressions are enforced by other women. There are vast gulfs that separate women from one another: gulfs of racism and money, of colonialism, bigotry, history, resentment, defensiveness, ignorance and hurt. It can be very hard to see each other across them.#MeToo, however, has made it clear that solidarity among women is possible. The working definition of “women”, as #MeToo has constructed it, can be understood simply: as everyone who has experienced misogyny. It’s a bleak kind of solidarity, this acknowledgment of shared suffering. But #MeToo has transformed that mournful acknowledgment into something much more hopeful. If the #MeToo movement has prompted many women to focus on misogynist behaviour with a unifying grief and anger, it has also led many of them to contemplate our shared power and common vision for a different world. When the social feminists of #MeToo call for changes that would make harassment, assault and other forms of misogyny rare, their very act of collective imagining makes such a world more possible: the more we stand together in this demand, the easier it becomes to imagine a world where respect is common, where cruelty is rare, where all of us think with more empathy and intelligence about the lives of others, and where being women will not doom us to suffering or limitation.Again, this is an old debate: whether feminism’s aim should be to transform society, or to better equip inidual women to navigate within it. But why, then, has this clash been framed as generational, when it is clear that the two visions of feminism have been doing battle for decades? Part of it, of course, is ageism and incuriosity – the reflexive tendency to presume that the old are too timid and the young are too reckless. And there is the idea, unique to feminism among all other strands of political thought, that feminism is a social movement that must occur in discrete, coherent and temporal “waves”.But another reason why #MeToo has been framed as a generational conflict is because the inidualist feminists of the anti-#MeToo backlash have framed their own resistance to the movement as grounded in wisdom, realism and, above all, maturity. To them, all this talk of a reimagined, recreated new world sounds hopelessly naive. Daphne Merkin summed up the tenor of the anti-#MeToo assessment in her article in the New York Times, when she wrote to the women coming forward: “Grow up, this is real life”.This is a common, but still very strange belief: that the epitome of maturity and personal strength is the resigned acceptance that the world cannot be better than it is, that we cannot be kinder to one another, that male entitlement, crassness and predation are permanent and unchangeable and must be endured. It is a bizarre conception of strength, one that dismisses as childish weakness any demand for a better world, any hope that things might one day be different. There is a way of thinking that makes this approach by the anti-#MeToo feminists seem strong and pragmatic. But there is another way of thinking that makes it seem very sad.In her book Trauma and Recovery, about the treatment of rape victims and other psychiatric patients who have undergone horrible abuse, the Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman writes of the temptation to sympathise with a patient’s abuser. “It is very tempting to take the side of the perpetrator,” she writes. “All the perpetrator asks is that the bystander do nothing. He appeals to the universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil. The victim, on the contrary, asks the bystander to share the burden of pain.” Something similar may be at work in the anti-#MeToo feminists’ desire to advocate for an inidualist feminism. Their call to sympathise more with the perpetrators of sexual assault, and to place greater responsibility for those assaults on the choices of women who experience them, is part of an effort not to feel implicated in the suffering of others, not to share that burden of pain. #MeToo and the reckoning that it has provoked has given us all knowledge we would rather not have – knowledge of just how normal some terrible things are, of just how much some of us have suffered. The anti-#MeToo feminists of the world are not the only ones who feel tempted to look away.

The group will include Brexiters Liam Fox and Michael Gove, along with leading remainer David Lidington, the minister for the Cabinet Office.The Brexiters’ preferred “max-fac” proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks, will be studied by remainers Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, along with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, a key leave supporter.Downing Street insiders suggested that each group of ministers had been picked for their relevant departmental responsibilities, rather than to give each proposal a “going over” by opponents. Neither Johnson nor the chancellor, Philip Hammond, were included in the working groups, with cabinet sources suggesting that they were considered to be the “ultras” on each side, meaning their involvement could have made discussions difficult. The ministers only have until Tuesday to examine their options, with civil servants’ support, leaving them little time to focus on detail. This has increased the likelihood that each team will conclude both options need yet more work. Whitehall officials believe they can persuade Brussels that a redrafted version of May’s preferred plan is workable, despite EU negotiators previously describing it as “magical thinking”.Cabinet sources claimed that few ministers were likely to shift from their established positions on post-Brexit customs arrangements. Fox is understood to be immovable over his opposition to the customs partnership, while friends of Davis have suggested he could quit over the issue. However, one senior Whitehall insider suggested the move could give the prime minister a “dignified way out” from her customs partnership plan, which has infuriated hard Brexiters who see it as a way of keeping the door open to staying in the customs union. One cabinet minister told the : “The prime minister wants to find a way through this that keeps the party together. Her instinct is to stick as closely to the status quo as she can get away with. “We’ll end up with a fudge on the customs union just so we can say we’ve delivered Brexit. She just wants to kick any decisions down the road for as long as she can.”A No 10 insider added: “We want to get the right solution. This will help”. It came as Labour accused the government of “effectively subverting democracy” after an announcement of coming government business made no mention of any major Brexit-related legislation to be debated in the House of Commons.Announcing the Commons schedule for the next fortnight, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house, gave no timings for the return of the EU withdrawal bill from the Lords, or any news on three other key Brexit-connected bills.The inaction will reinforce the sense of a government gridlocked over the Brexit process, with no agreement in cabinet over a future customs deal with the EU, and speculation ministers might seek to delay decisions still further.This has prompted speculation that a transition period could be extended, in part to allow more time for a new customs arrangement. On Thursday, Nick Timothy, May’s former joint chief of staff, argued that this could happen, an idea immediately rejected by Downing Street.The further delays on Brexit legislation reinforces the belief that ministers hope to avoid any Commons defeats by putting off any big decisions by MPs until the government has finalised its strategy for exiting the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a492aebf1a6dcb0f721373a5c82bb0757d42812/0_32_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7870e6213967c4a4514cf8a770d11987","title":"the answer to life the universe and everything might be 73 or 67","story":"A new estimate of the Hubble constant – the rate at which the universe is expanding – is baffling many of the finest minds in the cosmology community The latest, most precise, estimate of the universe’s current rate of expansion - a value known as the Hubble constant - comes from observations by the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which is conducting the most detailed ever three-dimensional survey of the Milky Way.The data has allowed the rate of expansion to be pinned down to a supposed accuracy of a couple of percent. However, this newest estimate stands in stark contradiction with an independent measure of the Hubble constant based on observations of ancient light that was released shortly after the Big Bang. In short, the universe is getting bigger quicker than it should be.The mismatch is significant and problematic because the Hubble constant is widely regarded as the most fundamental number in cosmology. “The fact the universe is expanding is really one of the most powerful ways we have to determine the composition of the universe, the age of the universe and the fate of the universe,” said Professor Adam Riess, at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, who led the latest analysis. “The Hubble constant quantifies all that into one number.”In an expanding universe, the further away a star or galaxy is, the quicker it is receding. Hubble’s constant – proposed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s – reveals by how much. So one approach to measuring it is by observing the redshifts of bright supernovae, whose light is stretched as the very space it is travelling through expands. A challenge, though, is pinpointing the exact distance of these stars.Riess, who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, is part of a team focussed on developing ultra-precise methods for measuring distances. The latest Gaia observations have advanced this effort by identifying dozens of new Cepheid stars, which have the special feature that their light flickers at a rate that is directly linked to their brightness at source. So through observing the pulsations of these so-called standard candles, scientists can work out their original luminosity and, therefore, how far away they and their native galaxies are.The new data puts the Hubble constant at 73, which translates to galaxies moving away from us 73km per second faster for each additional megaparsec of distance between us and them (a megaparsec is about 3.3m light-years).However, a separate estimate of Hubble comes from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, relic radiation that allows scientists to calculate how quickly the universe was expanding 300,000 years after the big bang. “The cosmic microwave background is the light that is the furthest away from us that we can see,” said Riess. “It’s been travelling for 13.7bn years... and it’s telling us how fast the universe was expanding when the universe was a baby.”Scientists then use the cosmic equivalent of a child growth chart (a computational model that roughly describes the age and contents of the universe and the laws of physics) to predict how fast the universe should be expanding today. This gives a Hubble value of 67.Until recently, scientists had hoped that as measurements became more precise, this mismatch would narrow, but instead the difference has widened and the latest calculation gives a chance of only 1 in 7,000 of the discrepancy being down to chance. “If this continues to hold up we may be dealing with what we call new physics of the universe,” said Riess.What form might this take? One proposal is that dark energy, believed to be accelerating the expansion of the universe, is becoming more potent. Scientists are not sure why this would happen - since space is being stretched out, one might expect its strength to be diluted instead. Another possibility is that a fourth, not yet observed, variety of neutrino could have skewed calculations. Dark matter could also be to blame if it turns out to interact more with normal matter than current models predict.“I’m not in the business of ensuring that everything fits,” said Riess. “I think: ‘Ah this is very interesting’.”More prosaic explanations have also been put forward. John Peacock, professor of cosmology at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Beyond a certain level of complexity you have to be open to the possibility that there may be little assumptions that might not be quite right.”The crisis in cosmology, as it was described a meeting of the American Physical Society last month, could soon be resolved through new measurements of the Hubble constant based on gravitational wave observations by the Ligo collaboration. “Within the next five years, we’ll probably nail this,” said Peacock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0f0a0b7f7b6c7963259adc0c3c658efd0b60d49/0_223_5594_3357/master/5594.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fea0d55fb50666f10f2f07c1b0530b05","title":"danny cipriani back in for england amid brad shields call up controversy","story":"Eddie Jones has warned Danny Cipriani he will be sent home from South Africa if he steps out of line after the fly-half received a first senior England call-up for three years.Cipriani’s return to the international fold is the most notable selection in Jones’s 34-man squad for the three‑Test series next month and while the message from Jones was clear, the mercurial fly‑half will also be given every chance to stake a claim for the England No 10 shirt. “If he’s a good character he could be in the team for a long time,” the head coach said. “If he’s a bad character, there’s always a plane back from Johannesburg.”Jones has also called up the Hurricanes flanker Brad Shields, who has been granted “special exemption” by New Zealand Rugby. Hours before Jones named Shields as one of eight uncapped members of his squad, NZR revealed it would be reluctantly letting him join the England touring party in South Africa.NZR went on to state it was “extremely disappointed” by the Rugby Football Union’s pursuit of someone who has not yet played in England, later adding: “It seems highly unusual that they can’t find players within their own country to pick.”The New Zealand‑born Shields is joining Wasps next season and England have always maintained they considered him available in accordance with World Rugby regulations but it is understood the two unions have been in discussions after the player lodged a request for release with NZR.Jones brushed off the criticism, referencing Shields’s eligibility through his parents and how, as revealed by the  last month, the RFU considers him available because of his forthcoming move to Wasps, even though he is due to play up to six Hurricanes matches after the tour.“New Zealand are quite entitled to say what they want to say and I’m quite entitled to pick England-qualified players,” Jones said. “My job is actually that, to pick England-qualified players. I’ll keep doing the job I’m paid to do. I get a list and I pick the best out of that list. I don’t decide the regulations.”Jones also revealed Shields may not be ready for the first Test at Ellis Park on 9 June – he is due to play for the Hurricanes in Dunedin eight days earlier – and denied he is losing face by picking a player deemed not good enough for a New Zealand cap.Jones’s decision to select Cipriani in his senior squad for the first time – he played for the Saxons in 2016 – can be considered a major U-turn by the head coach. Cipriani’s last cap came in a 2015 World Cup warm-up match against France – he last started in 2008 – and Jones has hitherto ignored the 30-year-old, previously questioning his suitability to playing second fiddle in his squad.“I’ve watched him play closely and he deserves an opportunity,” said Jones, who also views Cipriani as an option at full-back. “He’s done some things I’ve asked him to do in games and I’m happy to give him the opportunity. I’ve been looking at it purely from a rugby point of view, what he can add and what he can do. I’m convinced there is something he can offer because he’s made changes to his game.“The baggage doesn’t worry me. It’s how he behaves in front of me. I can’t control what he’s done in the past. All I can do is control what he does in the future so it’s how he comes in, how he reacts. And also give him that flexibility to display his talent. He’s definitely got a creative talent and we don’t want to annul that, but he has to understand that there is a team and he has to play within that team.”Jones did, however, claim that “selfishness” was one of the major obstacles he has encountered with English players, conceding Dylan Hartley’s leadership will be missed against the Springboks. Hartley is among the list of 20 players either injured or rested, with Owen Farrell taking over the captaincy.“In English rugby in particular the key for the captain is to get unity because it is a sporting environment here that is based around selfishness. It is about the inidual gain,” Jones said. “Dylan has been absolutely outstanding at getting the team to work together.“It is definitely a key issue. Just look at the commercial opportunities here compared to other countries, it is much greater. It is something we are continually battling. We have been on top of it. Maybe we are not on top of it now. It is a constant issue for us as a team.”Meanwhile, Scott Wisemantel has been announced as England’s attack coach for the tour of South Africa. The 48-year-old, recently employed as Montpellier’s backs coach, has worked with Jones before with Japan and Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4128e351ce3d9b6f3cc4f44eb45d7abfe7b11391/0_100_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fbd19dcd9111edec3956dd43f1cd86","title":"ireland pakistan first test match","story":"The day before the start of play they were still putting the finishing touches to Test cricket’s newest venue, the modest, pretty little ground at Malahide. So over the top of the pick-pack-pock-puck of the practising batsmen there was the sound of workmen hammering and drilling, fixing loudspeakers on the scaffold grandstands and new hoardings around the impermanent pavilion. Down the road a man was putting a fresh coat of paint on the railings by the station. The Irish have been waiting, working, a long time for this first Test match and want everything to go just so.“It’s been quite a while building up to this since it was announced,” said Ireland’s captain, William Porterfield. “I am sure there will be a lot of different emotions that will flow through everyone in the next 24 hours.” Mainly excitement, he said, but some anxiety, too. The pitch is green, the forecast awful and Pakistan have a formidable attack. Ireland aren’t short of first-class experience – they’ve more of that than this callow Pakistan side – but Boyd Rankin is the only man among them who has ever played a Test.So even Porterfield, 33, and Ed Joyce, 39, aren’t quite sure how they will handle it all. The team had a long chat with Marcus Trescothick after their warm-up match against Somerset to get a better idea about what to expect. “He talked about the experience of playing Test cricket and how the standard is just that little higher than county cricket, how it’s more relentless,” Porterfield said. It was nothing they had not heard before from their coach, Graham Ford, but Porterfield still found it reassuring.The captain and his team are acutely aware that they are not just representing themselves, but all the Irish cricketers before them, the men who never had the chance to play a Test. “It would be remiss if we didn’t talk about everything that has gone before us. Not only over the last five or 10 years, which everyone remembers, but about every cricketer who has ever played for Ireland. On and off the pitch, administrators and a lot of people have devoted a lot of their lives to make this happen.”Cricket has a long history in Ireland. There were playing in Phoenix Park back in 1730, and by 1860 it had become one of the most popular sports in the country. There were around 300 clubs in Ireland at that point and the national team waswere strong enough to beat MCC by an innings at Lord’s in 1858. Everything started to change when the Gaelic Athletic Association was formed in 1884, and then, at the turn of the 20th century, banned GAA members from playing or attending foreign sports.Back then, there wasn’t an Irish Cricket Union to protect or promote the sport. As a result the game, so strongly associated with England, dwindled in popularity. It became a minority sport, played in patches of Northern Ireland and middle-class areas of Dublin and Cork. The national team played annual matches against Scotland and tour games against counties and countries. They won some famous victories, against South Africa in 1904, West Indies in 1928 and 1969. But they were seen as beer matches.Even in the 1990s, when Cricket Ireland finally appointed their first full-time coach, Mike Hendrick, the game was an amateur affair, and often as not the players would have to covering their own costs. When Adrian Birrell took over as coach in 2002, he was told the boot of his company car was supposed to double up as a storeroom for the team’s kit. When Warren Deutrom became the chief executive in 2006, he was the board’s only full-time member of staff, with a part-time PA who worked four mornings a week.It is fitting that Pakistan are their opponents in this first Test, since they were the team Ireland beat in their breakthrough game, on St Patrick’s Day at the 2007 World Cup, a three-wicket victory that put them on the front pages and to the forefront of associate cricket. After that, Deutrom pushed through the modernisation of the sport. The first professional contracts followed in 2009, an interprovincial domestic competition was launched in 2013 and now, 11 years after that win in Jamaica, they are at last being allowed to play Test cricket.Porterfield played in that famous match in 2007. “It’s obviously been a long journey,” he said, “but in some ways a pretty quick journey as well.”When Porterfield started, Ireland did not even have ODI status, “now tomorrow we’re going out there and playing the first Test match for Ireland”. Along the way there has been, he said, “a long banging of the drum”. And now it’s done, there’s excitement, anxiety, and more than either of those, the gratitude. “It just culminates with us being lucky enough at the time of our careers to be able to take the pitch to play that first Test match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8dc32016ac6377586525c736b75070d09a395a7/0_281_4743_2846/master/4743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0e68fc24e7f51b65a3a3ca65520702f","title":"lewis hamilton zero comfortability f1 mercedes","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes he is not in a position to fight competitively for the world championship despite holding a four-point lead over his key rival, Sebastian Vettel.Preparing for the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend the Mercedes driver also criticised Formula One management for failing to consider drivers’ opinions in designing new circuits after he was disappointed by the layout for the new race in Miami next year, which was given official approval on Thursday.Hamilton took the championship lead after he inherited a win at the last round in Baku when his team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, went out with a puncture in the dying laps. It was his first victory of a season during which his team have struggled to optimise his car and tyre performance at every meeting except Australia.“I have zero comfortability. Since the last race I have not thought for one second that I am leading the world championship,” Hamilton said. “There is a long way to go. Imagine if I got excited now knowing that we still have all the problems. It doesn’t mean anything. What is important is where you are in the end.“If this weekend we happen to get on top of the issues we have with the car and start to be more consistent then I will be a lot happier because I know then I can punch either at my weight or a little bit above, but at the moment I am punching below my weight and that is not sufficient to win a world championship. We have been capitalising on circumstances like the outcome of the last race, so I will take it for now but in the long term the team cannot rely on that.”Hamilton had previously posted on social media criticising the Miami track and went further in Barcelona. “I don’t get why great golfers design golf courses but I don’t think any of the top racing drivers have ever designed a race track,” he said. “Miami is a super-cool place and I was very exited to hear about it but then I saw the layout and my reaction was: ‘Nah.’“I dread the thought of a street circuit we had like Valencia, which wasn’t great. It can be very hit and miss but maybe it will be a hit. If there is time and anyone wants to approach me or any other drivers, I am sure we can give some good insight into what the layout is like and how it could be better. I know Miami quite well and there are some better locations to put the track.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b3096ded4ec3bac8a843e62bec12e37d5005bc1/0_1182_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78f8f2559988e080f20a5213a7526f81","title":"eight years after it finished why is lost being reappraised","story":"Podcasters are obsessed with it, as are gamers, and Reddit won’t stop digging into it. So what is it about Lost that people still can’t get enough of?Eight years after one of the most isive finales in television history, it feels like Lost is on the rise again. Listen hard enough and you’ll hear the sound of it being rediscovered.It’s bubbling up all over the place. New blogs and podcasts and Reddit discussions concerning themselves with various aspects of Lost have started to appear without warning. Gamers, too, seem to have suddenly rediscovered the series. This week alone, for instance, a Fortnite user found a hatch in the woods, prompting speculation of a Lost crossover, and a Far Cry 5 user recreated the Lost island in its entirety using the game’s map editor.Meanwhile, in entertainment, you can feel Lost’s influence everywhere. It’s in the knotty time structure of This Is Us. It’s in the spectacularly high concept of The Good Place, to the point that Mike Schur literally consulted Lost’s Damon Lindelof when he started to write it. It’s in the marketing push for Amazon’s The Crossing – billed as being “from the network that brought you Lost” – even though it is certainly no Lost. And if rumours are to be believed, Avengers 4 (a film all but guaranteed to be the most successful ever) is going to be heavily inspired by Lost’s fourth series.But why now? Why have I, an ardent Lost apologist since the word go, had to wait eight long and lonely years before the rest of the world caught up with me?“I took a long time to come around,” says Jack Shepherd, who co-hosts The Lost Boys podcast. The podcast’s gimmick is that Jack watches Lost for the first time, along with his die-hard fan Jacob, before discussing it. Jack dodged Lost for so long partly thanks to its weird reputation. “My older brother watched the first few seasons and gave up because he thought it quickly became awful. Most friends never made it through season five. The length of the show – 100 episodes plus – is also daunting, especially when I’ve been told there’s a lot of filler”.He has a point. Lost was never really interested in hanging around for viewers. If you missed a couple of episodes, the whole thing had a habit of making no sense whatsoever. Once, during the original run, I was discussing an episode with a friend – this was in the show’s loosey-goosey endgame, with various dimensions and donkey wheels and pendulums at play – and we had to stop because strangers were looking at us as if we were concussed.It’s also worth mentioning The Leftovers, Damon Lindelof’s Lost follow-up. Although not as highly watched as Lost – it was too bleak and weird for mainstream appeal – The Leftovers managed to win over an army of frothing devotees. It felt like a Lost concentrate, a similarly high-concept programme that didn’t feel the need to pander to a network television audience with 22-episode runs or episodes about tattoo origins. Better yet, it stuck the landing. The finale of The Leftovers is a genuinely breathtaking, emotionally satisfying piece of work that fed back into the original premise in a way that Lost couldn’t. After watching The Leftovers go out on such a soaring high point, and after just 28 episodes, of course you’d go back and give Lost a second chance. It doesn’t seem coincidental that this new rush of Lost interest has only surged now that The Leftovers is over.Both Jack and Jacob agree that we’ll never see the likes of Lost again. But that’s fine. We can live with Lost because it is everywhere now. Whenever we see Redditors sweat out elaborate Westworld theories, it’s because of Lost. Whenever we see deep-e online recaps, it’s because of Lost. Shorter, more compressed series? That’s because of Lost. Whenever there’s a flashback, or a flashforward, or a terrible Britpop band named after a mechanical component, it’s because of Lost. Lost will never die. Finally, the believers have been vindicated.

Belhaj has neither sought, nor received, a financial settlement. Boudchar and their 13-year-old son Abderrahim travelled to London and watched from the public gallery as Wright told MPs that, after mediation, the government had reached a full and final settlement with the couple, who had withdrawn their legal claim.In her letter, May admitted the UK should have done more to reduce the risk that the couple could be mistreated, and had wrongly missed opportunities to help them once they were held in the prisons of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi.She acknowledged that Britain should have realised sooner that its allies were involved in unacceptable practices, implying criticism of Libya for torture and the CIA’s practice of rendition.Downing Street confirmed that parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) would have full access to all government papers on the Belhaj case for the first time for its inquiry into rendition, which is expected to report later this year. In her letter, which was handed to Belhaj in person by the British ambassador in Istanbul, May said: “It is clear that you were both subjected to appalling treatment and that you suffered greatly, not least the affront to the dignity of Mrs Boudchar who was pregnant at the time.“The UK government believes your accounts. Neither of you should have been treated in this way. The UK government’s actions contributed to your detention, rendition and suffering. “… On behalf of Her Majesty’s government I apologise unreservedly. We are profoundly sorry for the ordeal that you both suffered and our role in it. The UK government has learned many lessons from this period.”The couple have fought for compensation and an apology for more than six years after papers came to light during the Libyan revolution that revealed the role played by British intelligence officers in their kidnapping.They were seized in Thailand in 2004 before being hooded, shackled and flown to one of Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death. He was released six years later. Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant when she was abducted. She was released shortly before giving birth.Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u0026nbspand his wife, Fatima Boudchar,\u0026nbspwere the victims of a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of\u0026nbspMI6.They have battled for compensation and an apology for more than six years, after papers that came to light during the Libyan revolution revealed the role that British intelligence officers played in their 2004 kidnap in Thailand.The couple were hooded and shackled and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi’s prisons, where Belhaj was tortured and sentenced to death.They had sued the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspAmong the evidence obtained by Scotland Yard was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts.Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya,\u0026nbspTony Blair paid his first visit\u0026nbspto the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”.\u0026nbspOther documents discovered during the Libyan revolution\u0026nbspmake clear that information extracted from Belhaj was used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.After receiving the letter, Belhaj told the : “The wording of the apology was heartfelt. There was a feeling of concern, an admission of the shortcomings, an expression of unreserved apology, lessons learned, admission of failings and an expression of disappointment towards the international partners that I was handed over to. “All of these sentiments that came through in the apology, I welcome them. This is in spite of my belief that the length of time is part of the suffering. That is because you feel that you suffered and endured and were wronged, and then you have to wait for years. But what matters is the result in the end.” He said the responses of MPs was like a balm, and he felt some realised the need for laws to prevent it happening again.“From the very first moment, I insisted that there must be an apology. I never asked for monetary compensation because I don’t want to impose on the taxpayers, and so I can put a quick end to this suffering, but what led us to the courts is the rejection of the demand for an apology. I welcome this step, the acceptance of the apology condition, and I hope this is not repeated with someone else.” Boudchar said after the attorney general’s statement: “I thank the British government for its apology and for inviting me and my son to the UK to hear it. I accept the government’s apology.”Wright told MPs: “There remains a considerable international threat to the UK and our allies and it is important that government and the security and intelligence agencies are able to respond properly so we can keep our country safe.“But it is also important that we should act in line with our values and in accordance with the rule of law. That means that when we get things wrong it is right and just that we should acknowledge it, compensate those affected and learn lessons. I believe this is such a case.”By the beginning of last year, the government had spent £750,000 defending the claim. Wright said no admission of liability had been made by any defendants, which include the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the government. Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time of the rendition operations, told MPs in 2005 that suggestions the UK was involved in such abuses were “conspiracy theories” and there was no truth in the claims.When documents emerged during the 2011 Libyan revolution showing MI6 had been involved in the kidnap of two of Gaddafi’s opponents, their wives and children, Straw insisted he had not been involved in any wrongdoing. Allen has also maintained his innocence.In a statement issued on Thursday, Straw said he had been responsible for authorising actions to protect national security, including sharing information with foreign governments. Usually, he said, requests such as those for rendition were put in writing and agreed in writing. On this occasion, he had given oral approval, which was permitted in rare cases of great urgency. “I took these responsibilities very seriously. As I have said on many occasions I sought to act at all times in a manner which was fully consistent with my legal duties, and with national and international law.” Tony Blair was criticised in the Commons for his government’s role in rendition, with Joanna Cherry, the SNP’s justice spokeswoman, asking whether the case revealed part of the “dark side” of his deal in the desert with Gaddafi in 2004, and the Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh calling on him to apologise. Ken Clarke, the Conservative chairman of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition, said: “Given the fulsome nature of the apology, the question has to be asked why it has taken the government so long to settle this matter, particularly when Mr Belhaj offered to settle the case in 2013 for £3 and an apology? The delay is deeply regrettable.”Fellow Tory Andrew Mitchell called for the UK government to pass on details of the Belhaj apology to US officials examining the conduct of Gina Haspel, who is expected to be confirmed as the next director of the CIA. David Cameron announced in 2010 that there would be an independent inquiry into allegations of UK involvement in rendition and torture. A damning report was quietly published three years later, just as a jury was reaching its verdict in the Lee Rigby trial. Ministers then handed responsibility for the questions the judge-led inquiry had been unable to answer to the ISC.Sapna Malik, from the law firm Leigh Day which represented Belhaj and Bouchar, said: “Today’s candid apology from the government helps restore the humanity and dignity so brutally denied to my clients during their ordeal, and is warmly welcomed.”Cori Crider, the lawyer representing the Belhaj family on behalf of the human rights organisation Reprieve, said the extent of the government’s apology was unprecedented. “It’s broader and deeper and more sincere than any apology we have seen from the war on terror,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49042532ffb5ff09a546066cb10d6def912d871d/0_152_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbfa0488ee07ff3bdd908b3520496a2d","title":"libyan rendition how uks role in kidnap of two families unravelled","story":"In 2005, Jack Straw told MPs reports of the rendition of two Libyan families were ‘conspiracy theories’The fires of Libya’s revolution were still burning when, in September 2011, a handful of militiamen and human rights activists made an extraordinary discovery in an outpost of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s main intelligence agency, the External Security Organisation (ESO).On shelves around the walls of one office, inside one folder after another, were hundreds of pages of secret communications between the ESO, the CIA and MI6, and between Gaddafi and Tony Blair.These papers showed beyond doubt that all three agencies had been involved in the kidnap and torture of two of Gaddafi’s opponents, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi. Moreover, they had also been involved in the kidnap and severe mistreatment of the men’s wives, Fatima Boudchar and Karima al-Saadi, and Saadi’s four children, the youngest aged six. Boudchar was four and a half months pregnant when she was kidnapped.The two families had been abducted in Bangkok and Hong Kong and flown to Tripoli in separate “rendition” operations 17 days apart, in March 2004. In between, Blair had paid his first visit to Tripoli, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that they were making “common cause” against al-Qaida and terrorism.These documents nailed as a lie the mantra that British government officials repeated whenever allegations of involvement in post-911 human rights abuses were raised: that the government did not “participate in, solicit, encourage or condone” the use of torture. Three years after the two rendition operations – and six years before the discovery of the secret files in Tripoli – Jack Straw, then foreign secretary, told MPs that media reports about the abuses were “conspiracy theories”, and that “there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition”.The discovery in the ESO’s outpost put a stop to such denials. They showed that MI6 had provided the intelligence that allowed the CIA to abduct Belhaj and Saadi, the two leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The LIFG was an Islamist militia that had rejected al-Qaida’s global agenda, focusing instead on the overthrow of Gaddafi, and had been something of an ally of the UK until the 911 attacks in New York turned the global geopolitical order upside down.Copies of the Tripoli papers were handed to two London law firms, and claims brought against not only the foreign office and MI6, but also against Straw and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6.The government announced that the Libyan renditions would be among the cases investigated by the Gibson inquiry, established the previous year to examine allegations of UK’s involvement in human rights abuses during counter-terrorism operations.A few months later, Scotland Yard announced it too was investigating MI6’s involvement in the rendition operations. At this point, the government shelved the Gibson inquiry, maintaining that it could not continue its work while a police investigation was under way. Instead, the intelligence and security committee, a group of MPs and peers said to provide oversight of the intelligence agencies, would examine the matter. The committee is yet to report.It was clear from the outset that the main suspect in the police inquiry would be Allen, whose name appeared on a number of the letters that had been faxed to Gaddafi’s head of intelligence, Moussa Koussa.Notoriously, Allen had sent a fax in which he congratulated Koussa on the “safe arrival” of Belhaj. “This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.” He added that “amusingly”, the CIA – which had provided the aircraft for one of the rendition operations – had asked that MI6 channel all requests for information from Belhaj through them.“I have no intention of doing any such thing,” he said. “The intelligence … was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this.”Boudchar gave an interview to the  in which she explained how that air cargo’s safe arrival was achieved. She and her husband had been taken off a flight in Bangkok and led to a detention centre somewhere within the airport. While her husband was being tortured, she was hooded and chained to a wall for five days, given water, but starved.Her captors were three masked Americans, two men and a woman. “They knew I was pregnant,” she said. “It was obvious.” She was forced to lie on a stretcher before the flight to Tripoli, and bound, head to foot, with sticky tape. “My left eye was closed when the tape was applied, but my right eye was open. It was agony.”The flight took 17 hours. Throughout the journey, Boudchar could hear her husband grunting in pain: he had been shackled in a way that ensured he could neither lie nor sit. On landing they were driven separately to prison. Belhaj says the torture began immediately. Boudchar was freed shortly before giving birth.Saadi’s eldest daughter, Khadija, told the  how her family had also been forced on to an aircraft. She was 12 years old at the time. She and her brothers, Mostapha, 11, and Anes, nine, and her sister, Arowa, six, were told not to speak to each other.“My mother was crying. She told me they were taking us to Libya. I was very scared. I thought my mother and father were going to be tortured and we would all be killed. I was told to say goodbye to my father. He was handcuffed to a seat in another compartment and had a drip in his arm. One of the Libyan intelligence officers was laughing at me.”Khadija, her mother, and her siblings were held for two and a half months. Belhaj and Saadi were detained for six years, and say they were repeatedly tortured. They were also asked a series of questions that both MI6 and MI5 drew up and handed over to the ESO. There were more than 1,600 of these questions: these too were part of the serendipitous discovery at the abandoned ESO outpost.British intelligence officers also interrogated the men in person. Left alone on one occasion with his British questioners, Belhaj says he conveyed through sign language that he was being suspended by his arms and beaten. The British clearly understood, he says: one gave a thumbs-up sign, while the other nodded her head.Analysis of the Tripoli papers shows that the rendition operations were just part of the rapprochement between London and Tripoli, which appears to have been a complex affair driven more by intelligence officers than diplomats. There were efforts also to persuade Gaddafi to abandon his nuclear and chemical weapons ambitions, as well as oil and gas exploration deals, trade agreements and personal relationships.Among the files was a letter from Blair to Gaddafi – “Dear Muammar”, it began – thanking him for their countries’ intelligence officers’ “excellent cooperation” and expressing regret that the English courts had again declined to deport a member of the LIFG. The Tripoli papers show that some of the questions that had been handed to the Libyans were intended to elicit information that could justify the detention and attempted deportation of LIFG members who had resided peacefully in the UK for many years. Despite the wealth of documentary evidence of UK involvement in these abuses, the government resisted the claim brought by Belhaj and Boudchar. By the beginning of last year, the government had spent £750,000 defending it, including £110,000 defending Allen and £26,500 defending Straw.It appears ministers and government lawyers resisted the claims not because they were reluctant to make payments – Saadi settled for £2.2m in 2012 – but because they did not wish to apologise. Belhaj made clear that he did not want money – and has not received any – but he did want an apology, especially for his wife.That was difficult as long as the police investigation was under way: if the government admitted liability, it was difficult to see how someone would not be charged with a criminal offence. Doubtless this was an appalling vista in the minds of many in Whitehall.When the Crown Prosecution Service decided against prosecuting Allen – much to the anger of some detectives on the case – Belhaj’s lawyers sought a judicial review of the decision, and so an apology remained unthinkable.Thursday’s settlement included an agreement that the bid for a judicial review would be abandoned: the path was finally clear for an apology and a settlement of the long-running case. But did the secret collaboration between MI6 and ESO bear fruit?On the one hand, some involved in the rendition operations claim they were part of a process that led to Gaddafi abandoning his WMD programme – although he actually did that three months earlier.On the other hand, one of the documents discovered in Tripoli was an MI5 assessment of the LIFG, written 10 months after the two families had been abducted. Marked “Secret, UKLibya Eyes Only”, the report concluded candidly that while the detention of the two men had cast the LIFG into disarray, it had also pushed it closer to al-Qaida and its pan-Islamist, anti-western agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb5ba89d55f368786cd2c8e4948eceb8518d869/0_14_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76301956837a6940f59fe5a4d7ca64bb","title":"us issues apology after canadian minister told to take off turban at airport","story":"Navdeep Bains, a cabinet minister, said he refused to take off his turban after he had already passed through regular security checksOfficials from the Trump administration issued an apology after a security agent at a Detroit airport repeatedly demanded that a Canadian cabinet minister remove his turban, the minister has revealed. Navdeep Bains, the country’s minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, described the incident in an interview with the French-language paper La Presse on Thursday.Bains was returning to Toronto after meetings with Michigan state leaders in April 2017 and had already passed through regular security checks, but because he was wearing a turban, a security agent told him that he would have to undergo additional checks, according to La Presse. “He told me to take off my turban. I asked him why I would have to take off my turban when the metal detector had worked properly,” the minister said. The US amended its travel policy in 2007, allowing Sikhs to keep turbans on while passing during the security inspection process.He refused the agent’s request to remove his turban: “I believed that it was an intrusion into my private life … They would never ask me to take off my clothes,” he said. The agent eventually relented. Bains said that when he travels, he rarely discloses his identity as a cabinet minister, in order to better understand the travel experiences – and frustrations – of people not afforded similar privileges. When he appeared at his scheduled gate, a second security agent approached him, requesting Bains return to the security checkpoint – and again telling him to remove his head-covering.“He told me: ‘You have to take off your turban.’ I responded politely that it was not a security threat and that I had passed all the security controls. Then he asked for my name and identification. I reluctantly gave him my diplomatic passport.”It was the moments that followed which most incensed Bains. “I was speechless … I was at the point of boarding and they asked me to take off my turban. But upon learning of my diplomatic status, they told me that everything is fine. That’s not a satisfactory response.”The incident prompted foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland to express disappointment to her US counterparts. Both undersecretaries for the homeland security and transportation departments apologized for the incident. Canada has more Sikh ministers than any other country in the world. In the 2015 election, 20 Sikhs were elected members of parliament and four – Bains, Harjit Sajjan, Amarjeet Sohi and Bardish Chagger – were appointed as federal ministers. “Unfortunately these types of incidents do occur from time to time to minorities in particular. But it should never become the norm,” Bains said in a statement. “I will continue to promote ersity and inclusion across the country as our government has done since we took office. It is exactly why I ran for office.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f40a084a529c378868ac82dd7ca2f1789262f1/0_132_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f47ea35a41ada3a9407ba3d708f3d5e7","title":"brazil lula guilherme boulos youngest president","story":"Guilherme Boulos, only 35, has a slim chance in the October election, but he’s already seen as a potential successor – by Lula himselfIt sounds like the longest of long shots. Guilherme Boulos has never stood for political office of any kind, but he is somehow now aiming for the very top job. “Clearly, it’s a David v Goliath battle,” the 35-year-old social activist admits of his unlikely quest to become Brazil’s youngest ever president. “But it’s something that we must face.”Polls leave no doubt that Boulos – who is running alongside indigenous activist Sônia Guajajara for the leftist Socialism and Liberty party – has a wafer-thin chance of achieving his goal when Latin America’s biggest democracy votes on 7 October. In the longer term, however, the São Paulo-born politician’s prospects look far brighter. As Brazil’s crisis-stricken left comes to terms with the sidelining of its torchbearer, former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Boulos is being touted as a potential successor – not least by Lula himself.In his last public speech before being jailed last month, Lula clutched Boulos’s hand and urged supporters to take note of this “companheiro of the highest quality”. Turning to Boulos next to him on stage, Lula added: “You’ve got a bright future, brother, just don’t ever give up.”Lula made no fewer than five allusions to the activist during that parting address, Piauí magazine noted in a recent profile proclaiming Boulos “o herdeiro” or “the heir”: “Nobody was mentioned or praised as much.”Boulos, who shares Lula’s eventually relinquished love of smoking and the Corinthians football club as well as his legendary charisma, has downplayed that nickname, while recognising parallels between his 16-year struggle for social justice with the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST) and Lula’s championing of the poor. “Only the dead have heirs,” Boulos said during a high-profile television interview this week.But that widely applauded TV appearance only intensified chatter over Boulos’s status as Lula’s inheritor. In an article headlined “The Star is Born”, political journalist Luis Nassif celebrated “the birth of a national leader”. Leonardo Boff, a leftist theologian and longtime Lula confidant, seconded the emotion, tweeting: “You are a new leadership in Brazil.” During a recent interview with the  – conducted while clattering around Rio in the back of a silver Honda compact – Boulos spoke of his desire to lead a long-term renewal of Brazil’s left, a movement at a crossroads after losing its leader of nearly four decades. He insisted his presidential bid was a genuine attempt to gain power and hoped the anti-systemic frustrations rippling across the globe might boost his campaign. “People are tired of the the same old marketing tricks. People no longer have faith in the old ways of doing politics. This opens up an possibility,” said Boulos. “This is an election in which anything is possible.”Boulos said combating “pornographic” levels of inequality would be his priority as president. “Brazil is the world’s seventh biggest economy and yet also one of the 10 most unequal,” he said as his car sped past Jacarezinho, a vast redbrick favela, on its way to the family home of murdered Rio councillor Marielle Franco. “Brazil isn’t just one country,” Boulos added that afternoon. “Brazil is a fissure. Brazil is an abyss.”On the campaign trail, Boulos, who holds a master’s in psychiatry from one of Brazil’s top universities, has been doing plenty of that. After spending the morning with Franco’s sister and parents, he set off for a round table discussion with leftwing artists and activists who served up a bewildering smorgasbord of demands.One called for academic quotas for Brazil’s transgender community another demanded action against tyrannical media oligopolies a third protested that the swimming pool of a local state school had become a dumping site for old sofas and dead dogs.“We must roll up our sleeves, hang our pants on the washing line and demand from the government what is ours!” a fourth petitioner bellowed to furrowed brows and giggles.Throughout the meandering session Boulos sat attentively taking notes before ending with a brief but rousing address delivered in a silky baritone not unlike that of his incarcerated political patron.The would-be president railed against corruption, racism, gender discrimination, the “stupid” war on drugs and the failings of Brazil’s inward-looking left which spent too much time “preaching to the converted”.“We’re in a moment of transition. We’re entering a new cycle,” intoned Boulos, whose purple T-shirt carried the words of the German playwright Bertolt Brecht: “Nothing should seem impossible to change.” When Lula’s increasingly apparent heir concluded he was cheered off the stage and mobbed for selfies. Back in his Honda and heading to Rio’s airport, Boulos said his travels around Brazil had convinced him the country needed a leader capable of hearing “the clamour of the people”. “Perhaps one of the characteristics of our failed political system is that it is deaf … Politics is full of people who can come out and make big speeches … but someone who wants to govern a country must really know that country and listening is essential to knowing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d79be7938d73b8ab2476095d91f458c1400f09a8/0_176_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc8f60f631f45a175a90450861238477","title":"friday briefing may turns brexit into role reversal game","story":"Leavers and remainers workshop each other’s customs plans … alert over unsafe seatbelts … and man pulls off huge scam with change-of-address formLeavers and remainers workshop each other’s customs plans … alert over unsafe seatbelts … and man pulls off huge scam with change-of-address formHello, I’m Warren Murray, welcome to Friday’s news.Theresa May has ordered Brexiters to study her “customs partnership” model, and remainers to go over the leavers’ “maximum facilitation” proposal, in a bid to thrash out a compromise between the two sides. Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond – apparently regarded as the “ultras” of leave and remain, respectively – have been sitting out of the cabinet working groups.May’s “customs partnership” will be examined by Brexiters Liam Fox and Michael Gove, teamed with remainer and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington. “Max-fac” will be workshopped by remainers Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, along with Brexit secretary David Davis, a leaver.The ministers have until Tuesday to examine their options, but entrenched positions mean a breakthrough is not expected. One cabinet minister told the  it is partly about May wanting to “kick any decisions down the road for as long as she can”. It certainly looks that way, after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, announced government business for the next fortnight – minus the EU withdrawal bill, which needs to come back from the Lords but is peppered with amendments that have enraged Brexiters. Labour accused the government of “subverting democracy” with the delay.Sir John Major, meanwhile, has hit out at Brexiters’ failure to grasp that leaving the customs union would mean a hard border in Ireland and damaging consequences for peace there. The Conservative former PM, speaking at the Irish embassy in London, said without a customs union, border checks would be required by law, especially for food, animals and animal feed. “If so, a physical border seems unavoidable,” he said.Seatbelt scare – Owners of the latest model Volkswagen Polo, Seat Ibiza and Seat Arona are being warned the left rear seatbelt can unlatch suddenly while the cars are being driven at speed. A Finnish motoring magazine identified the problem during testing. VW Group said it was aware of the fault and owners should not use the middle seatbelt until a recall is carried out, because it can push on the left one’s button and undo it. “A feasible technical solution has been identified … Volkswagen is now waiting for the concerned authorities’ final validation in order to implement it, both on the customers’ cars and on the future series production.”‘Victims have felt let down’ – Stalkers could be electronically tagged so their victims receive an alert message when they are nearby. The proposal has been raised as the politan police opens its groundbreaking Stalking Threat Assessment Centre. DI Lee Bernard, the head of the new centre, said victims could use an app to alert them if their stalker was approaching, giving them time to call the police. “We want to stop these people coming together,” Barnard said. Several murders have been committed by stalkers who ignored police warnings to stay away from their victims. The centre will bring police together with mental health professionals and the probation service to decide how to deal with suspects and protect victims.MeToo scandal hits Pulitzer board – The novelist Junot Díaz has stepped down as chairman of the Pulitzer prize amid claims of personal misconduct. The author, himself a Pulitzer winner, remains on the board while it investigates the allegations. Meanwhile Harvey Weinstein’s ex-wife Georgina Chapman has told of her life being ripped apart by his disgrace, saying she had been naive and unaware of his behaviour. “I had what I thought was a very happy marriage,” she said. “I have moments when I just cry for my children … It’s like, they love their dad. They love him ... I just can’t bear it for them.” In today’s long read, Moira Donegan argues that MeToo has exposed the central rift in feminism: not between generations, but between its inidualist and social sides.Special delivery – A man stole thousands of postal items by changing the address of the corporate headquarters of UPS to his own home, police in Chicago allege. Dushaun Henderson-Spruce started writing his own name on the form you can get at the post office. But then he thought better of it and just wrote down “UPS”. Postal inspectors found about 3,000 pieces of mail at the apartment, including letters for the CEO, sensitive documents and corporate cards and cheques – more than $58,000 of the latter ended up in his bank account, according to authorities. He is behind bars until the case goes to hearing (or he manages to sign himself out).Pop-up bike lanes, painted potholes, “bike parklets” and painted-on 3D speed bumps.

The events were timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Moldova joining the then kingdom of Greater Romania.A former head of a tobacco company, Filip aspires to bring Moldova into the European Union. The former Soviet territory, the poorest country in Europe, lags far its behind neighbours – including Romania, which joined the EU in 2007. Nevertheless he predicted: “We will be together with Romania in the EU.”The country that is now Moldova has been buffeted by powerful neighbours for centuries, whether Ottoman sultans or Russian tsars. Once known as Bessarabia, the territory became part of Greater Romania in 1918, but came under Soviet control in 1940.It emerged as an independent country in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since then it has been grappling with poverty, corruption and the frozen conflict in the eastern Russian-speaking enclave of Transnistria.Moldova is still torn between those seeking closer ties with Russia, such as its president, Igor Dodon, and Filip, who believes pro-European parties will prevail in parliamentary elections this autumn. “At the end of my mandate we will see that this EU road is not debatable but irreversible,” he said.The prime minister was speaking on a visit to Brussels to discuss the association agreement Moldova signed with the EU in 2014. EU officials expressed concern about Moldova’s slow progress in bringing to justice criminals who embezzled $1bn (£740m) from the country’s banks, known locally as “the theft of the century”.The EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said it was “difficult for us to understand” the delays in the investigating the crime. “It is about the credibility of the anti-corruption reforms in Moldova,” she said.The scandal brought down two former prime ministers in Filip’s party, propelling him to office in January 2016.EU officials also voiced regret that Moldova ignored warnings from Council of Europe experts that a new electoral law risked allowing wealthy businesspeople undue influence over elections. Moldova’s decision to press ahead with the law contributed to the EU freezing €100m in funds.The prime minister said the topic was closed and that he expected Moldova to meet conditions allowing it access the EU loans and grants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/895db25d0142afff11b9219e544d94cb4034537b/0_7_3059_1837/master/3059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c1fb8e488236357466bbc1c5a292a7a","title":"single women a burden on the state says japanese mp","story":"Kanji Kato criticised for telling women to have multiple children as birth rate falls to lowest level since 1899An MP from Japan’s governing party has drawn accusations of sexism after he said women should have multiple children and warned those who preferred to remain single that they would become a burden on the state later in life.Kanji Kato, a member of prime minister Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic party, told a party faction meeting that when he is asked to give speeches at wedding receptions, he encourages the bride and groom to produce “at least three children”.When he encounters young women who say they do not intend to marry, Kato, who has six children and eight grandchildren, said: “I tell them that if they don’t get married then they won’t be able to have children, and that they’ll end up in a care home paid for with the taxes of other people’s children.”His comments, reported by TBS News, come days after official data showed the number of children in Japan fell to its lowest on record. As of 1 April 2018 there were 15.53 million children aged under 15, a fall of 170,000 from the previous year, according to the internal affairs ministry.Last year about 941,000 children were born in Japan, the lowest number since records began in 1899.The country’s birthrate remains stubbornly low despite the introduction of financial and other incentives to encourage couples to have bigger families.Kato, 72, is not the first Japanese politician to suggest that women should regard producing offspring as their primary role in life.In 2007 the then health minister, Hakuo Yanagisawa, described women as “birth-giving machines” and said it was their public duty to increase the birthrate.Kato, a former vice minister at the agriculture ministry, initially said he stood by his remarks after female MPs branded them sexist. His office later issued a statement in which he retracted the comments and said he had “not intended to disrespect women”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489628.1525897181!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends lack of communication with theresa may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with British prime minister Theresa May over the past six weeks. Photograph: ReutersYves Herman Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has defended his lack of contact with the British prime minister Theresa May for the past six weeks, despite the ongoing Brexit crisis and the suspended Belfast institutions.Mr Varadkar said that he and Ms May had each other’s mobile numbers and could contact each other whenever they needed to. “Currently the focus is on negotiations in Brussels and on the various cabinet meetings that are happening in the UK to determine what its position will be on the customs union, or a customs union partnership, and how that position might evolve,” he said.A meeting “is under consideration for next week” if they are both in Sofia, Bulgaria at the same time. But “the most useful conversation is the one which will be had once the British government has decided its position on the new customs arrangement”. Until then “it is very hard to make any particular progress at the moment”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who raised the issue in the Dáil, believed it was probably the only time in the past quarter of a century that leaders on both sides went so long without speaking, particularly during such a period of crisis.He expressed concern at the lack of communication, saying that the absence of the anti-Brexit majority in the North from any major discussions “causes damage every day”.And he said it was very surprising given the threat posed by an absent Northern Executive, and by the British government’s refusal to establish consultation processes with Dublin over the suspension, that the Taoiseach had had no contact with Ms May.Mr Martin, a former minister for foreign affairs, said the British-Irish intergovernmental conference should have been convened by now and the maximum use of the Belfast Agreement was imperative.“Otherwise, elements of the agreement can fall into abeyance and that ultimately brings the agreement itself into disrepute,” he warned.His call was echoed by Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who said that while it was “no silver bullet”, a forum was needed to provide a roadmap.Green party Eamon Ryan said the lack of contact for six weeks was “remarkable” and he called on the Taoiseach to engage with the smaller parties including his own colleagues in the North. “Relying on the big two” – the DUP and Sinn Féin – “is not clever at this time”, Mr Ryan said.The Taoiseach said there was a lot of contact at official and political levels. He told Mr Ryan he welcomed forces in the North other than unionist or nationalist but said they had to have regard to parties’ mandate when organising meetings.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

Vaccines have been stockpiled, we have built research and monitoring capacity, and the Rapid Support Team of health experts stand ready to be deployed if needed.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: It’s vital the global response to this outbreak is swift. We must ensure the very best protection for the communities at risk and for the health workers working to protect lives – now and for future outbreaks.Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general, emergency preparedness and response, welcomed the UK support.“The first step in containing this outbreak is to understand the extent of transmission, ensure care for people infected, engage communities and trace contacts. The generous support from Wellcome and partners like DFID in combination with WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies is already making a difference.”A team of experts from the WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations.WHO released $1 million (£738,200) from an emergency contingency fund, has set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies. MSF, which has worked with the Congolese authorities in the past to bring Ebola outbreaks under control, has deployed a team to help with the response.Julien Raickman, MSF head of mission in DRC, said: “At the moment there is an experienced MSF team in Bikoro, made up of medics, water and sanitation experts, health promoters, logisticians and an epidemiologist. The team is working with the national authorities and other international organisations to assess the situation and to ensure that the outbreak is contained.”In December 2016, trials of an Ebola vaccine confirmed it provides a high level of protection against a strain of the deadly disease.The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba.Are we prepared for the next Ebola-scale epidemic?All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said.Ebola is one of the world\u0027s most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for bushmeat.The virus is handed on through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. After an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.It is DRC\u0027s ninth known outbreak of the disease since 1976, when it was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Crossrail 2: TfL \u0026#39levy\u0026#39 could force nearby home owners to stump up millions for projectHow tourism in Iran blossomed after the nuclear deal – and what the future holds for the fragile industryPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest news\u0026#39You upset my missus!\u0026#39: Ukip politicans swear at each other over alleged \u0026#39stripper\u0026#39 insult Juncker gives major speech in Florence as Italy\u0026#39s Eurosceptics edge closer to forming governmentUS Mother\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the campaign was won – and the woman behind it turned against her life\u0026#39s workPotholes a \u0026#39national disgrace\u0026#39 and costing drivers and insurers £1m a month, AA warnsGrammar school expansion will create up to 16,000 new places, Education Secretary revealsWhat time is the Royal wedding?

Everyone knows that none of the great challenges facing our continent can be tackled by any single member state on its own.Mr Mattarella had suggested forming a caretaker administration to break the impasse on forming Italy\u0027s government, which spurred Five Star and the League, the two parties who performed the best at the polls, into talks. On Wednesday the influential former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said he would not back such a coalition, which would have a slim majority, but would not oppose it either. His pick for prime minister was Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament, who is also speaking in Florence today, but his Forza Italia party performed worse than expected in the elections. Please review our commenting policyHow tourism in Iran blossomed after the nuclear deal – and what the future holds for the fragile industryPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest news\u0026#39You upset my missus!\u0026#39: Ukip politicans swear at each other over alleged \u0026#39stripper\u0026#39 insult US Mother\u0026#39s Day 2018: How the campaign was won – and the woman behind it turned against her life\u0026#39s workPotholes a \u0026#39national disgrace\u0026#39 and costing drivers and insurers £1m a month, AA warnsGrammar school expansion will create up to 16,000 new places, Education Secretary revealsWhat time is the Royal wedding?

The rate is significantly higher than on many unsecured personal loans available from high street banks.“As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said.“In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Half of millennials would give up right to vote to clear student loansHow to use a student loan to build a £4m travel business “Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The comments came as the Treasury Committee published the government’s response to its highly critical report on the current student loans system.The government said: “RPI has always been used for calculating interest on student loans, providing consistency over time.”It added: “The flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood, and the Office for National Statistics have delivered a substantial programme of work to improve the way they measure inflation over the last two years.“The review of post-18 education and funding will look at how students and graduates contribute to the cost of their studies, including the level, terms and duration of their contribution.“It is now for the independent panel to consider the issues raised within the terms of reference in their report to government. The government cannot prejudge the findings of the panel or outcomes of the review.”A study last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that three-quarters of students will never clear their loans and that graduates from low-income families finish their studies with the highest debt of more than £57,000 on average.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

More than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have come into existence since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, each one trying to overcome one or more of bitcoin’s flaws.Increasing interest in bitcoin over the last year has been reflected across the cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum and bitcoin cash making significant gains on bitcoin.In the past 12 months, the price of one bitcoin has risen from around $1,700 to $9,360 - an increase of 450 per cent. In the same timeframe, ethereum has seen gains of almost 1,000 per cent to reach its current value of $764, while bitcoin cash has surged from around $500 in August last year to today’s price of $1,655.The price of ethereum may still be a long way off bitcoin, however there are five-times more in circulation - meaning ethereum’s market cap is just under half that of bitcoin’s.Gadgets and tech news in picturesGadgets and tech news in picturesDesigned by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

It is still by far the best known and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space.”Bitcoin could remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency, Mr Ver conceded, but he does not believe such a scenario is likely. While its perceived limitations may see its price stagnate, the utility of bitcoin cash could see its price reach “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in the future.“It’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not,” Mr Ver said. “Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week.

The series follows Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s.It’s perhaps the archetypal image of the cult we’ve come to recognise: the followers of Rajneesh, who died in 1990, dressed in orange their leader was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities) the disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead, lost contact with their families.But cults don’t have to follow the pattern of Rajneeshpuram, as the Oregon ranch was renamed, or the bloodbaths at Jonestown or Waco, where David Koresh’s sect the Branch Davidians was raided by the FBI in 1993. More often than not, they are more mundane than that… but no less damaging.Rajneesh, also known as Osho, with his ‘Orange People’ followers (Netflix)Katy Morgan-Davies last month published a book about her experiences living in Brixton with the cult leader – and her father – Aravindan Balakrishnan, who was jailed on charges of rape and imprisonment in 2015. Morgan-Davies managed to flee the cult in 2013 after 30 years – her entire life.Cults are back in the news again, but for Ian Haworth they never went away. As the head of the UK-based Cult Information Centre, he spends his life collating information on cults, offering advice and help to those who have escaped – or wish to – and campaigns for stricter legislation to control the reach and influence of these malign groups.“I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults,” says Haworth. “That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thing.”Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, formerly known as Rosie Davies, who was kept as a prisoner by her father Aravindan Balakrishnan (PA)That interest comes in peaks and troughs, naturally, with particular focus at the moment thanks to Wild Wild Country and Morgan-Davies’ memoir. Haworth says: “I suppose the biggest peak we’ve had began on 1 January 1999, when there was a huge amount of cult activity related to the millennium, when all kinds of things were promised or predicted. Of course, mathematically, the millennium ended at the end of the year 2000, not the end of 1999, but cult leaders don’t really care about such things. They care about money, and controlling people, and power.”Born in Lancashire, the son of a farmer, Haworth emigrated to Canada in 1972 while in his twenties. By 1978 he was working as a communications consultant for a large company, and had never given a thought to cults. Aged 31, he happened to be stopped by a woman with a clipboard in a Toronto street.After fleeing a cult in 1978, Ian Haworth has dedicated his life to helping others in the same situation (Cult Information Centre)“She was very attractive and I was very single,” remembers Haworth. “When she asked me if I had time to answer a few questions for what I thought was market research, I said yes.”But after only half a dozen questions, the tone of the exchange altered. The woman told Haworth that his answers indicated he’d fit in very well with a group she was involved with, and that it would enable him to give something back to society rather than just taking. A meeting was taking place the following week and Haworth was invited along.“I turned up and there were about a hundred people there,” he says. “A woman was talking about her addiction to alcohol and drugs, and how this group had helped her. I was planning to sneak away at the end, because I’d been brought up to be polite and didn’t want to just walk out. Then they brought out drinks and cakes, and as I’d paid $2 (£1.50) to attend I decided I might as well get my money’s worth before leaving.”The world of Cults: in picturesThe world of Cults: in picturesAravindan Balakrishnan, known as ‘Comrade Bala’ within the women-only collective he founded 40 years ago, carried out a brutal campaign of sexual degradation against the women over several decades.

Aravindan Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years in 2016. To keep his devotees in check, Balakrishnan invented \u0027Jackie\u0027, which he said could kill or trigger earthquakes if anyone went against his will. He claimed that a challenge to his leadership resulted in the 1986 space shuttle disaster and Jackie, an invisible war machine, was responsible for the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour party leader. PAwords by Hardeep Matharu Jim Jones, founder of the Peoples Temple sect in Jonestown, north Guyana, in 1978. Believers of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ followed Reverend Jones to Guyana in the Seventies, hoping to create a utopia in the jungle. Jonestown was envisaged as a “rainbow family” of all ages and races, the preacher had promised them: “Divine principles. Total equality. A society where people own all things in common, where there is no rich or poor, where there are no races.” APwords by Adam LusherReverend Jones wanted to create a glorious sacrifice, a defiant act of “revolutionary suicide” that would echo through history. Some disciples willingly colluded, cheering as he exhorted them to kill themselves and their children. But the bodies found with bent needles in their arms testified to the fact that some refused and were forcibly injected. Rexwords by Adam LusherWhen they finally counted the bodies after what would become known as the Jonestown massacre of 18 November 1978, the total came to 918, of whom 304 were children. They had been persuaded to “drink the Kool-Aid”, Flavor Aid, used to mask the bitter taste of cyanide, mixed with a dash of Valium.APwords by Adam LusherMaude Julien, now 60, was forced to hold onto an electric fence for without showing feeling as a child. The ritual was considered to be a test of her willpower by her father, who wanted to make her “superhuman”.\u0026#13Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and the free-love community which was built up around him in Oregon in the 1980s. Rajneesh, who died in 1990, was a charismatic Indian guru (who relocated to the US after the Indian government frowned upon his activities). His disciples gave huge amounts of cash to their figurehead and lost contact with their families.During a break he went into the corridor for a cigarette, and that’s when the cult members pounced. Haworth had seen his doctor not long before and been told if he carried on smoking like he did he’d be lucky to see 40. The group told him that they would absolutely guarantee he would stop smoking if he attended a further course for $220. He’d already looked into smoking-cessation courses that were of comparable cost, so decided he’d give this one a go.“The course took place in September, 1978,” says Haworth. “By the end of the course I’d given notice at my job, promised to dedicate my life to the cult, and handed over all my savings, which amounted to about $1,500.”Jonestown commune mass suicide in 1978 (AP)Even now, Haworth cannot identify the tipping point that turned him from someone who’d turned up for a meeting at the behest of an attractive woman to someone who gave himself, body and soul, to a cult, other than mid-way through the course when he stopped smoking. “I suppose that was the moment I went over to them – they had done what they said they would do.”Cults often thrive on feeding into people’s desires. Sometimes they will promise success, artistic or creative talent, fulfil a desire in their targets to effect social change or, as with Haworth, to “give something back” to the world. They will promise freedom from addictions or improved physical or mental health. They’re what Haworth calls therapy cults, as opposed to the religious cults that offer more spiritual promises.If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had. You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situationOver the next month, Haworth tried to recruit his friends and even neighbours to the group. They were appalled at the change in him, but, he says, “I thought they were wrong, I knew they weren’t part of the elite, like I was.”It was an almost textbook recruitment, and Haworth firmly believes he would have been lost to everyone who knew him but for one error on the part of the cult. “Most cults programme their members against the media very early on. These people didn’t do that,” he says. And that was what saved him.A neighbour gave him a copy of the Toronto Star which had featured a front-page exposé of the group Haworth was involved in, written by the investigative reporter Sidney Katz. Haworth read the piece and contacted Katz immediately to verify his facts. He then, as he describes it, “fell apart at the seams”. Having seen Katz’s research and evidence first hand, at the invitation of the journalist, Haworth angrily confronted the cult’s leaders, and they effectively banished him. He was finally free of them.“That was in October,” he says. “Then, in the November, everything came out about the Jonestown cult. And I knew that could have been me. It took me 11 months to fully recover and get back to myself.”NXIVM (which calls itself a ‘multi-level marketing organisation’) member Allison Mack leaving US District Court after her bail hearing in Brooklyn (Getty)It took that long for the nagging whispers of “Cult Ian”, as Haworth describes the person he was when he was with the group, to be finally silenced, and for “Real Ian” to reassert himself. And good sense would dictate that was the point he turned his back on cults forever and got on with his life.“I come from a farming background in Lancashire,” says Haworth. “People used to say, ‘If there’s summat up, then tha’ does summat about it’. So I did summat about it.”Sidney Katz put Haworth in touch with a TV producer called Peter Scott and together they set up what was first called the Council for Mind Abuse, and which later metamorphosed into the Cult Information Centre in 1987, now run as a charity.I’ve dealt with more than 1,000 different cults. That includes the Rajneesh group. The Netflix documentary series has generated a lot of interest internationally, which can’t be a bad thingHaworth and Scott concentrated on the group he had been involved with, even handing out flyers to a party of new recruits flown into Canada, exhorting them to go back to the airport. Faced with Haworth’s evidence, many of them did. Eventually, the resistance proved too much for the group. “Toronto wasn’t big enough for the both of us,” he smiles. “They got out.”Haworth doesn’t know where they are now, or if they still exist. Cults change their names often, to keep one step ahead of the media or inquisitive minds, and to muddy the paper trail they leave behind. Besides, he soon had more than enough on his plate as more and more people began to get in touch, especially after he had relocated back to the UK.One of the Cult Information Centre’s primary roles is working with ex-cult members. He likens the trauma that recovering cult followers go through to PTSD, and says systems to deal with and help them are variable, if present at all.He would also like to see stronger laws to deal with cults there’s no specific legislation surrounding them, and it’s only when cult leaders are discovered to have committed actual crimes, such as Aravindan Balakrishnan in 2015, that the law can act.Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh surrounded by devotees (Netflix)The Aravindan Balakrishnan case, and the revelations of Katy Morgan-Davies in her new book, add an extra dimension to Haworth’s work. It’s one thing to try to help cult members who have managed to break free return to their old, pre-cult lives, but what of those born into cults?“If you’re born into a cult you don’t have that ‘Real Ian’ vs ‘Cult Ian’ internal battle that I had,” says Haworth. “You emerge from that and the first question is… who am I? It’s an incredibly difficult and delicate situation.”And don’t think it is only stupid people who would fall for a cult. Experts say that cults are most likely to be attractive to intelligent, well-educated people… they have flexible minds can consider and be seduced by the alternative lifestyles offered by cults.Documentary about alleged sex cult NXIVM being producedSmallville actor allegedly tried to recruit Emma Watson to ‘sex cult’Waco: what really happened when David Koresh’s cult faced the FBI?From Jonestown in the Seventies to Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s to Brixton in the 2000s: cults endure, and spring up all across the world. Nothing about modern life and its complexities has inured us against the attractions of a charismatic guru or cult leader.“They start off wanting the usual things,” says Haworth. “Money, sex, power over people. Then, after perhaps about 10 years, they start to believe the things they say, they maybe start to believe they are gods.”And as long as the false gods continue to prey on the innocent, Ian Haworth will continue his 40-years-and-counting battle against the scourge of the cults.For more information on Haworth’s work at the Cult Information Centre go to cultinformation.org.ukor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Serendipitously, at the start of this bicentennial year, I found myself invited to a wedding in what used to be called Karl-Marx-Stadt, since renamed Chemnitz, in the former East Germany. Communism may have formally collapsed with the downfall of the Soviet Union, yet it has not been extinguished.The world’s most populous state and rising superpower, China, is officially communist, albeit nominally. And socialist ideas remain prevalent throughout the world. The resurgence of socialism could be seen in the Chavismo new left wave of Latin American politics (admittedly now in the process of being rolled back). In the US, self-proclaimed socialist senator Bernie Sanders could well have been as unlikely an occupant of the Oval office as Donald Trump – if the Democratic National Committee had not conspired against him.In the UK, unapologetic socialist Jeremy Corbyn  swept to the leadership of Her Majesty’s opposition, appointed Trotskyist John McDonnell as shadow chancellor (McDonnell recently told the Financial Times that their aims for Britain are socialist), pronounced socialism as no longer a dirty word to a delirious conference, before garnering 40 per cent of the vote in the general election. In France, Jean Luc Mélenchon performed respectably in the first round of the French elections, commanding nearly 20 per cent of the vote. In Greece, the left-wing Syriza government remains in power – even though its manifesto has been crushed by international finance capital. Its former finance minister and firebrand Yanis Varoufakis describes himself as a lapsed Marxist. His recent essay penned in  cites Marx’s analysis as both the key to understanding our present predicament and the way out of it.John McDonnell says he won\u0027t be a Marxist ChancellorIn 2015, socialism was the most searched word on Merriam Webster’s online dictionary. Socialism does not carry historical baggage for a younger generation left behind by the iniquities of capitalism. A Harvard study found that a majority of millennials reject capitalism and a third are in favour of socialism. This is what might be called the revenge of Marx the rehabilitation of one of the world’s historical philosophers. Marx inverted Hegelian doctrine into dialectical materialism, affirming that it was material relations that were responsible for consciousness and social relations  –  not the other way round. In 2011, back when it was still unfashionable to confess to being Marxist, Oxford University literary theorist Professor Terry Eagleton boldly decreed that the bearded prophet had been right after all. Eagleton is no longer alone.A slew of books herald the end of capitalism, in the words of economic sociologist Wolfgang Streeck, and announce that we are entering the epoch of Postcapitalism, according to the gospel of journalist and author Paul Mason. The most dangerous philosopher in the West, Slavoj Zizek,  according to The New Republic magazine ,  is communist one of his recent tomes, Living in the End Times, conjures up the apocalyptic sense of the death throes of capitalism.Of course, it wasn’t meant to be like this. Marx’s ideas had apparently been discredited with the collapse of communism and consigned to Trotsky’s dustbin of history. Hadn’t history proven that communism was not a historical inevitability? Then came the 2008 financial crash and the demise of political economist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. A decade of austerity was the death knell for the ideological vacuum. The fall-out has seen a polarisation between authoritarian nationalism and progressivism between dystopia and NOT dystopia, if you like.Neoliberalism​  always presented itself as depoliticised, in that the free market is akin to an all-enveloping atmosphere and as irresistible as a force of nature. Its allocation of resources and outcomes supposedly only required mere supervision through technocratic managerialism. In reality, it could not have been more ideological, operating through the corporate capture of the state and hollowing out of the institutions of civic society. Global capitalism appeared to be indomitable and impregnable, in so far as it was the hegemonic system. Yet at the same time, the delayed reaction of a series of political earthquakes, in the form of the Arab Spring and a wave of authoritarian populism, has exposed its vulnerabilities. Even if these events have not challenged the fundamental basis of the system, its neoliberal globalisation variant is under attack.Yanis Varoufakis was at the forefront of Greece’s radical left coalition (Getty)Mao Zedong’s description of capitalism as a paper tiger seems as pertinent as ever. Marxism bequeathed a rich legacy of thinkers, ranging from Lenin and Trotsky to the Frankfurt school, as well as the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Fredric Jameson and Alain Badiou. It was once unthinkable to break with Marxist orthodoxy on the left. Until, as American Marxist Marshall Berman relates in his modern classic All that is Solid Melts into Air (taking its cue from the famous phrase in the Communist Manifesto), a group of disaffected French post-structuralists and postmodernists, namely Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes, did just that. Disillusioned by the defeat of May 1968, when an uprising against De Gaulle resulted in his party emerging even stronger than before, they broke ranks.Raoul Peck: I Am Not Your Negro director on his film about Karl MarxPub where Marx and Engels discussed communist theory shuts downKarl Marx is \u0027back in fashion,\u0027 says shadow chancellor John McDonnellIs Jeremy Corbyn, in the words of his favourite philosopher Karl Marx,\u0027We can learn a great deal from Marx\u0027, says Jeremy CorbynIn the intervening decades, the battles of identity politics have been significant but they have also been hampered by the lack of a structural, systemic understanding of how capitalism operates. Where resistance has mirrored the fragmented, atomised, hyper-inidualism of neoliberalism then it has often been doomed to failure. All of which is very much bound up with the Cold War victory of the US empire. The CIA saw its chance, according to a recently declassified research paper. The agency read French postmodern theory, concluding that its questioning of the objective basis of reality could be used to undermine the Marxist doctrine of historical and teleological inevitability. Millions of dollars were pumped into front organisations such as magazines, publishing houses and favoured academics, in order to push postmodern ideas and to create a centre left, thus demarcating the outer boundary of respectable ideas – anything beyond which could be denounced as dangerous and radical lunacy. After all, the strategy of ide and rule has generally been the preferred one of the ruling class.Karl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesKarl Marx: social, political and economic theorist in picturesGerman social, political and economic theorist Karl Marx.

The statues, created by artist Ottmar Hoerl, are part of an exhibition at the Museum Simeonstift Trier that were created to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the death of Marx in 1883. Marx, who was born in Trier, is the author of The Communist Manifesto, and his ideas on the relationship between labour, industry and capital created the ideological foundation for socialist and communist movements across the globe. Marx was familiar with the methods of the ruling class. He was often on the run from European authorities, eventually finding refuge in the relative tolerance of London where he ided up his time between his smoke-filled home (Soho then later Kentish town), the British Library and watering holes. His rebellious life  –  immersed in the struggles of the 19th century, from the 1848 revolutions to the Paris commune  –  lent itself, naturally, to the counterculture of the late 20th century. And now to the glamour of the big screen. A new Marx biopic – The Young Karl Marx   from I Am Not Your Negro director Raoul Peck  –  has been released. Marx’s starting point, outlined in his 1844 letter For A Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing to fellow philosopher Arnold Ruge, is a philosophical tabula rasa comparable to a Cartesian wiping of the slate clean. This position of ‘Kritik’, adopted by the young Hegelians, gradually evolved into praxis for Marx. Hence, in Theses on Feuerbach (1888), Marx states “the philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point, however, is to change it”.The Communist Manifesto itself was not merely a political and economic tract. It is a call to arms, as well as a work of canonical sublimity and literary fecundity by turns poetic, inspired and visionary. Author and journalist Francis Wheen’s biography describes the Damascene moment at which Marx anoints the word ‘proletariat’. It descends on to the page like a thunderclap across the landscape, presaging the revolutions to come of the 20th century. In the wide-ranging debate Die Judenfrage, or The Jewish Question, Marx posits that the liberal definition of freedom is limited. The motto of ‘Liberté, Egalité, Fratérnité’ of the French revolution is just that  –  a good slogan. To take one example, equality does not relate to power or wealth but merely denotes equality before the law.Marx formulates that consciousness is generated by the mode of production, in a classic inversion of the Hegelian system. He defined alienation as the quintessential state of mind and being under capitalism, corresponding to the economic relations of commodification, exploitation and oppression. It is a state of mind that is little understood by the billions who experience it daily. Thus, bourgeois society is predicated on economic inidualism, private ownership and self-interest. The relations between iniduals, including intimate relations, are thus egoistical. Pure self-interest becomes the prime driver of not just economic processes but all relations. Under capitalism, every entity, no matter how sacred, can be transformed, exploited and sold for profit. This is what Marx meant by the intrinsic process of commodification. And it is this limitless commodification which extends into every sphere, including sex, the body and relationships.Lenin (left) and Trotsky were two of the 20th century’s greatest revolutionaries inspired by Marxism (Getty)Online pornography, social media  and dating apps are merely the latest extrapolations of this relentless commodification. Furthermore, social roles and relations are engendered by historical modes of production. Thus, the agrarian, feudal world corresponds to the social strata of monarchy aristocracy and the church dominating and exploiting the peasantry. Similarly, the industrial, urbanised world corresponds to the social structure of the bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. In a memorably thunderous passage in The Communist Manifesto, Marx extrapolates this connection between social and economic relations to define free trade: “It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom  –  Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.”Marx outlined the history of mankind as the history of class struggle in which the classes are opposed in a dialectical paradigm. Thus, we move from antiquity with the duality of slave owner and slaves to the feudal age of lord and serf to the capitalist age of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is these same unsustainable contradictions that Marx later proposes will bury capitalism, when the burgeoning proletariat become the ‘gravediggers’ of the bourgeoisie. This ‘final’ stage will usher in communism, completely transforming and reconfiguring the previous relations into a classless society. Marx outlines that communism, in abolishing private property, also abolishes alienation and wage bondage, leading to worker emancipation and, by extension, universal emancipation. Nevertheless, Marx subscribes to the enlightenment belief in the rationality and logic of mankind to create a narrative of progress. The bourgeois capitalist system is perceived as a necessary step in this progression, enabling the transition from a feudal, agrarian society into an urban, industrialised one. Thus, the bourgeoisie is portrayed as having played a revolutionary role in transforming the world. In its propensity for upheaval and turmoil, capitalism never ceases to alter the world.A monument to Karl Marx in the German city Chemnitz, formerly Karl-Marx-Stadt (Getty)The dialectical materialist analysis of the history of class struggle played out in the contradictions of Marx’s own life. Whether in his marriage to the aristocratic Jenny Von Westphalen, or his friendship with industrialist Friedrich Engels, which enabled the genius of Marx and offset the penury of his journalism and political activities. Some of the most switched-on uber capitalists and masters of the universe concede that Marx’s basic analysis of capitalism has never been improved upon. Trump billionaire backer and donor Peter Thiel states that the breakdown of the status quo points either towards libertarianism or Marxism. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett  infamously once said: “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”The Marxist critique of capitalism hinges on its innate tendency towards concentration and centralisation of wealth. In Capital Volume 1, Marx fleshes out the M-C-M circuit (in which M is money and C is commodities). This circuit guarantees the expansion of capital, providing the economic basis of capitalism as a mechanism for limitless capital accumulation. The resulting crises of overproduction and capital accumulation are resolved through the enforced destruction of productive forces, the conquest of new markets and more thorough exploitation paving the way for more extensive and destructive crises. Fracking might be viewed as the ultimate metaphor for this process, whilst Uber is emblematic of the same hyper-exploitation.French economist Thomas Piketty’s work, updating the original title to Capital in the Twenty-First Century, using a large amount of historical data, has further corroborated Marx’s theories on the concentration of wealth. Unsurprisingly, several decades of neoliberalism have been the greatest testament to how a deregulated capitalism, red in tooth and claw, siphons wealth to the top 1 per cent or even 0.1 per cent. Recent figures show that the wealthiest eight billionaires in the world (whom you could fit into a people carrier) have as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, or some 3. 5 billion people. Astonishingly, the equivalent figure was the 62 wealthiest billionaires in 2016. Back in 2010 it was more than 300. This is how rapidly wealth is being sucked up to the top  – this may be termed the vacuum-up effect as opposed to the myth of trickle-down economics.Stefan Konarske, left, as Friedrich Engels and August Diehl as Karl Marx in ‘The Young Karl Marx’ (Rex)Whilst Victorian capitalism was dominated by small-to-medium-sized companies, the middle decades of the 20th century witnessed a shift to statist capitalism. In effect, the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China  represented variations on this theme. Since then the age of globalisation has been ushered in with multinational corporations straddling the globe – many of them larger than the states they operate in. The movement of vast pools of capital on a global scale is historically unmatched. Mega mergers seem to be rarely out of the headlines. In other words, the centralisation Marx predicted 150 years ago is panning out.There is a one-way trend towards the control of capital by an ever smaller number of players. Neoliberal doctrine emphasises the virtues of competition. Yet the reality of deregulated free markets, most evidently in financial services, has been monopoly, cartels, collusion and rigging. This is evidenced by the big four dominance in every sector from banking, accountancy, magic circle law firms, to high street supermarkets, energy companies and privatised utilities. The contradictions of the system have now attained a new level of absurdity.Capitalists presently invest in existing money, be it financial instruments, housing or debt, in order to make profit. In fact, this financialisation of the economy has superseded the traditional profit-making processes of manufacturing. Unlike manufacturing, this financialisation does not create value. Instead it creates asset bubbles of financial and housing speculation, which eventually burst, as happened on a seismic scale in the 2008 crash. Since the 1970s there have been a series of escalating market crises  – yet even this volatility is profitable for hedge funds.Civil unrest in France in 1968 was described as a social revolution against capitialism (Getty)So if late capitalism is economically, socially and ecologically unsustainable, not to mention bankrupt, then whither to from here? One of the obtuse criticisms of Marx has been the lack of a blueprint, despite the fact that a participatory, truly democratic society would need to emerge organically rather than following a roadmap. Marx posited revolution as “the driving force of history”. The overthrow of the existing state and the dissolution of property would lead to liberation extending to the dissolution of the bourgeois conceptions of family, marriage and all nation states. This liberation from national barriers would then bring everyone into connection with the production of the whole world for the pleasure of their consumption.Under communism, Marx daintily describes how one would be able to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening and criticise after dinner (naturally). Communism would appear to truly represent the end of the history, or at least the end of history, as class struggle :  “Communism is the riddle of history solved and it knows itself to be this solution.” Marx formulates that human emancipation can only be achieved by going beyond the bourgeois framework material emancipation translates into spiritual and sensuous emancipation. Only the resolution of the material modes of production, beyond the paradigm of economic inidualism, private property and self-interest, can liberate consciousness and revolutionise social relations  –  such that there is the capacity, the capability and propensity for free behaviour and genuine ties between iniduals based on love, warmth and affection, rather than purely calculating and cold self-interest.The exultant victory lap of all-singing, all-dancing capitalism has been remarkably brief the unipolar moment of American triumphalism short-lived. Only recently, US defence secretary Jim Mattis  announced that the era of great power politics has returned. Undoubtedly, a set of progressive ideas is coalescing amongst the new left  –  a green economy, public and democratic control of the economy, full automation. This 21st century manifesto is embodied in such books as Inventing the Future. The critical question remains of the vehicle necessary to bring about this transition.There is no doubt that 21st-century global capitalism is far more sophisticated and resilient than that of pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russia. The transition of capitalism to an alternative political and economic system will likely play out over a protracted period, even if it is catalysed by revolution. Much in the same way that feudalism evolved into capitalism through the dual industrial (economic) and French revolutions (political), in which the bourgeoisie superseded the aristocratic order preceded by the 17th-century English civil war.Or to leave the last word to Marx: “No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.”Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The rate is significantly higher than on many unsecured personal loans available from high street banks.“As RPI has been de-designated as a national statistic, the committee has urged the government to abandon its use to calculate student loan interest rates in favour of CPI,” Ms Morgan said.“In its response to the committee’s report, the Department for Education acknowledged the flaws of RPI, but argued that continuing its use has provided consistency over time.UK Government to repackage student loans Budget 2017: Graduates to stop overpaying student loans Half of millennials would give up right to vote to clear student loansHow to use a student loan to build a £4m travel business “Continuing to use a measure that it readily admits is flawed, on the grounds of consistency, is absurd it guarantees that student loan interest rates will be consistently flawed.”The comments came as the Treasury Committee published the government’s response to its highly critical report on the current student loans system.The government said: “RPI has always been used for calculating interest on student loans, providing consistency over time.”It added: “The flaws in the RPI measure of inflation are well understood, and the Office for National Statistics have delivered a substantial programme of work to improve the way they measure inflation over the last two years.“The review of post-18 education and funding will look at how students and graduates contribute to the cost of their studies, including the level, terms and duration of their contribution.“It is now for the independent panel to consider the issues raised within the terms of reference in their report to government. The government cannot prejudge the findings of the panel or outcomes of the review.”A study last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that three-quarters of students will never clear their loans and that graduates from low-income families finish their studies with the highest debt of more than £57,000 on average.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Don’t stop on the side of the road,” Doug Bos, the owner of the zoo, told CBC News in January, when the footage was shared. “If everybody would listen to the video, that’s what the message was – don’t do this.”Where not to visit if you love animalsWhere not to visit if you love animalsChimpanzees are forced to perform demeaning tricks on leashes and are often subject to cruel training techniques. Animals who are confined to small, barren enclosures and forced to perform unsurprisingly show symptoms of stress and depression. Chimpanzees have been documented rocking back and forth, sucking their lips, salivating and swaying against enclosure perimeters in distress.Some marine parks use bottlenose dolphins in performances and offer visitors the opportunity to swim with dolphins. Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.Sunning on the beach is great for humans – we can take a quick dip or catch a bite to eat when we get too hot or hungry. But it\u0027s pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times. Some parks confine orcas to concrete tanks and force them to perform meaningless tricks for food - many die in captivity. Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they\u0027re held in captivity.Lions are confined to fenced areas so that they can easily be cornered, with no chance of escape. Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a hunting enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.Every year, tourists travel to Pamplona for the Running of the Bulls. The bulls who are forced to slip and slide down the town\u0027s narrow cobblestone streets are chased straight into the bullring. They are then taunted, stabbed repeatedly and finally killed by the matador in front of a jeering crowd. The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs. City streets are no place for horses. The animals toil in all weather extremes, suffering from respiratory distress from breathing in exhaust fumes as well as numerous hoof, leg and back problems from walking on pavement all day long. As easily spooked prey animals, horses subjected to the loud noises and unexpected sounds of city streets are likely to be involved in accidents, even deadly ones. The zoo community regards the animals it keeps as commodities, and animals are regularly bought, sold, borrowed and traded without any regard for established relationships. Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there\u0027s nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we recently saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. At the time, a trainer said there were no safety concerns, as the bear was secured by a chain and the film had been taken before the Dairy Queen had opened for the day. Football team condemned after muzzled bear forced to deliver ballMan ‘trying to take selfie’ with bear is mauled to deathFirst polar bear bred in Singapore dies after five-year health battlePark staff accidentally kill one of world’s rarest bearsFemale bears evolve to hunting threat by raising cubs for longerThe zoo, located in Innisfail, Alberta, has now been charged under the Wildlife Act for taking the bear out without informing the authorities – one count relates to the ice cream excursion and the other for failing to inform officials the bear was being taken home nightly for bottle-feeding in 2017.The owners of the wildlife park, Mr Bos and Debbie Rowland, have said they plan to plead guilty. “We made a mistake. I’m embarrassed about it,” Mr Bos told . “Every time we take an animal off the property, we’re supposed to notify Fish and Wildlife, send them an email, and we forgot to do that in both instances.”The zoo’s permit has also been revised to include new conditions requiring the zoo to provide more details when transporting animals and to keep them in a cage, crate or kennel while in a vehicle.Members of the public will also be barred from having any contact with animals, including bears. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We reveal all...According to the New Scientist, plants need a period of cold then warm weather before they can flower.But because of the long winter, plants that couldnt flower earlier in the spring are more likely to do so all at once.The term is known as a condensed spring because it is far shorter than normal.This causes more pollen to be produced - causing misery for hayfever sufferers.Tree pollen is likely to be worse, which affects one in four Brits.Sadly it does, with the Met Office issuing a warning for high levels of pollen across south England.And Aprils pollen count looks like it will remain high.There is a high tree pollen count, with grass and weed becoming higher later in the year.Sufferers will experience cold-like symptoms - such as itchy eyes and a runny nose - but the threat could be more serious.Half of Brits plagued by hay fever could experience deadly asthma attacks triggered by the pollen.Hay fever and asthma are closely linked, with around 80 per cent of people with asthma finding their symptoms are made worse when pollen counts are high. Sonia Munde, nurse manager at Asthma UK, said anyone who has both asthma and hay fever should ensure they are taking antihistamines and nasal steroid sprays, and ensure they take their preventer inhaler as prescribed to ward off an attack.She added: Pollen is a top trigger for asthma attacks at this time of the year, affecting an estimated 3.3million people with asthma in the UK.People with asthma who also have a pollen allergy not only experience classic hay fever symptoms such as itchy eyes and a running nose, but are also at an increased risk of a life-threatening asthma attack.Holly Shaw, nurse adviser at Allergy UK, urged people to stock up on antihistamines to help manage their symptoms.Typically the hay fever season starts in mid-March, with tree pollen blooming until May.But this year, the Beast From The East blasted the country with icy weather, delaying spring.The Met Office said weather conditions will also play a role in how bad the pollen bomb hits — with hay fever sufferers praying for rain.A forecaster said We had some late snow and March was colder than average.The concern is that spring has been delayed and there will now be more flowering species coming into bloom at the same time.We advise people to keep an eye on the pollen maps that are forecast five days in advance. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that.

Shame on them.More MPs backed away from Tom Watson’s sinister “Section 40” bid to force papers into the death grip of Max Mosley’s Press-hating Impress crew.Watson’s sole aim was revenge against papers critical of Labour. He finally bottled out of a vote he knew he would lose. A malevolent conspiracy theorist, bully and liar . . . now a coward to boot.But the Labour lardbucket ­will not give up. Nor will his orgy-loving benefactor Mosley, nor Miliband, nor Hacked Off Hugh nor their weird, obsessive acolytes.The Tories will have to defend Press freedom again.

They are telling 17.4million people: “You don’t count. We do.”How do they imagine Leavers would react if the biggest vote in our history was negated by unelected, ermine-clad party stooges, some on EU pensions?We genuinely fear the consequences.It was the Lords, too, who began the attempt to muzzle the Press. They are rotting our democracy from within.IT is appalling that the Government is ­considering a new witch-hunt into Army veterans of the Troubles.The vast majority of unsolved murders were by terrorists, mostly since given immunity by the Labour Government.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has been advised she cannot legally exclude veterans.

A fog descends, confusion reigns, even my own handwriting is a mystery, the words written by a stranger who slipped away while I slept.It all started in 2012: I was 56, healthy, a non-smoker, and I worked as an NHS manager at St James’s Hospital in Leeds.But there was an impending sense of something I couldn’t put my finger on. It had lingered for a few months. Everything was getting slower. On bad days, my mind couldn’t instantly recall names and faces and places like it used to. It just wasn’t me.September 2012I’m the one my colleagues nickname the guru because my recall is so sharp, because I can problem-solve in a second, remembering who works night shifts, who needs which day off.I’d brought up my two daughters - Gemma and Sarah alone since their dad left when they were four and seven. It was hard, but there was always a way that was my motto.But the snowdrift that seems to have settled in my mind remains, along with a lack of energy and the same feeling I can’t put my finger on.One day I’m out running, and I fall flat onto the pavement. There are another three falls in quick succession.Later, I am sitting in a hospital waiting room.The sensation of a head half-filled with cotton wool has continued for months and this weekend had been much worse.When I got to work on Monday, my colleague noticed how my words were slurred, and now I’m here.In the end, doctors blame a hole in the heart for causing a stroke.March 2013 I’m back at work after the stroke.The things I do forget – names or numbers, places, people – well, that’s understandable. It’s because I’ve been off for months, or at least that’s what everyone says, and I start to believe it myself. Almost.But two months later, I’m sitting in front of a consultant neurologist, trying to pinpoint the vagueness I’ve been feeling.What sense would it make to her if I told her about that thick pile of yellow Post-it notes scattered on the carpet by my bed had got thicker and thicker, as I woke numerous times desperate to remember all I’ll need to get through a day in the office.My mind just doesn’t feel … sharp, is all I can offer, and the consultant nods and writes down some notes.A month on, I’m seeing a clinical psychologist called Jo.Is there anything I should do to help myself in the times when my mind feels particularly … foggy? I ask.There may be times when you become disorientated, the fog will descend and your surroundings will be unfamiliar,” she says. But the most important thing to remember is not to panic, give the fog time to pass, let the world become clear again. And it will.That’s all. She’ll see me again in 12 months.I’m sitting opposite Sarah while she holds a letter in her hand from Jo.It is possible that this is a profile of the early stages of a dementing process, it reads.A few weeks later, another letter, this time from the neurologist. To be certain [of this representing an early dementia] we would need to demonstrate deteriorating cognition in six to 12 months’ time. If no change I would diagnose mild cognitive impairment, he writes.Sarah and Gemma are with me as I read this. The three of us sit quietly.I look at my two little girls, that’s nothing to do with my memory, just the lens a mother always views her children through, the urge to protect them never dims.September 2013Six months later, I’m in a meeting at work.I glance around the table at the familiar faces, and yet I can’t recall their names.  Tiny seeds of worry whittle away inside as I shuffle my paperwork, confused about where to start.I look up. We expect to start rolling out the system in two months’ time … I pause, every eye upon me, but the word I need next is lost -  there’s a blank in my mind where it should be.Silence hangs in the room, and for a fraction of a second I’m sure they’re wondering if I’m fit for this job. I feel stupid then. Stupid, frustrated, confused, humiliated.An hour later, the meeting finishes, people file from the room, and then it comes to me. The word I was trying to remember was and.I wake and sit on the edge of my bed, looking down at my feet. Where once there was pale green carpet, I’m now crunching yellow Post-it notes between my toes.The pile has grown thicker after another restless night of waking, turning, remembering something else I’ll need for the next day. I need to move, but I can’t think what I do first. Dress? Eat? Shower?I’ve become a master of disguise, but there are days when I can’t camouflage the confusion. I dread the knock on my office door, the blank I know will be written across my face.A sister on the ward who phones me and I don’t know who she is. I buy time, ask her to come to my office. When she does, I realise we’re friends.I thought I’d done something to offend you! she’d said. And I laugh it off, blaming a busy day.June 2014I’m sitting in front of Jo again.She starts going through the same memory tests as before. But when she asks me to name objects beginning with a certain letter, nothing comes. She asks me to draw a clock, I don’t know where to start.It’s obvious to both of us that there’s been a decline, fear is gathering in the pit of my stomach.Over the next two weeks, I do more memory tests. They don’t go well. What do you think it could be? I ask finally.She looks into my eyes, and her voice is calm and steady. Possibly dementia, but I can’t be completely sure, not until we get the results of all the tests.Of course, I reply. But a numbness embraces me, and a sadness too, a feeling that this is the end because that’s all I know about dementia - the blank stares, the helplessness, the confusion.In bed later, I lie awake, unable to push dark thoughts from my mind. Is it really dementia? Might the doctors be wrong?July 31, 2014I’m sitting in the cramped office of the neurologist as she shuffles through her paperwork.As she starts to speak, I notice the pity in her eyes.It’s early-onset Alzheimer’s.Nothing prepares you for the feeling of emptiness.It’s not so much a fear of death that hits me, but a sense of time running out.That’s what dementia steals, the future you imagined all laid out in front of you, with no idea when something more final might come.Good luck, says the neurologist as I leave her office. I won’t see her again, because there’s no follow-up after diagnosis.September 2014I’ve been relying on the Post-It notes I write to myself, reminding me to take my pills, book a dental appointment. But they’re starting to fail me now.What good is a note to yourself if you forget to look for it?I pull the calendar down from the wall and start to fill my iPad with doctor’s appointments, friends’ visits, a daily reminder to take my tablets and to put the rubbish bins out.I hesitate over October 17th, Sarah’s birthday, just a few weeks away.Surely I’d never forget a date as important as that - but just in case, I set a reminder for the evening of her birthday. Anyway, I always ring her in the morning.October 17, 2014I go to work, then come home and start making myself something to eat. I’m humming along to the radio when I hear a ping.Puzzled, I open up the iPad. And when I see the reminder, my insides turn icy-cold. It can’t be. There must be a mistake.I check the date on the calendar, abandon my meal and reach for the phone. I’m shaking as I dial Sarah’s number.I’m so sorry, I say. I-I don’t know how it happened.It’s OK, she says. You just forgot.Nothing can ease the sadness, the mortification: I’ve forgotten my own daughter’s birthday for the first time in 34 years.My logical mind knows that it’s the disease, not me, but on a day like today it’s hard to tell us apart.February 2015Six months after the diagnosis. I tell my managers, my heart beating so hard I wonder if it can be seen through my shirt.A month later, I’m having a meeting with the occupational health consultant. I’m still managing my team efficiently— I begin.But she’s already filling in a section headed: Incapable of meeting the demands of her NHS employment.My fate has been decided.It’s Sunday, and I’m ironing at home in front of the TV.I’ve discovered upsides to dementia. I can watch The Great British Bake Off again and again.When I get to the series finale, the winner is always a surprise to me, and then I go right back to the first episode and get to know the contestants all over again.A progressive illness can focus the mind in a very special way, and I’ve resolved to find out all there is to know about this dreadful disease.I vow that I’m going to remain independent for as long as I possibly can.There’s always a way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And he revealed Ms Boudchar – who was watching from the gallery - would be receiving £500,000 in compensation as well as legal costs.Furious MPs lined up to slam ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair and the former Labour government for their “shame”.The so-called rendition came two weeks before Mr Blair held his infamous “deal in the desert” summit with Gaddafi – announcing Libya had joined the fight against Al-Qaeda and a massive oil exploration deal for UK giant Shell.Tory backbencher Sir Edward Leigh stormed: “The Minister says he can’t criticise or shouldn’t criticise the Blair government, but we can.“Has any apology been given this morning from Mr Blair for rendering the opponent of a murderous regime into the hands of that regime.”SNP justice spokeswoman Joanna Cherry demanded assurances there could never be a repeat. She added: “Can he tell us whether the investigations that have gone into settling this claim have uncovered whether what happened here is part of the dark side of Tony Blair’s deal in the desert with Gaddafi in 2004?”Abdel Belhaj was the leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group denounced as terrorists by Gaddafi. He fled the country in 2001.He was tortured frequently during six years in a Libyan prison. His wife – five months pregnant at the time of her kidnapping in 2004 – was freed shortly before giving birth.Their plight only came to light when documents were discovered in the British embassy after the violent overthrow of the Gaddafi government in 2011.They included a faxed letter from Sir Mark in which he congratulated Gaddafi’s intelligence chief Moussa Koussa on the “safe arrival” of Mr Belhaj, saying that it was “the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years”.In a statement yesterday, ex-Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw yesterday said he had “limited” recollection of the events.But admitted that he had approved “some information to be shared with international partners” on March 1 2004.Speaking alongside Ms Boudchar outside Parliament yesterday, Cori Crider from the Reprieve charity said: “The Government spent a heck of a lot of money on its own legal team defending the case.“This could have been done immediately and pretty cheaply.”In a statement “In every case where my approval was sought I assumed and was entitled to assume that the actions for which my approval was sought was lawful. This included in appropriate cases obtaining assurances as to the human treatment of those concerned.”Mr Straw said: “This case clearly raises serious issues. However I remain constrained for national security reasons as to what further I can say publicly.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The world\u0026#8217s worst Ebola outbreak took the lives of 11,000 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in 2014 after the virus spread from a young boy living in a village in rural Guinea. Poorly equipped and understaffed medical workers turned down infected patients and when the disease spread to the densely populated Liberian capital of Monrovia a health crisis turned into a catastrophe.In early 2016, the WHO said the outbreak had been contained and eliminated but 17,000 survivors were left traumatised and fearful of the future.Over the past few days, the DRC\u0026#8217s near-neighbours like Nigeria have taken steps to prevent the spread of the virus by introducing checks and health screening at its airports.Meanwhile, the Trump administration signalled its disinterest when it asked for ebola-related funding cuts of US$252 million, as part of a package aimed at reigning in government spending."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-israel-iran-golan-heights_4305596.jpg?20180510120659 ","title":"iran and israel a new conflict in the making","story":"We have now seen the two foes trade blows.Israel says its forces in the occupied Golan Heights were targeted by Iranian rocket fire.More than 20 Fajr 5 and Grad rockets were launched - four of them were intercepted by Israel\u0027s Iron Dome defence system and the rest fell short, crashing into Syrian soil.

Officials have invited foreign firms to bid for the \u0026pound1billion contract. But, speaking in Govan, Glasgow, The Labour leader is expected to accuse the Conservatives of trashing the UK\u0027s shipbuilding tradition and attempting to accelerate its decline. He will say: “Workers in British shipyards, from Plymouth to Rosyth, share a proud tradition - building the best ships in the world. “But the Conservative Government is trashing that tradition by offering up the Ministry of Defence’s most recent contract for three new Fleet Solid Support Ships to overseas’ companies to build abroad. “This decision is wrong. “Today we are calling on the Government to guarantee that these three new ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary will be built in domestic shipyards. “Building these ships in Britain would benefit those working in and supporting our world-class shipbuilding industry.  Mr Corbyn will say building the ships in the UK could secure more than 6,500 jobs - 1,800 of these in shipyards. Our shipyards used to produce half of all new ships worldwide. Our current market share is now less than half a percent. The Tories seem hell-bent on accelerating and deepening this industrial decline, he is expected to add. The next Labour government will use public contracts as part of our bigger plans to upgrade our economy. Don\u0027t listen to anyone who says we can\u0027t build things in Britain and that a casino economy, which produces little but soaring inequality and insecurity, is our only future. Shipbuilding is not a lame duck, and can have a high tech, high skilled and exciting future right here in the UK.  He will add: The Government claims that it is overseeing a \u0027renaissance\u0027 in British shipbuilding. But Scottish employers have pushed through one set of redundancies after another in recent years. Our proposal would both sustain existing shipbuilding and supply chain jobs, and create new ones - right here in Scotland and also across the UK. An MOD spokesman reiterated that Britain was witnessing a renaissance in national shipbuilding, saying all its warships are built in the UK, with the Clyde securing 4,000 jobs until 2035 having been given a commitment it will build the Navy\u0027s eight planned Type 26 Frigates. He added: We are launching a competition for three new Fleet Solid Support ships this year and strongly encourage British yards to take part.

Green charities say the protections will be weaker after we quit the bloc because it is unlikely to have the same clout as current rules. While Labour mocked the Environment Secretary as the Secretary of State for Consultations because he has failed to bring in any primary legislation since the General Election. The government was expected to unveil a new environment watchdog today but instead they kicked the issue down the road by launching a consultation. The Tories have committed to a statutory, independent watchdog which would hold ministers to account. Environmental measures from improving air and water quality and protecting endangered species are currently overseen by the European Commission which has the power to take ministers to court.  These are underpinned by green principles across the EU, such as the polluter pays. Mr Gove said in November that a new body which would have “real bite”. But groups say the new regime will put the environment at risk unless it can initiate legal action. And they want the environmental protections to be written into a new law, rather than in a policy statement which would give ministers more flexibility to adopt different principles.  There are also calls to enshrine in law targets for boosting nature over the coming years. While many are concerned that the consultation will not look at climate change.  Shaun Spiers, chairman of Greener UK which is a coalition of 13 major environmental groups, said the consultation proposes to give the environment and countryside less protection after Brexit than exists now.  He said the plans contained no commitment to give the new watchdog power to initiate legal action, or to enshrine vital environmental principles such as the polluter pays in law. This is hugely disappointing and suggests that some ministers do not want to be held to account on laws that protect our beaches, habitats and air quality.  Unless the watchdog has powers like the European Commission to take the Government to court, green laws could be undermined, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust\u0027s Peter Morris warned. It\u0027s like creating a police force that can only give advice and feedback to people who commit crimes rather than having any power to arrest them, he said. Tony Juniper, executive director of WWF, said the new environmental watchdog needed strong jaws and big teeth, and real targets for it enforce. Setting targets for nature\u0027s recovery won\u0027t just help save our wildlife, it will also have economic, social, health and quality of life benefits, he urged. Kierra Box, Brexit campaign lead at Friends Of The Earth, added: There are many problems with this consultation. For starters, the scope is too narrow, not even attempting to cover climate change. It makes no sense for a new environmental watchdog to have no enforcement powers in relation to the most pressing environmental issue we face.  Unveiling the plans, Environment Secretary Michael Gove insisted the Government would not weaken environmental protections as the UK left the EU. He said a new Environmental Principles and Governance Bill would ensure core environmental principles remained central to government policy and decision-making, and the watchdog would champion and enforce standards. This will hold governments to account for delivering their commitments to the natural world, he said "},{"url":null,"title":"tory ministers slammed dragging heels","story":"NewsTory ministers accused of dragging their heels over Windrush compensation schemeDiane Abbott MP says victims need the money now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent21:11, 10 MAY 2018Updated21:12, 10 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Tory Ministers have been slammed for dragging their heels on a compensation scheme for the victims of the Windrush scandal .  Those affected are being invited to submit details of their ordeals as the Government draws up a compensation scheme for those affected. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it was the first step towards establishing the scheme, with a consultation on the proposed technical details to follow.   But Diane Abbott, Labour\u0027s Shadow Home Secretary , slammed the government for being so slow to act.  Two weeks ago a Home Office Minister Nadhim Zahawi,appeared on the Today programme and gave assurances that the Home Office would have dealt with compensation by now.  Today\u0027s announcement is just a call for evidence with no indication how long victims will have to wait. Ms Abbott, said: This should have begun when Ministers first became aware of the situation, and they have fallen short of their promise to deal with compensation within two weeks. People are desperate now, some of them destitute or homeless as a result of this Government’s policies. The Government should be announcing what immediate action it will take to help victims and give full compensation for the losses experienced by the Windrush generation.” People who have been living legally in the UK for decades have lost their jobs, been denied access to NHS treatment, benefits and pensions, had their driving licences withdrawn and been warned they face deportation.  The Home Office today launched a month-long call for evidence to help develop a system to provide redress for people who experienced financial losses because of difficulties proving their immigration status. Mr Javid said: People of the Windrush generation have unfairly had the lives they have built in the UK turned upside down. That is not fair. If we are to design a compensation scheme that effectively addresses the issues these people have faced it is vital that we listen. To put things right we need to understand more about what happened and to understand the personal stories. That is exactly what today\u0027s call for evidence is about. People caught up in the saga are invited to answer questions about how they were affected, when they first knew there was a problem and what losses they experienced. In a written statement to the Commons, Mr Javid said: I want to put in place a compensation scheme as quickly and as carefully as possible, to help redress what has gone wrong.  The cabinet minister, who met with high commissioners from the Caribbean on Thursday, also announced that Martin Forde QC, himself the son of Windrush parents, will provide independent advice on the design of the compensation scheme. No official estimates have been given for the number of people who could be eligible. As of last week the number of potential Windrush cases reported to a dedicated Home Office taskforce stood at around 3,000.  Data published on Friday showed that, at the time of the last census in 2011, there were 5,193 Caribbean-born people living in England and Wales who arrived in the UK prior to 1971 and held no passport when the household survey was carried out seven years ago.  Plans for the scheme were first unveiled by former home secretary Amber Rudd , who resigned following controversy over immigration targets.

It sheds fresh light on how HIV - human immunodeficiency virus - infects cells during sexual intercourse. The development could lead to better treatments for the disease that has already claimed the lives of 35 million people across the globe. In the video the virus is illuminated with a fluorescent protein - making it appear as bright green dots. The French team of scientists has already begun work on developing a vaccine based on these early steps of transmission.  There are currently more than 36 million people in the world with HIV - including two million children. Although there is currently no cure, treatment can make a big difference. For the study the researchers created a model of genital tissue in a lab dish which included the cells that line mucous membranes, which are known as epithelial cells. The virus infects cells of the immune system called T cells. It\u0027s well known HIV is transmitted sexually. But how the virus crosses genital mucus membranes to reach the immune system has been a mystery.  The study published in Cell Reports now illustrates this process in real-time from start to finish.  Dr Morgane Bomsel, a molecular biologist at the Cochin Institute in Paris, said: We had this global idea of how HIV infects this tissue - but following something live is completely different.  The precise sequence of events can be defined - and we were very surprised by them. In the videos a T cell infected with HIV encounters the epithelial cells on the surface of the urethra - a tiny tube that carries urine from the bladder. A kind of pocket - called a virological synapse - forms as they come into contact. This spurs production of infectious HIV particles which appear as green fluorescent dots. In what looks like a shooting ray gun from a sci-fi movie the HIV spurts from the T cell into the epithelial cell. The HIV doesn\u0027t actually infect the cell but instead travels across it and is consumed by macrophages - another type of immune cell which HIV targets. After an hour or two - once the virus has been produced and shed - the cell contact ends and the infected T cell moves on. These infected T cells are present in all genital fluids that transmit infection. The researchers were surprised that the infected T cells seemed to target epithelial cells rather than macrophages. Dr Bomsel said: The macrophage just stays still - ready to get the virus when it escapes the epithelial cells.

The answer is not much more than a year, judging by one family’s horrendous experience. Great granddad Arthur Marshall bought the home in Rosewarne Park in Camborne, Cornwall, completing the purchase in May 2016. After he died in June 2017 his family tried to sell it. “We had a cash buyer for \u0026pound90,000 but due to all the faults that were found the home was not fit for sale,” said his daughter Ann Early. “There are numerous cracks appearing in the outside walls so water has got into the insulation, if you push the walls hard your hand goes straight through.”  She took up the issue with Berkeley Parks, the site owners, and the manufacturers Stately-Albion Limited. “The home was bought new from Berkeley Parks so should never have deteriorated like this so that by the time my father died 15 months later it was unsaleable,” she says.  “They say to do the repairs they need a week with no rain, which is going to be hard to get in Cornwall.”  Stately-Albion carried out one visit to make temporary repairs but now Ann says they are ignoring her emails. Ironically, its website boasts: “You can put your concerns to one side with the knowledge that your new home will be safe in our hands.” The home even came with a “Gold Shield” warranty, which Stately-Albion claims “provides your home with protection for 10 years against any major inherent defects”.

Simone Grainger and husband Steven discussed his drug use in a series of texts and WhatsApp messages to each other that were read out in court. Simone would leave the written messages as well as record voice messages, in which children can be heard playing in the background, to her husband including that marrying him was the worst mistake of her life. The messages centred around his drug use leading up to when her body was found in the first home they shared. Grainger, 32, is accused of hitting her over the head with a saucepan before strangling her and rolling her in blankets and leaving her in the conservatory of the house. Simone\u0027s cousin found her body when she visited the house because she was concerned she had not heard from her.  Grainger denies murdering his wife on November 4 last year and sat the dock at Reading Crown Court listening intently as 1,500 messages were read through by barristers. The court previously heard Simone had told a friend before her death how her sex life was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster, the hit ITV psychological drama.  Francis Fitzgibbon QC, prosecuting, said Simone had confided in two friends that she and Grainger had sex two days before her death.  He said: She said it was a bit like something from an episode of Doctor Foster. Despite Mrs Grainger\u0027s anger and frustration they maintained a degree of intimacy. Mr Fitzgibbon also outlined messages Grainger sent after he is accused of killing the mother of his two children, in which it was said he contacted a prostitute for sex.  A mixture of WhatsApp, text and iMessage\u0027s from early in 2017 to the morning of the death were read to the jury by the prosecution about Grainger\u0027s drug habits. Simone sent one message to Grainger saying: I don\u0027t wanna be with someone who makes me miserable. The next month, Simone again messaged the defendant with: You constantly defend yourself, you are weird at night and can\u0027t sleep. You\u0027re always making mistakes. Grainger replied: I\u0027m sick of going on like this, everyday you make me out to be a c**t. In June, Simone messaged her husband and said: You\u0027re a druggy and a liar, to which Grainger replied: I\u0027ll spend the rest of my married life making it up to you.  Simone later responded by saying I wish I hadn\u0027t married you. Then in a spate of late night messages in July, Simone said I seriously can\u0027t stand you, druggy is your middle name, coke head c**t, s**t dad, you\u0027re lucky the kids have got my dad, coke heads ain\u0027t family men, and p**s off and die. The next day as the arguing continued, Simone sent in a message: The coke stopped your brain, you made me want to stab you.  Grainger replied: I\u0027ve been a p***k and will make it up to you, I\u0027ll never leave without you knowing again. Simone responded: You\u0027re constantly doing it, druggy c**t. Call me a d**k again and I\u0027ll stab you, you\u0027re selfish c**k.  Into September, two months before the death of Simone, messages were sent both ways. Simone said: Go to work you sad p***k, go and live on your mum\u0027s sofa where you\u0027re destined to end up. FYI you\u0027re an a***hole, a druggy and a drunk. Grainger said: You think it\u0027s normal, that you want to stab me? In another series of messages, the mum of two said: We are over, stop taking me for a p***k. You\u0027re a f*****g b*****d and I hope you get what\u0027s coming for you, die. The jury then heard the messages between the couple after Grainger failed to turn up to the family Centre Parcs holiday after he had bought five bags of cocaine for the trip but had gone on a binge the night before. Grainger sent to a friend: I had five bags to take to Centre Parcs and ended up like Henry Hoover.

Doria Ragland is believed to have landed in London on Thursday, according to Good Morning America.  Meghan\u0027s mum and Dad, Thomas Markle, are to meet the Queen in the days before the wedding. They will spend time with Her Majesty, as well as Prince Philip, Prince Charles and wife Camilla, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It will also be the first time Mr Markle meets his future son-in-law, Harry.  Royal contributor Omid Scobie told GMA: Doria will be meeting Harry and Meghan\u0027s nearest and dearest while she\u0027s here, including close friend Jessica Mulroney, who arrives on Monday. It\u0027s no doubt a stressful and very busy time for Meghan so having her mother by her side, especially on Mother\u0027s Day, will no doubt alleviate some of those nerves.  Doria arrived in the UK as Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas began his journey to London, where he will give his daughter away. The former lighting director, who lives a humble life compared to his daughter\u0027s extravagant soon-to-be-royal existence, was pictured climbing into his silver Volvo en route to the airport.  The reclusive 73-year-old set off last night from his home in Rosarito, Mexico and crossed the US border into California. There he checked into a $70-a-night motel in San Diego and reportedly picked up supplies including Gas-X anti-bloating pills and Heineken beers.  Kensington Palace announced last week Mr Markle would give his daughter away at the May 19 Windsor Castle wedding, ending months of speculation.    He had earlier told the Mirror he\u0027d love to give Meghan , 36, away on the big day at St George\u0027s Chapel, adding: I’m very pleased. I’m delighted.   A royal spokesman said: “Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to welcoming Ms Markle\u0027s parents to Windsor for the wedding. Mr Thomas Markle and Ms Doria Ragland will be arriving in the UK in the week of the wedding, allowing time for Prince Harry\u0027s family, including The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to spend time with them before the big day. Both of the bride\u0027s parents will have important roles in the wedding. On the morning of the wedding, Ms Ragland will travel with Ms Markle by car to Windsor Castle. Mr Markle will walk his daughter down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel. Ms. Markle is delighted to have her parents by her side on this important and happy occasion.”    It was also announced last week that the royal wedding would “celebrate the memory” of Harry\u0027s mum, Princess Diana, with her three siblings invited and her sister Lady Jayne Fellows giving the reading.  He said: “In addition to having the support of The Queen, his father The Prince of Wales, and his brother Prince William as Best Man, Prince Harry is also keen to involve his mother\u0027s family in his wedding. “All three siblings of Diana, Princess of Wales will be in attendance and Lady Jane Fellowes will give the reading. “Prince Harry and Ms. Markle both feel honoured that Lady Jane will be representing her family and helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.” The Duchess of Cambridge, who gave birth to her third child less than two weeks ago, will attend the service.  However, little Prince Louis will not go, it was announced. Unusually, Meghan will not have a maid of honour and will instead only have children as bridesmaids on the day. Their names will be announced a few days before the wedding. The bride will stay outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding, with the accommodation yet to be announced.

Little 22-month Olivia\u0027s symptoms were dismissed as daydreaming but mum Lisa Taylor knew it was more. The tot kept losing her balance, had a lazy eye, would stare into the distance for ten seconds at a time and repeatedly covered her ears as if in pain. She actually had a huge tumour pressing on her optic nerve, which led her to going rapidly blind. The tumour is currently inoperable due to the severe risk to Olivia’s remaining eyesight.  But doctors initially said Olivia was staring into the distance because she simply had her head in the clouds. Mrs Taylor, 33, said: I was noticing little things so was taking her to the doctor quite a lot. Eventually she started getting a bit of a squint in her right eye and this lazy eye was her main symptom. We took her to an epilepsy specialist because she kept having blank outs where she stares for about ten seconds - doctors said she was daydreaming. I just knew something wasn\u0027t right. It was mother\u0027s instinct and so I kept taking her back. I went to A\u0026ampE a couple of times and to the opticians.  Eventually Olivia was diagnosed with a grade one hypothalamic chiasmatic glioma on January 4. The non-cancerous tumour arises in and around the optic nerve which connects the eye to the brain. She began chemotherapy on January 17 but had lost all her vision by February. She was scared to play alone and often sought her mother\u0027s hand for reassurance. There is a cyst around the tumour, and on March 22 surgeons operated on it to reduce pressure on her optic nerve. That teamed with the chemo has meant some of Olivia\u0027s missing vision has returned. In the meantime, her family have raised almost \u0026pound60,000, setting up a \u0027Go Fund Me\u0027 page shortly after she was diagnosed with donations reaching nearly \u0026pound40,000.

Ron Tucker, who died at the age of 92, was just 16 when he joined up in 1942, hiding his real age to serve his country. He volunteered for the new Parachute Regiment and, at 18, fought as part of the 9th Parachute Battalion in the D-Day landings. Shot four times, he carried on fighting and returned to the frontline. At his funeral at St Barnabas Church in his hometown of Middlesbrough today, Ron’s coffin was draped in the Union flag, with his Paras beret and badge on top.  Fifty veterans formed a guard of honour as one of their own was piped into the church through the raised flags of Parachute Regimental Associations. Rev Sam Tyndall told mourners that Ron was among the first members of the Airborne Division, the last D-Day veteran from their ranks on Teesside. Carl McGee, 44, who served in the Parachute Regiment from 1996 to 2010, said: “Many people in life have a hero to look up to. I was fortunate enough to have Ron Tucker. He was a true friend. “But most of all he was the beginnings of the regiment in which I had pleasure to serve. He was a man who loved and was, in turn, loved by anyone who ever met him. A true Airborne warrior.”  Rev Tyndall described Ron, who was a devoted husband to wife Dorothy and father to Peter and Ann, as a courageous man “right to the end”, a man with a big heart who loved his family very much. He added: “Ron fought for good.” In his memoir A Teenager’s War, Ron had told how his life was saved when one of four machine gun bullets that ripped through his uniform and pack hit a crucifix in his breast pocket. The bullet splintered on impact, narrowly missing two grenades. It was one of several lucky escapes for Ron, who was accompanied by the Daily Mirror when he made a pilgrimage to Normandy to remember his fallen comrades four years ago. Of the 450 Paras dropped into the Ranville area, only 150 survived and just 65 made it back home at the end of the war. In his book, Ron also told how he had dashed for cover as German troops ran to examine his parachute on D-Day. He recalled: “One had his jackboot so close to my nose I could smell the oily leather.” He pulled the pin of a grenade in readiness but the Germans moved off. Ron was awarded France’s highest medal, the Legion d’Honneur, for his heroics on D-Day and for his part in the Allied push to Berlin from 1944-1945. Before a bugler played Last Post from a gallery yesterday, ex-Para Joe Corfield, 80, told how his friend Ron had seen “more action than most of us put together”. He added: “He was a stunning, exceptional man, an inspiration.” By Jeremy Armstrong Tributes were paid today to a D-Day veteran whose friends had mistakenly attended his “funeral” 13 years ago. Former colleagues of Frank Hughes, 92, (pictured) turned up at the service for a namesake after a death notice appeared in 2005. Not long afterwards, one startled funeral-goer spotted Frank strolling around his hometown, Darlington, Co Durham. Born in Skegness, Frank enlisted at 18 and took part in the Juno beach landings of June 1944, helping hundreds of Canadian troops on to the beaches.   The father-of-two, who died earlier this week, once recalled: “All those young men who sacrificed everything for us.  We must always remember them.” After the war, Frank was in the Salvation Army, the fire brigade and drove an ambulance. In 2015, he received the Legion D’Honneur. His family said: “He will be greatly missed.” Details of the funeral are to be confirmed."},{"url":null,"title":"uber driver who posed selfie","story":"NewsUber driver who posed for selfie after raping drunk passenger in his taxi jailed for 12 years\u0027You have ruined her life,\u0027 judge blasts rapist Muhammad Durrani during sentencing\u0026nbspShareByTeilo ColleyStewart Carr18:26, 10 MAY 2018Updated18:28, 10 MAY 2018NewsMuhammed Durrani has been jailed for 12 years (Image: central news)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Uber driver who raped a drunk passenger in the back of his car before taking a selfie with her has been jailed for 12 years.

His victim had ordered an Uber with a friend\u0027s help, believing it to be a reputable company and fell asleep during the ride, according to the prosecution. Disorientated at her doorstep, she struggled to find her keys before Durrani carried her back to his car where he committed the rape. He then took selfie images with the woman as at least one of her breasts was exposed. Durrani, of Oakdale Road, Streatham, claimed the sex was consensual and denied one count of rape and one of assault by penetration, but a jury found him guilty of both. Wearing a brown cardigan, he remained solemn as he was sentenced but his wife struggled to hold back tears in the public gallery.

Unable to expand the relatively small number of grammars in England due to public opposition and a lost Parliamentary majority, Theresa May slipping the existing schools an extra \u0026pound50million is as sneaky as it is unfair. Excellent comprehensives under enormous financial strain deserve a cash boost too, as well as struggling schools which require a fresh start under a hew head. Today’s broadside from leaders of the giant National Education Union will be echoed at school gates and in staff rooms. Pupils, parents and teachers all know that squeezed funding is hurting bright kids. Schools in Wales and Scotland also receive a share of an education budget which isn’t large enough when student numbers are up. Distributing it fairly shouldn’t be hard but this Government doesn’t play fair. Pet Tory projects, are costing us what we can’t afford.  Risk to peace In a conflict-scarred Middle East the \u0026shymilitary exchanges between Israel and Iran could escalate to become \u0026shypotentially catastrophic.

Enough blood is spilled in Syria and Yemen. Adding to it with another Middle East war would create fresh human tragedies.

Two families merging seamlessly only happens in movies – boring ones at that. But despite any differences there’s always some common ground, right? Well, here’s the exception to the rule. In the red corner, Thomas Markle, aka just some bloke. In the blue, oh just His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, CC, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland.  Best of luck, Harry and Meghan. You are definitely going to need it.  A spot of DIY Maybe they’re not so different after all – Thomas popped to a DIY store in Rosarito, Mexico, to pick up a new toilet.  (Note to Thomas: “Hey, we all use them – am I right, Your Majesty?!”, is probably not the best conversation starter). Meanwhile, Charles showed that he wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty with essential maintenance work either.  He delicately turned his paintbrush to some perfumed, duck-shaped soap on a visit to the Parfumerie Fragonard laboratory in Eze, south eastern France. Toilet Duck, anyone? So, Thomas was busy with a lavatory while Charles was at a laboratory... so near, yet still pretty far. Family ties In these modern times, the best way to get to know someone is to Google them. So Thomas headed to an internet caf\u0026eacute – so 90s! – to do a bit of family research.  Hopefully, he studied the photo of Harry long and hard, so when he is walking his daughter down the aisle on May 19, he knows who to aim for. Meanwhile, Charles went to Greece, the birthplace of his father, Prince Philip.  At Piraeus harbour in Athens he visited HMC Valiant. But if he’d known internet cafes still existed, he probably would have just googled it instead. What\u0027s your poison The one thing that brings most people together is having a drink.  And there are positive signs that here, finally, is a genuine shared interest between Thomas and Charles. Kind of. Earlier this month, after dropping off several bags of washing at a launderette, Thomas went to a convenience store.  He picked up some cans of Heineken and a couple of packets of fags. Meanwhile, Prince Charles drank a drop of du vin rouge on a visit to Les Halles de Lyon – Paul Bocuse food market in Lyon, France. Quelle difference, eh? A nice meal out Is Thomas allowed a plus-one for the wedding? If so, maybe his fellow diner here will be the lucky lady...  Although, how could a lady get luckier than going to Peter Piper Pizza, complete with arcade games?  There were probably fewer arcade games where Charles got his grub on earlier this week – an official dinner at the Presidential Mansion with the President Of Greece – although not definitely. Suited and booted All that internet research seems to have paid off, because Thomas seems to understand he’s going to have to make some effort to scrub up before he meets his daughter’s intended’s folks.  Hard not to wish that he’s being measured for a wedding suit here – that red and white stripey material behind you looks like a winner to us, Thomas!  Meanwhile, Charles proves with this outfit (above) that he’s a dab hand at accessorising, and not afraid of a brooch or two.

But if all this seems like too much of a faff, you can now just hire professional bridesmaids and groomsmen.   A new job advert has gone up on the online service marketplace bark for people to take up the role, and it claims experts can earn up yo \u0026pound100 an hour.  It states professional bridesmaids aren\u0027t just for people who have no friends, but are appealing for engaged couples who want an expert there to make sure everything runs smoothly. Duties include running errands, managing timings and organising hen and stag dos.  Bark co-founder Kai Feller said:   We know professional bridesmaids and groomsmen are already popular with couples in the States for a variety of reasons.

Anyone living within 3 miles of Mount Merapi, which is situated on the densely-populated Java Island, has been evacuated. The huge volcano, which stands at 18,000ft tall, previously erupted in 2010 in a series of eruptions that killed 350 people. The disaster mitigation agency told residents living within the exclusion zone to find shelter.  Around 120 people who had been hiking on Merapi have also been safely evacuated, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. The airport in Yogyakarta, the nearest big city to the volcano, shut because of the threat from the ash, the state-owned aviation agency AirNav said.  It is not known yet if the volcanic eruption will have any further impact on air travel. The disaster agency described Merapi\u0027s latest eruption as phreatic, which means magma heats up ground water and vapour is released under pressure.  The alert status on Merapi had not be raised, it said.  The emergency response comes after thousands were ordered to leave their homes following an eruption of Kilauea on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island .

We were both only 18 and we didn’t have the money for that.“The ceremony took place at 8.30am because it was the day of the students’ charity event when they would decorate floats and parade them around the city so all the streets were closing.“After the wedding ceremony, we went back to my mum and dad’s house for a small wedding breakfast before heading to the Palace Theatre and then the carnival.“On our wedding night we went home and our best man, my cousin David Cunningham, made us stovies.“It wasn’t a grand day and we definitely couldn’t afford a honeymoon but it was fantastic.“Although all the pictures are black and white, I remember John’s suit being a powder blue colour.”In the image seen here, the young girl gifting the happy couple a traditional horseshoe is Mary’s cousin June Kay, who is now 66 herself.Mary, a retired teacher, and John, a retired roofer, have two sons, Stephen and John, as well as six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.It was one of their grandchildren who inspired Mary’s gift to John for their diamond anniversary.Mary said: “My granddaughter had asked why John never wore a wedding ring and the answer was he never had one to wear!“We were lucky to have been able to buy my wedding ring but John never got one.“For my gift to him this year, I bought him a gold wedding band which he now wears.“He bought me a dozen yellow roses but was shocked at the price of 12 flowers!”During their anniversary celebrations, the couple were visited at their Broughty Ferry home by Lord Provost Ian Borthwick who presented them with a bouquet of flowers and they also received a card of congratulation from the Queen.John said: “It has been 60 good years of happiness, laughter and banter.

defence, though, held firm.Neil added: “I thought we defended magnificently well in the second half as they threw everything at it.
