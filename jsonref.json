She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/12/4D5C0CF100000578-5860369-image-m-57_1529406174400.jpg","title":"Princess Dianas former butler Paul Burrell blasts palace Thomas Markle interview","story":"Paul Burrell (pictured on Good Morning Britain today) said that the royal family has the \u0027biggest PR machine in the world\u0027 but still doesn\u0027t look after \u0027outsiders\u0027          Princess Diana\u0027s former butler has blasted the royals today for failing to protect Thomas Markle (pictured) following his bombshell interview\u0027It\u0027s another bombshell blindsiding the palace\u0027, he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.\u0027It\u0027s extraordinary that Meghan and Harry didn\u0027t know this was going to take place.

It was, Harry Kane said, ‘what dreams are made of. I’m so proud. We fought to the end.\u0027‘Obviously you get such a good feeling with any goal you score. But to score a winner in a World Cup is just incredible. The celebrations — and watching the celebrations back home and in the stadium — incredible.‘I have been part of that before when I was a kid watching football — to see it and be part of it was amazing.’He is also not one to let the fact that England’s display was the most-watched television programme this year — a peak audience of 18.3 million saw it on BBC One, more than the 13.1 million peak for the Royal wedding — go to his head.Kane’s gentlemanly values and unabashed patriotism — witness his full-throated rendition of the national anthem before Monday’s match — certainly bring to mind Bobby Moore, his most illustrious predecessor as England captain.High and dry! Panic for football fans as Moscow faces...Female sports reporter bravely carries on presenting as...Share this articleHere is a man so thoroughly decent that he once spent two hours signing autographs in the car park after training with his club, Tottenham Hotspur. Why? Because, as he says, he was once a Spurs fan himself, and remembers how it felt to be snubbed by one’s idols.This is a global superstar who still returns to watch his school football team who represents a charity that preserves London’s green open spaces speaks out with concern against childhood obesity spurns nightclubs for the simple pleasure of a family meal at his local curry house in Essex, where a member of staff yesterday told the Mail how he had ‘thrilled’ her son with the gift of a signed football.In interviews, Kane — not even born when Bobby Moore died in 1993 — says he was inspired by two past England captains when making his way in the game: Wayne Rooney (who, somewhat ironically, gave him advice on the company he should keep) and David Beckham, who hails from the same East London manor, and attended the same school.However, Google the names Rooney and Beckham along with ‘scandal’ and you will find all manner of lurid allegations, playing away from home being the common denominator.Do the same with Kane and one finds only one slur: that he once teased Liverpool supporters over a dubious penalty decision.When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celeb.          When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celebBy way of his heritage, Kane might easily have played for Ireland had that country’s football association been quick enough to spot his potential.His late maternal grandfather, Michael John Kane, a talented footballer whom he credits for his ‘sporting genes’, was from Connemara, and Harry still has cousins in County Galway, two of whom are locally famous as singers, the Kane Sisters.However, when remembering his less-than-smooth rise to the top of the game, he thanks his parents, Pat, 54, and Kim, 51, who encouraged him unstintingly and were invariably on the touchline when he played for his school and local team, Ridgeway Rovers. There is praise, too, for his elder brother, Charlie, 29.It was his father who kept Kane from aping many of his England teammates and covering himself in tattoos. He once said, ‘My dad would never let me. I used to want some, but Dad always told me I would regret it when I was older.’Neighbours have recalled them as a close-knit family and one remembered: ‘We used to see him carrying the goal posts with his brother to the park. One of the brothers was taller and the posts used to travel up the road at an angle.’Like Moore, the young Kane lacked pace. He was so slow, in fact, that Frank Lampard Senior — who watched him train — suggested he buy running spikes and practise sprinting. (Kane mistakenly bought javelin-throwing shoes, and had to send them back.)Though he now stands at a sinewy 6ft 2in, he was also quite small and slight, and had to bulk up in the gym.Kane was clever enough to pass his GCSEs, and according to his former PE teacher at Chingford Foundation School, Mark Leadon, he ‘put his head down and worked hard at everything he did’.Nevertheless, he set his mind on becoming a footballer from an early age, and was determined to make the most of his talent.At 11, however, he was rejected by Arsenal’s academy and had a spell with Watford before being signed by Spurs. Then, in his teens, there came more setbacks. While other starlets were breaking into the first team, he was loaned to teams such as Leyton Orient and Millwall, where he fought tooth and nail to prove himself and gain his chance in the Premiership.Among Tottenham’s fans, it has made local boy Kane a folk hero. ‘Harry Kane, he’s one of our own,’ they sing proudly. As for female supporters, ignoring his longstanding relationship — not to mention his slight lisp and strong Essex diction — many declare their undying love for him.‘What a heart-breaker!’ cooed one devoted fan on Twitter.          Kate also shared an image of Ivy in an England shirt with Kane’s shirt number, 9, on the back, with the caption ‘Let’s go Daddy!! #worldcup2018’‘I’d marry him tomorrow,’ was another typical comment. As children, he and Kate lived ten minutes’ walk from one another, but they only began dating in 2011 after being friends for years.With her bottle-blonde hair and perma-tan, a taste for fashionable clothes and brightly-coloured bikinis, plus a growing army of Instagram followers, she may seem, at first blush, the archetypal WAG.But Kate is no Coleen Rooney or Victoria Beckham, say insiders rather she’s a modest, low-key young woman who prefers to spend evenings at home with Harry, watching movies, rather than go out on the town.Nonetheless, her lifestyle has changed considerably since she and her boyfriend had dates at Lee Valley cinema, followed by fish and chips.The couple make no secret of their love for the finer things in life, posting snaps of their exotic holidays online, and they have a fleet of three luxury cars: a limited edition Bentley Continental GT Supersports costing an eye-watering £233,800, a Jaguar F-Pace, and a Range Rover Autobiography.Like many top footballers, Kane supplements his £10 million-a-year salary with lucrative endorsements. He has appeared in commercials for Mars bars, and Beats By Dre headphones.In a sign that he is ready to raise his profile beyond the confines of football, we also saw him at this year’s Brit Awards, where he gave out the Best Solo Artist award. Then again, even unassuming Bobby Moore wasn’t averse to doing the occasional TV ad.Of course, whether Kane can emulate Moore’s feats in 1966 is quite another matter.But if and when England are knocked out of the tournament, one thing seems guaranteed: there will be no histrionics from the captain. No Gazza-style weeping in full public view.‘The last time I cried was a long time ago. I don’t really cry at films or anything like that,’ says Kane, surmising that it was probably in 2004, when, as a ten-year-old boy, he watched Portugal eliminate the national team from the European Championships.In fact, he admits, Kate was upset with him because he failed to shed a tear at the birth of their daughter.But then, that’s England’s new Captain Marvel. He may be a New Age Man, he may be a true gent — but he certainly isn’t a cissy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/21/4D6BE61500000578-5862671-image-m-80_1529441650477.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle channels Audrey Hepburn Fair Lady outing Ascot","story":"    Wearing a black and white hat by another new favourite, Philip Treacy, Meghan gave a modern twist to a famous outfit from the Hollywood musical          In My Fair Lady, Cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle – played by Audrey Hepburn (above) – wears a frilly white gown with black and white bows and matching hat      Get it right in white like the Duchess of Sussex in GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy white shirt dressShop the current collection at NET-A-PORTERThe Duchess of Sussex was looking her usual chic self for her Royal Ascot debut today, wearing another look by Givenchy.

For now, you should register your phone number with the Telephone Preference Service online at tpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0345 070 0707.Once your number is on this list it is illegal for companies to cold call and try to sell you something.If caught, firms face a fine of up to £500,000 by the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.However, signing up won\u0027t stop all nuisance calls.

Check with our pension calculator    Criminal gangs  are scanning newspapers and websites for notices about deathsFraudsters are duping grieving widows out of their life savings by claiming to be clairvoyants who will contact their loved ones for a fee.Criminal gangs based overseas are scanning newspapers and websites for notices about deaths. They then ring widows and widowers or send them letters offering to help them speak to their dead spouse in return for a charge of between £10 and £50. In one case, a widow in her 70s received 15 such scam letters a week from crooks offering to contact her husband. Each time she would send £10 to £40 to the scammers — most of her disposable income — before Trading Standards intervened. Criminals sometimes also claim to be able to give victims winning lottery numbers, or offer to remove a curse.Anyone who receives a letter or call from someone claiming to be a clairvoyant should ignore it or report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.r.lythe@dailymail.co.uk                                                    Sky customers can sign up for its free Talk Shield service — but you must have both a landline and internet with the firm.This requires callers to state their name and where they are calling from before they can be put through. Then, instead of your phone just ringing, you will be played their message so you can decide if you want to pick up.If you don\u0027t want to answer you can refuse the call and put the number on your block list. Friends and family can be added to a list of safe callers so they will get through every time.For the service to work, you must have a home phone which displays the numbers of callers on a screen.TalkTalk offers its customers a similar service called CallSafe.It has a national database of known unwanted callers that it blocks from getting through, and you can add further numbers to the list.It also offers a service that will reject calls from anyone who withholds their number.TalkTalk automatically creates a list of approved callers from your regularly dialled numbers so friends and family members can get straight through.You may want to invest in a standalone call-blocking gadget such as a trueCall device.This is a small plastic device that plugs in between your phone and the wall socket.It also intercepts calls to request that the caller states their name before being put through, and you can add numbers to a block or safe list.If the caller refuses to state their name, your phone won\u0027t even ring as they will be blocked automatically.Trading Standards has a small number of these gadgets to give away for free, so call your local council to see if you qualify.          Fight back: Many major telecoms companies now offer their own call blocking services. If you are with BT, you can sign up for BT Protect    Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027 free of charge.If you have an iPhone, hold your finger on the message until a menu pops up.Select \u0027more\u0027 and then look for the blue arrow in the bottom right hand side of your screen.Then enter the number 7726 and click send.You can also block the number so you do not receive any more messages.There\u0027s a blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 in it for information on the top right of the screen, within the nuisance message. Tap this, then the grey arrow in the top right — the list of options will include the choice to \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also report text messages online to the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office at ico.org.uk or by calling 0303 123 1113.The watchdog will ask you a series of questions such as what the text was about, whether you had a previous relationship with the firm that contacted you, and if the message worried you.You do not have to answer all the questions, but the more detail you can give the better.You can also report nuisance calls this way.However, scammers typically use multiple numbers so it\u0027s difficult to stop all spam texts from getting through.Many junk texts include an option to reply \u0027STOP\u0027 to prevent further messages. If you do so the company is legally required to stop sending marketing texts.But only do this if you are sure the message is from a legitimate company, such as your mobile provider or another firm you have dealt with in the past.If you are in any doubt, ignore it. Replying just confirms to the firm that your phone is active and they may hound you all the more or sell your number on to other crooks.Watch out for messages that appear to come from your bank or the taxman.Fraudsters are able to make it appear as though their text messages have been sent from a legitimate company.These spoof messages are often very convincing because they appear in the same thread as other genuine texts.To be safe, never click on any link or call a number given to you in an unexpected text message — even if it claims your account has been suspended or blocked.If you have any concerns call the phone number on the back of your bank card or statement.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs says it will never contact taxpayers about refunds or request personal details by text message.It advises people to forward any suspicious messages to 60599 (there may be a small charge if you do not have free text messages as part of your contract).                                                    If you think the call was from a fraudster, report it to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk, or by phoning 0300 123 2040. Blocking phone numbers on a smartphone is also easy. If you have an iPhone, for example, tap on the green square icon with a picture of a phone to pull up your recent calls list.There will be a little blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 for information next to the nuisance caller\u0027s number.Tap on this, scroll to the bottom of the list of options and select \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also download the free TPS Protect app which will help identify different types of nuisance calls.If a number is in the app\u0027s database because it\u0027s been reported by another user, a message will pop up telling you what type of company is calling.For example, it might say \u0027insurance\u0027 or \u0027PPI\u0027. It will also tell you if the number is a \u0027suspected scam\u0027. You can then reject the call and use your phone\u0027s settings to block it for ever.You can also report numbers by filling out a few details on the app, which will help other users. Details of reported calls will be passed on to the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.The app also gives telephone numbers a \u0027trust score\u0027 of between one and five, where one is likely to be a scam and five a company with a low number of complaints.But these are not always accurate so stay vigilant.For 99p a month you can add numbers to an automatic block list so that your phone doesn\u0027t ring when they call.But remember, you can already do this for free as we explain above. With the more advanced version of the app you can also choose only to accept calls above a certain trust score.The app can\u0027t identify calls that come from a withheld number.Instead, you may want to decline them so they are erted to your voicemail.moneymail@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/00/4D6CBEFC00000578-5862983-image-m-26_1529449404758.jpg","title":"Adorable moment Lucy Dog Gus Dolphin strike unlikely friendship","story":"    A Rottweiler-Husky mix named Lucy is seen aboard her owner\u0027s charter boat befriending a dolphin named Gus           The  dolphin swims up next to the boat sailing from Captive Island, Florida, and gets Lucy\u0027s attentionShe posted the video titled \u0027Lucy and her friend\u0027 to Facebook, which has garnered more than 350,000 views since it was taken last month. In an interview with Naples Daily News, Gilchrist said Lucy has been coming on board since she was six months old. \u0027She\u0027s my best friend,\u0027 he added. Gilchrist even takes Lucy on his fishing excursions up to five days a week.  Wet and woof!

Sir Paul\u0027s home is separated from the two homes and is not involved Her barrister, Stuart Frame, claims that the Party Wall Award should be overturned as the wall in question is not actually shared.\u0027It is Mrs Fenton\u0027s case that the works authorised by the award cannot be executed due to the fact that the configuration of the walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works are not as assumed by the surveyor making the award,\u0027 he said.Mr and Mrs Lewis say their neighbour should not be allowed to argue that the wall is hers alone, claiming she agreed informally through solicitors 21 years ago that the boundary runs down the middle of the wall.She then stood by \u0027in silence\u0027 while the original extension was built off the wall, Mr Rainey told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.Much of her case also referred to the plan which contains the allegedly fraudulent annotations, indicating that Mrs Fenton owns the whole wall.\u0027The current proposed extension is by way of compliance with the order in 2015, requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to replace the roof of their extension,\u0027 said Mr Rainey.\u0027The judge was told that if the roof had to come off, the opportunity would be taken to build the additional storey.\u0027Mrs Fenton has done everything in her power, including issuing these proceedings, to interfere with Mr and Mrs Lewis\u0027 attempts to comply with that order.\u0027The judge reserved his decision on the case until a later date."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/13/4D7038CF00000578-5865075-image-a-52_1529497473032.jpg","title":"Shed converted pub bar fruit machine 200","story":"    Wayne Hyland (pictured), from West Drayton, west London, has transformed his garden shed into a fully functioning pub          The 43-year-old HGV driver spent six months and £200 converting the structure into a cosy \u0027pub shed\u0027 - which he calls \u0027Lenny\u0027s Bar\u0027          \u0027People said I was crazy when I said what I wanted to accomplish with my tiny shed.

It\u0027s everyone\u0027s dream to have a pub in the bottom of their garden.\u0027It is a haven for me after a long day driving to just be able to grab a beer and relax. We save a lot of taxi money, as we can stagger a few metres home.          Mr Hyland (pictured outside Lenny\u0027s Bar last week) built his pub shed all by himself.

Pictured is a graffiti artist painting a Tube train in London          The \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 tagged this train and others in the street art community have said this is the \u0027holy grail\u0027  A new photograph shows Loughborough Junction victim Harrison Scott-Hood riding a bike along a railway line apparently carrying his spray cans (left). Criminologist Nicola Harding (right) says graffiti artists are now using social media like Instagram to gain notoriety  Leeds Trinity University criminologist Nicola Harding, who has spent years studying graffiti artists in Britain and around the world, has said that street art is increasingly becoming a pursuit for the wealthy middle classes using social media like Instagram to gain notoriety          This is the final piece of graffiti painted on the night the \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 known as K-Bag, Lover and Trip died just 350 yards from where they were all run down and killed by the same train          The final hours of their lives have started to emerge as it appears they walked up the railway line and were killed close to their final artwork togetherThe three young men killed at Loughborough Junctions were spraying graffiti on a bridge where they had no hope of escaping trains.All were from respectable homes and either worked full time or were students. Nicola Harding said: \u0027From my research it does appear that those who are engaging in graffiti are increasingly now from more affluent backgrounds, as they have the money and time to devote to perfecting their skills.\u0027In the 1980-90s graffiti writers would have usually started by stealing paint from car workshops. Spray paint is now kept caged if on the high street, and is more often than not sold online. This is quite expensive and requires a certain level of disposable income to be graffiti writing regularly\u0027. She added: \u0027Instagram is a good way for graffiti writers to show off their graffiti skills, and identify with the culture. By using wild style graffiti or showing spray cans and masks, they can hone the craft of graffiti without getting arrested, but are still part of the graffiti culture\u0027. Final graffiti tags of \u0027Lover, K-Bag and Trip\u0027 painted just...Husband shoots dead his wife and her father before killing...Grieving families call for GP \u0027responsible for HUNDREDS of...Full steam ahead!

The thing writers go to jail for is trains, so you\u0027re seeing a lot of people up on the street now\u0027. MailOnline today revealed  the final piece of graffiti painted on the night the so-called \u0027Three Musketeers\u0027 died just 350 yards from where they were all run down. The friends walked along a stretch of line close to Brixton Station and did a \u0027hang over\u0027 on a bridge - where you lean over the side to paint - in what friends have called their \u0027final mission\u0027 hours before they died.Paying tribute to his friend Harrison a former schoolmate said: \u0027He was an amazing human being, a kind-hearted and generous person, someone with an infectious laugh and smile, and a man with infinite wisdom, who worked hard and paid his dues to society. There is so much more to him than the catastrophe that ensued on Sunday night, and this, first and foremost, must be remembered\u0027.He added: \u0027Graffiti is an infectious and often untreatable bug, for some, no matter how much you try to shake it, it remains a part of your life no matter how many run-ins with the law. Those in the graffiti community do not seek for you to understand why they do it, but simply to comprehend that there is far more to these graffiti artists than meets the eye\u0027.   The parents of Alberto Fresneda Carrasco (pictured left and right) said today that they had last heard from their son, a keen Everton and Sevilla fan, on Sunday night at 10pm saying he would be coming home for dinner - but he never arrived  The final victim was 23-year-old Jack Gilbert, nicknamed K-Bag, whose work is on walls and trains (pictured) all over LondonA privately educated fine arts student and a teenage photographer were among three graffiti artists killed by a train.The body of Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, known as Harry, was found close to those of his two friends on a busy South London railway line on Monday morning.The budding artist from Muswell Hill, who attended £7,000-a-term Hampstead Fine Arts College, was a well-known figure in the capital\u0027s underground graffiti scene.Known by his tag \u0027Lover\u0027, he had been commissioned to undertake professional graffiti murals for firms.The \u0027Three Musketeer\u0027 graffiti artists killed by a train at a notorious and \u0027dangerous\u0027 vandalism hotspot were named by their \u0027heartbroken\u0027 parents on Tuesday.Mr Scott-Hood, whose mother Susie is a successful painter and art agent, was found dead alongside 19-year-old Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, who was known as Trip and also lived in north London.The final victim was Jack Gilbert, a 23-year-old nicknamed K-Bag, and all three friends are believed to have been hit by an out of service passenger train shortly after 1am as they painted on walls in south London after dark.  Alberto\u0027s father Carlos is the UK correspondent of Spanish daily and his parents said today that they had last heard from their son, a keen Everton and Sevilla fan from Hampstead, on Sunday night at 10pm saying he would be coming home for dinner - but he never arrived.

It beggars belief.\u0027He continued: \u0027The properties that were bought by RBKC were bought without a fire risk assessment being carried out.\u0027When residents were shown the properties, they weren\u0027t told that they hadn\u0027t been fire risk assessed.\u0027Mr Daffarn said the lack of fire risk assessment was just one example of social housing tenants being treated with indifference by RBKC.He blamed the toxic relationship between RBKC and its tenants on a \u0027cabal\u0027 of senior officers for systematically asset-stripping the borough because it was a \u0027gold mine\u0027.He added: \u0027RBKC (council) was a property development company masquerading as a local authority.\u0027They failed to keep us safe because they had higher priorities - the priorities were getting us off the land.\u0027The tenant management organisation in charge of the tower has now been dissolved, but Mr Daffarn voiced his concern that a number of its officers had simply been absorbed into the employment of the council.          Kensington and Chelsea Council leader Elizabeth Campbell and chief executive Barry Quirk arrive at Portcullis House in Westminster, London\u0027What are the council doing to monitor the performance of the council that came from Kensington and Chelsea Tennant Management Organisation?\u0027 he asked.Jacqui Haynes, chairwoman of the Lancaster West Residents Association, said: \u0027This is years of disempowerment, years of being looked upon as if we don\u0027t matter.\u0027We have been suffering this level of service, this kind of treatment for years -decades.\u0027It\u0027s just because this disaster happened that it blew up in their (the council\u0027s) faces and they realised that it can\u0027t continue.\u0027Mr Daffarn criticised the Government for failing to place the council into special measures immediately after the fire.\u0027There\u0027s a vast chasm between the council and the community which at the least will take many, many years to rebuild,\u0027 he said.RBKC chief executive Barry Quirk - who was appointed in the aftermath of the disaster - said they were now examining council staff\u0027s \u0027cultural competencies\u0027 and not just their experience, and that the £50 million budget allocated to help survivors of the fire matched that of the children\u0027s social services department.\u0027Turning around an organisation like (RBKC) does take time and we need to evaluate the competencies of managers, we need to change some frontline staff and we need to monitor delivery,\u0027 he said.Council leader Elizabeth Campbell thanked the victims for the way they have treated councillors in the wake of the fire.\u0027I think the way survivors and bereaved have treated us is nothing short of amazing - there has been unbelievable generosity of spirit,\u0027 she said.\u0027If my child had died, would I be talking to the council like that? The answer is probably not.\u0027Both Ms Campbell and Mr Quirk said they were committed to reforming attitudes within the council, but Mr Quirk estimated it would be many years before he was satisfied with the levels of empathy among staff for social housing tenants."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/16/4D6B731900000578-5866075-image-a-27_1529509074384.jpg","title":"How split families history","story":"  Children at the Weill public school in San Francisco recite the Pledge of Allegiance.

Muranaga, whose family was interned at Granada Relocation Center in Colorado, joined the U.S. Army but was killed in Italy. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton.   Slavery Before abolition, children of black slaves were born into slavery and could be sold by owners at will. Black women could do little to stop the sale of children and often never saw them again after they were sent away.  Visitors file past the sculpture of a slave girl, one out of 40 statues spread about the grounds, titled, \u0027Children of Whitney,\u0027 by Woodrow Nash, inside the Antioch Baptist Church, at the Whitney Plantation in Edgard, LA          Black women could do little to stop the sale of children and often never saw them again after they were sent away. Pictured: Slaves on a plantation on Edisto Island in South Carolina, 1862Owners also split apart parents who had no legal rights to prevent their sale. To resist, slave families regularly ran away together but faced harsh physical punishment, even death, if caught by slave hunters.Last week, both White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Attorney Jeff Sessions cited the Bible in defending the policy of forced separation of Latino migrant children. Sessions referenced Romans 13, which urges readers \u0027to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order.\u0027 The same passage was cited before the Civil War to justify slavery, to allow slave hunters to return runaway slaves to their owners and to pull slave children away from mothers.Native American boarding schoolsAfter the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, when the Army slaughtered 150 Lakota men, women and children in the last chapter of America\u0027s long Indian wars, authorities forced Native American families to send their children to government- or church-run boarding schools. The objective, as Carlisle Indian Industrial School founder Capt. Richard H. Pratt put it, was to \u0027kill the Indian in him and save the man.\u0027  Millie Friday, a descendent of Little Plume, a Native American student who was taken from his family and forced to go to boarding school, is comforted by Barbara Andrews-Christy of Circle Legacy Center, as Aílice Hall looks during a gathering on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, in Carlisle, PA  A gravesite of Herbert Littlehawk at the cemetery at the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, PA. Littlehawk, an American Indian student who was taken from his family, is buried at the siteAt 150 or so Indian schools around the country, officials made Native American children cut their hair and outlawed all Native American languages. They forced children to adopt Christianity and attempted to \u0027Americanize\u0027 children by introducing them to white customs and white history.Native American children returned home almost unrecognizable to their parents.Still, some children resisted the boarding school experience by setting fires to buildings, running away or taking their own lives. Others continued to speak their native language in secret.Some Navajo \u0027code talkers,\u0027 who used a code based on their native language to transmit messages in World War II, were products of military-style boarding schools as children.Poverty During the early 1900s, states sometimes pulled children from poor families and placed them in orphanages.           Malcolm X in his autobiography recalled welfare workers coming to take him and his siblings away as children from his struggling single motherBut reformers in the 1920s and 1930s began promoting the idea that children should not be separated from their families, according to \u0027In the Shadow Of the Poorhouse: A Social History Of Welfare In America\u0027 by Michael B. Katz.However, local and state authorities still used poverty as a reason to take children away from Native American and black families, National Association of Social Workers CEO Angelo McClain said. Sometimes the ordered separation came over concerns about a parent\u0027s mental health.Malcolm X in his autobiography recalled welfare workers coming to take him and his siblings away as children from his struggling single mother after their father, an outspoken black preacher, was mysteriously murdered. The future civil rights leader lived in various foster homes and boarding houses. His mother, without her children, had a breakdown and was sent to a mental institution.Immigration During the Great Depression, local authorities in California and Texas participated in a mass deportation of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans whom they blamed for the economic downturn. Between 500,000 and 1 million Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans were pushed out of the country during the 1930s repatriation, as the removal is sometimes called.          During the Great Depression (pictured are men outside the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 after the market crash), local authorities in California and Texas participated in a mass deportation of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans whom they blamed for the economic downturnSome families hid children away from relatives in the U.S. to prevent them from being sent to a foreign country they had never visited, according to Francisco Balderrama, a Chicano studies professor at California State University-Los Angeles and co-author of \u0027Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s.\u0027Many families felt they were being forced to separate from their children, who were U.S. citizens.\u0027And many children,\u0027 Balderrama said, \u0027never saw their parents again.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/05/4D6F47BB00000578-0-image-m-99_1529469189964.jpg","title":"New Zealand rocked powerful 4 7 magnitude earthquake residents report shaking homes","story":"    New Zealand has been rocked by a strong 4.7 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday night within five kilometres of Te Kaha in the Bay of PlentyUsers took to social media to comment about the earthquake and advising residents to stay safe. \u0027We felt the Te Kaha 4.7 quake an hour ago.

The incident sparked protests in London with furious people calling for answers in the wake of Mr Charles\u0027 death Asked why he had not asked Mr Charles if he was choking, or deemed him to be an immediate medical emergency and called an ambulance, BX47 said: \u0027That would probably be that I was not aware he was choking.\u0027He was not exhibiting the signs I would have been looking for, which all made the situation harder to gauge.\u0027His fellow officer, who was referred to only as BX48, said she arrived on the scene shortly after BX47 had called for back-up and found Mr Charles was still breathing and had a pulse.The qualified police medic, who is working on full duties, said she would not have done anything differently, after using an oropharyngeal airway - a plastic tube - to try and help Mr Charles breathe before starting CPR.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) took no further action against one officer after considering a common assault charge following a referral from the IOPC.Mr Charles\u0027 family said they have asked the CPS to review the decision. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/17/4D548C0800000578-5866269-Yoga_has_surged_dramatically_in_popularity_across_Western_nation-a-41_1529512477752.jpg","title":"International Yoga Day 2018 need know","story":"    International Yoga Day was established by the United Nations back in December 2014 to promote awareness of the ancient practice and recognize its contributions across the worldWhat is International Yoga Day?International Yoga Day is a global event that raises awareness throughout the world of the benefits of practicing yoga.The idea for International Yoga Day was first proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 2014 United Nations General Assembly address.Modi stated: ‘Yoga is an invaluable gift of India\u0027s ancient tradition.

It was, Harry Kane said, ‘what dreams are made of. I’m so proud. We fought to the end.\u0027‘Obviously you get such a good feeling with any goal you score. But to score a winner in a World Cup is just incredible. The celebrations — and watching the celebrations back home and in the stadium — incredible.‘I have been part of that before when I was a kid watching football — to see it and be part of it was amazing.’He is also not one to let the fact that England’s display was the most-watched television programme this year — a peak audience of 18.3 million saw it on BBC One, more than the 13.1 million peak for the Royal wedding — go to his head.Kane’s gentlemanly values and unabashed patriotism — witness his full-throated rendition of the national anthem before Monday’s match — certainly bring to mind Bobby Moore, his most illustrious predecessor as England captain.High and dry! Panic for football fans as Moscow faces...Female sports reporter bravely carries on presenting as...Share this articleHere is a man so thoroughly decent that he once spent two hours signing autographs in the car park after training with his club, Tottenham Hotspur. Why? Because, as he says, he was once a Spurs fan himself, and remembers how it felt to be snubbed by one’s idols.This is a global superstar who still returns to watch his school football team who represents a charity that preserves London’s green open spaces speaks out with concern against childhood obesity spurns nightclubs for the simple pleasure of a family meal at his local curry house in Essex, where a member of staff yesterday told the Mail how he had ‘thrilled’ her son with the gift of a signed football.In interviews, Kane — not even born when Bobby Moore died in 1993 — says he was inspired by two past England captains when making his way in the game: Wayne Rooney (who, somewhat ironically, gave him advice on the company he should keep) and David Beckham, who hails from the same East London manor, and attended the same school.However, Google the names Rooney and Beckham along with ‘scandal’ and you will find all manner of lurid allegations, playing away from home being the common denominator.Do the same with Kane and one finds only one slur: that he once teased Liverpool supporters over a dubious penalty decision.When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celeb.          When it comes to romance, Harry is strictly a one-woman man. In his teens, he began dating Kate Goodland, an apple-cheeked fitness instructor whom he has known since primary school, and says he could never countenance going out with a lingerie model or C-list celebBy way of his heritage, Kane might easily have played for Ireland had that country’s football association been quick enough to spot his potential.His late maternal grandfather, Michael John Kane, a talented footballer whom he credits for his ‘sporting genes’, was from Connemara, and Harry still has cousins in County Galway, two of whom are locally famous as singers, the Kane Sisters.However, when remembering his less-than-smooth rise to the top of the game, he thanks his parents, Pat, 54, and Kim, 51, who encouraged him unstintingly and were invariably on the touchline when he played for his school and local team, Ridgeway Rovers. There is praise, too, for his elder brother, Charlie, 29.It was his father who kept Kane from aping many of his England teammates and covering himself in tattoos. He once said, ‘My dad would never let me. I used to want some, but Dad always told me I would regret it when I was older.’Neighbours have recalled them as a close-knit family and one remembered: ‘We used to see him carrying the goal posts with his brother to the park. One of the brothers was taller and the posts used to travel up the road at an angle.’Like Moore, the young Kane lacked pace. He was so slow, in fact, that Frank Lampard Senior — who watched him train — suggested he buy running spikes and practise sprinting. (Kane mistakenly bought javelin-throwing shoes, and had to send them back.)Though he now stands at a sinewy 6ft 2in, he was also quite small and slight, and had to bulk up in the gym.Kane was clever enough to pass his GCSEs, and according to his former PE teacher at Chingford Foundation School, Mark Leadon, he ‘put his head down and worked hard at everything he did’.Nevertheless, he set his mind on becoming a footballer from an early age, and was determined to make the most of his talent.At 11, however, he was rejected by Arsenal’s academy and had a spell with Watford before being signed by Spurs. Then, in his teens, there came more setbacks. While other starlets were breaking into the first team, he was loaned to teams such as Leyton Orient and Millwall, where he fought tooth and nail to prove himself and gain his chance in the Premiership.Among Tottenham’s fans, it has made local boy Kane a folk hero. ‘Harry Kane, he’s one of our own,’ they sing proudly. As for female supporters, ignoring his longstanding relationship — not to mention his slight lisp and strong Essex diction — many declare their undying love for him.‘What a heart-breaker!’ cooed one devoted fan on Twitter.          Kate also shared an image of Ivy in an England shirt with Kane’s shirt number, 9, on the back, with the caption ‘Let’s go Daddy!! #worldcup2018’‘I’d marry him tomorrow,’ was another typical comment. As children, he and Kate lived ten minutes’ walk from one another, but they only began dating in 2011 after being friends for years.With her bottle-blonde hair and perma-tan, a taste for fashionable clothes and brightly-coloured bikinis, plus a growing army of Instagram followers, she may seem, at first blush, the archetypal WAG.But Kate is no Coleen Rooney or Victoria Beckham, say insiders rather she’s a modest, low-key young woman who prefers to spend evenings at home with Harry, watching movies, rather than go out on the town.Nonetheless, her lifestyle has changed considerably since she and her boyfriend had dates at Lee Valley cinema, followed by fish and chips.The couple make no secret of their love for the finer things in life, posting snaps of their exotic holidays online, and they have a fleet of three luxury cars: a limited edition Bentley Continental GT Supersports costing an eye-watering £233,800, a Jaguar F-Pace, and a Range Rover Autobiography.Like many top footballers, Kane supplements his £10 million-a-year salary with lucrative endorsements. He has appeared in commercials for Mars bars, and Beats By Dre headphones.In a sign that he is ready to raise his profile beyond the confines of football, we also saw him at this year’s Brit Awards, where he gave out the Best Solo Artist award. Then again, even unassuming Bobby Moore wasn’t averse to doing the occasional TV ad.Of course, whether Kane can emulate Moore’s feats in 1966 is quite another matter.But if and when England are knocked out of the tournament, one thing seems guaranteed: there will be no histrionics from the captain. No Gazza-style weeping in full public view.‘The last time I cried was a long time ago. I don’t really cry at films or anything like that,’ says Kane, surmising that it was probably in 2004, when, as a ten-year-old boy, he watched Portugal eliminate the national team from the European Championships.In fact, he admits, Kate was upset with him because he failed to shed a tear at the birth of their daughter.But then, that’s England’s new Captain Marvel. He may be a New Age Man, he may be a true gent — but he certainly isn’t a cissy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/21/00D6577600000578-0-image-m-5_1529439800292.jpg","title":"How block infuriating phone pests","story":"    Menace: Britons were bombarded with 3.9 billion nuisance phone calls and text messages last yearA ban on cold calls is coming, but don\u0027t expect it to mean the end of phone pests. Pensions conmen and claims firms are already finding ways to beat the new rules.Here, our helpful guide shows how to take matters into your own hands and protect yourself against nuisance calls.Stop Pesky Phone Calls At Home  Britons were bombarded with 3.9 billion nuisance phone calls and text messages last year — the equivalent of 7,420 every minute, according to watchdog Ofcom.The Government has pledged to introduce a law by the end of the month that will ban cold calls about pensions. This means that firms will no longer be permitted to ring people at home out of the blue and convince them to transfer their pension money into risky investments.Ministers have also promised to crack down on nuisance calls from claims management companies.But no one knows when all these new rules will come into force. For now, you should register your phone number with the Telephone Preference Service online at tpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0345 070 0707.Once your number is on this list it is illegal for companies to cold call and try to sell you something.If caught, firms face a fine of up to £500,000 by the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.However, signing up won\u0027t stop all nuisance calls. The rules don\u0027t apply to call centres based abroad, and typically don\u0027t deter fraudsters who are breaking the law anyway.Help!

Then, instead of your phone just ringing, you will be played their message so you can decide if you want to pick up.If you don\u0027t want to answer you can refuse the call and put the number on your block list. Friends and family can be added to a list of safe callers so they will get through every time.For the service to work, you must have a home phone which displays the numbers of callers on a screen.TalkTalk offers its customers a similar service called CallSafe.It has a national database of known unwanted callers that it blocks from getting through, and you can add further numbers to the list.It also offers a service that will reject calls from anyone who withholds their number.TalkTalk automatically creates a list of approved callers from your regularly dialled numbers so friends and family members can get straight through.You may want to invest in a standalone call-blocking gadget such as a trueCall device.This is a small plastic device that plugs in between your phone and the wall socket.It also intercepts calls to request that the caller states their name before being put through, and you can add numbers to a block or safe list.If the caller refuses to state their name, your phone won\u0027t even ring as they will be blocked automatically.Trading Standards has a small number of these gadgets to give away for free, so call your local council to see if you qualify.          Fight back: Many major telecoms companies now offer their own call blocking services. If you are with BT, you can sign up for BT Protect    Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027 free of charge.If you have an iPhone, hold your finger on the message until a menu pops up.Select \u0027more\u0027 and then look for the blue arrow in the bottom right hand side of your screen.Then enter the number 7726 and click send.You can also block the number so you do not receive any more messages.There\u0027s a blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 in it for information on the top right of the screen, within the nuisance message. Tap this, then the grey arrow in the top right — the list of options will include the choice to \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also report text messages online to the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office at ico.org.uk or by calling 0303 123 1113.The watchdog will ask you a series of questions such as what the text was about, whether you had a previous relationship with the firm that contacted you, and if the message worried you.You do not have to answer all the questions, but the more detail you can give the better.You can also report nuisance calls this way.However, scammers typically use multiple numbers so it\u0027s difficult to stop all spam texts from getting through.Many junk texts include an option to reply \u0027STOP\u0027 to prevent further messages. If you do so the company is legally required to stop sending marketing texts.But only do this if you are sure the message is from a legitimate company, such as your mobile provider or another firm you have dealt with in the past.If you are in any doubt, ignore it. Replying just confirms to the firm that your phone is active and they may hound you all the more or sell your number on to other crooks.Watch out for messages that appear to come from your bank or the taxman.Fraudsters are able to make it appear as though their text messages have been sent from a legitimate company.These spoof messages are often very convincing because they appear in the same thread as other genuine texts.To be safe, never click on any link or call a number given to you in an unexpected text message — even if it claims your account has been suspended or blocked.If you have any concerns call the phone number on the back of your bank card or statement.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs says it will never contact taxpayers about refunds or request personal details by text message.It advises people to forward any suspicious messages to 60599 (there may be a small charge if you do not have free text messages as part of your contract).                                                    If you think the call was from a fraudster, report it to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk, or by phoning 0300 123 2040. Blocking phone numbers on a smartphone is also easy. If you have an iPhone, for example, tap on the green square icon with a picture of a phone to pull up your recent calls list.There will be a little blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 for information next to the nuisance caller\u0027s number.Tap on this, scroll to the bottom of the list of options and select \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also download the free TPS Protect app which will help identify different types of nuisance calls.If a number is in the app\u0027s database because it\u0027s been reported by another user, a message will pop up telling you what type of company is calling.For example, it might say \u0027insurance\u0027 or \u0027PPI\u0027. It will also tell you if the number is a \u0027suspected scam\u0027. You can then reject the call and use your phone\u0027s settings to block it for ever.You can also report numbers by filling out a few details on the app, which will help other users. Details of reported calls will be passed on to the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.The app also gives telephone numbers a \u0027trust score\u0027 of between one and five, where one is likely to be a scam and five a company with a low number of complaints.But these are not always accurate so stay vigilant.For 99p a month you can add numbers to an automatic block list so that your phone doesn\u0027t ring when they call.But remember, you can already do this for free as we explain above. With the more advanced version of the app you can also choose only to accept calls above a certain trust score.The app can\u0027t identify calls that come from a withheld number.Instead, you may want to decline them so they are erted to your voicemail.moneymail@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/00/4D5EF25F00000578-0-image-a-7_1529452346812.jpg","title":"Culture Secretary declares schools ban mobile phones","story":"    Matt Hancock (pictured) said he admired head teachers who took a firm approach by banning mobile phonesMobile phones should be banned at the school gates, the Culture Secretary declared last night.Matt Hancock said he admired head teachers who took a firm approach by banning them.

The Trump spokeswoman would not say whether Nielsen was on the property specifically to talk about an executive order on family separation with President Trump. \u0027It\u0027s not like groundbreaking that a secretary that is part of the administration would be at the White House,\u0027 Sanders told reporters, noting that Nielsen is at the White House \u0027all the time.\u0027 News of an about-face came hours after the president publicly racheted his attacks on Democrats opposing his immigration agenda via Twitter. It also followed a press conference on Capitol Hill where  House Speaker Paul Ryan at which the GOP leader refused to entertain the prospect of a stand-alone bill to handle family separation.Ryan did not know about the executive order at the time, a person familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com, and was at the White House on Wednesday at the president\u0027s invitation to discuss immigration legislation he is about to bring up for a vote in the House.The GOP leader was at the White House with a group of roughly 25 lawmakers who DailyMail.com\u0027s source described as on the fence. Even with Trump\u0027s forthcoming executive order, Congress will still have to take the lead in making the policy shift permanent.\u0027It doesn\u0027t take away the fact that this needs to be changed into law at some point,\u0027 the person said. \u0027The courts could challenge what the president does in terms of executive action.\u0027 The president\u0027s U-turn came at an immediate cost to Members of Congress, who had been looking forward to a summer picnic at the White House on Thursday.President Trump said during his surprise media avail that he was cancelling the event.\u0027I do want to say that, because we\u0027re also busy....that we are going to cancel and postpone tomorrow\u0027s congressional picnic,\u0027 he stated.Trump met yesterday on Capitol Hill with GOP lawmakers to talk about a broad range of issues. He hosted two sets of legislators at the White House on Wednesday.Tomorrow\u0027s picnic would have offered him a chance to speak to the very same Democrats he\u0027s been clobbering for not supporting his immigration agenda. The president who is holding a political rally tonight in Minnesota said he did not think the optics of a festive picnic with legislators and their families would be appropriate. He insinuated that he did not want to reward the opposing party that he\u0027s repeatedly called obstructionist.\u0027I was just walking over to the Oval Office and I said, you know, it doesn\u0027t feel right to have a picnic for Congress when we\u0027re working on doing something very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027It didn\u0027t feel exactly right to me. We\u0027ll make it another time when things are going extremely well.\u0027   Trump indicated in his Cabinet Room remarks that the images of children at the border in cages and kennels had affected him outlook. \u0027Those images affect everybody,\u0027 he said of the photos that have been dominating the national news since Father\u0027s Day.The president told lawmakers, \u0027The dilemma is that if you\u0027re weak, if you\u0027re weak – which some people would like you to be – if you\u0027re really, really pathetically weak, the country\u0027s going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you\u0027re strong, then you don\u0027t have any heart. That\u0027s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I\u0027d rather be strong, but that\u0027s a tough dilemma.\u0027 Democrats have been pummeling the Trump administration as cruel and inhumane for splitting families up at the border in order to prosecute parents for unlawfully crossing the border.Trump said Wednesday that he wants \u0027security for our country, and we will have that.\u0027 \u0027At the same time we have compassion, we want to keep families together. It\u0027s very important,\u0027 he stated. \u0027I\u0027ll be signing something in a little while that\u0027s going to do that.\u0027He noted that Republicans are also working on legislation that meet the same end.\u0027But I\u0027ll be doing something that\u0027s somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by legislation I\u0027m sure.\u0027 How the president plans to get around a court settlement his administration has been holding up as the reason why it has to separate children from parents facing punished unless Congress acts was left unsaid.His exercise of executive power also flew in the face of Republican complaints about immigration directives put in place by the previous administration.Trump made reference to those today when he brought up Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, claiming that Obama acknowledged he shouldn\u0027t be signing the order and did anyway.The Republican president found himself in a similar bind this week as the opposing party stymied his immigration reform agenda.\u0027We\u0027re having a lot of problems with Democrats that don\u0027t want to vote for anything,\u0027 he said. \u0027They don\u0027t care about lack of security. They really would like to have open borders where anybody in the world can just flow in, including from the Middle East, from anybody anywhere they can just flow into our country. \u0027Tremendous problems with that, tremendous crime caused by that. We\u0027re just not going to do it.\u0027 Trump said in a tweet this morning that Democrats \u0027want open borders which means crime\u0027 as he saddled them with the burden of changing America\u0027s immigration laws, which he said are the \u0027weakest and worst anywhere in the world.\u0027He said in another vague message, whoever, that he is \u0027working on something\u0027 pertaining to immigration without saying what it is.The president seemed to signal this morning that whatever it was, lawmakers would still be in the hot seat to make changes to the legal system.            Immigration reform legislation was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, however, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the president. GOP leaders were looking at two pieces of legislation that would fund the president\u0027s border wall, one of which also takes steps to end family separation for Central American migrants.Conservative lawmakers were also crafting a \u0027back-up\u0027 bill that they hoped to sub in if the other two fail. Their bill sets aside most of Trump\u0027s other immigration priorities and deals solely with the detention of children coming across the border in family units.Trump said in a speech Tuesday that he supports a \u0027third option\u0027 and even claimed credit for it.Ryan said at a morning news conference that he was moving forward with the leadership-approved immigration reform bills that were scheduled for a vote tomorrow.Ryan refused to entertain questions about stand-alone bills that narrowly deal with the issue of young children being detained in cages and tents while their parents await prosecution for the crime of unlawfully entering the country.\u0027We\u0027re trying to pass this legislation right now. This is very good compromise legislation,\u0027 Ryan told reporters.It solves the border crisis, he claimed, and stabilizes the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, better known as DACA.\u0027And then when other situations arise, whatever the circumstances are, we\u0027ll cross this bridge when it comes to it,\u0027 he asserted.Ryan rejected Democrats\u0027 allegations that the GOP is using the immigrant children as bargaining chips to get more of the president\u0027s immigration priorities passed.\u0027That\u0027s a ridiculous assertion,\u0027 Ryan said as he stormed out, having already deemed it the last question.             Immigration reform legislation was no closer on Wednesday to gaining majority support in the House, however, even after a closed-door session between Republicans and the presidentIn morning tweets in which Trump insisted that Democrats are to blame for family separation because they will not bend to his will, he alluded to the measure again as he said he was \u0027working on something\u0027 that he suggested would change the conversation.\u0027It’s the Democrats fault, they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,\u0027 he said. \u0027They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!\u0027Coming out of the meeting with GOP lawmakers, the White House said that Trump was \u0027100 percent\u0027 behind the two bills House leadership plans to bring up for a vote.Trump reportedly did not talk to lawmakers at all about family separation. Democrats have pummeled the GOP for coupling family separation - a policy introduced in April by the Trump administration - with comprehensive immigration reform.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a Tuesday email to members, \u0027There is no universe in which forcibly separating now thousands of young children from their parents is acceptable. The practice is an abomination. It’s not part of any solution to fix our immigration system.\u0027Van Hollen said he spent his Father’s Day visiting immigrant detention centers on the border and \u0027there is no doubt that the Trump administration’s family separation policy is cruel and inhumane.\u0027\u0027In McAllen, Texas, I saw a facility people called “the dog kennel” which housed children separated from their mothers and fathers lumped into holding pens made of chain-link fence. It was a disturbing and shameful scene that should have no place in America,\u0027 the Maryland Democrat wrote.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi similarly wrote in an email on behalf of the lower chamber\u0027s campaign arm: \u0027I have never been more horrified by this President. His choice to separate immigrant children from their mothers at our border is heartless. It’s cruel. It’s immoral. And -- it’s all for political leverage.\u0027 House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican, admitted to Fox News on Tuesday after the meeting with the president that family separation was a policy of this president. \u0027The parents are now being prosecuted but we would like to see the family stay together and not separated,\u0027he said. \u0027But I think most importantly from my position as the chairman of homeland security is to have a border security bill passed.\u0027          Unless Congress acts, he said, smugglers and traffickers will continue to sell entry to the United States for for $6,000 a person.\u0027We will never stop this problem until we dry up the deterrent issue and the legal loopholes that existed currently,\u0027 he stated. Even some staunch allies of the president said they couldn\u0027t get behind him when it comes to the detention of families, though. His former lawyer on Wednesday quit the national party as deputy finance chair, citing the president\u0027s border policy and the special counsel investigation. \u0027As the son of a Polish holocaust survivor, the images and sounds of this family separation policy is heart wrenching,\u0027 Cohen said in a resignation letter according to ABC News. \u0027While I strongly support measures that will secure our porous borders, children should never be used as bargaining chips.\u0027First Lady Melania Trump was also said to be lobbying her husband to take action.She has pressed him privately, CNN reported, as well as publicly to address family separation.\u0027Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\u0027 her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said. \u0027She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.President Trump suggested Tuesday that he could cut down on unlawful migration by ending aid to the Central American countries that he claimed are \u0027sending\u0027migrants to the U.S. as part of his plot to secure the border.Trump said he\u0027d be asking for authorization to end assistance to the region that includes Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.\u0027We\u0027re not going to give any more aid to those countries,\u0027 he asserted during a Washington, D.C. speech to the National Federation of Independent Business. \u0027Why the hell should we?\u0027   The president told attendees of the conference, \u0027I don\u0027t want children taken away from parents. And when you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away.\u0027\u0027Now, we don\u0027t have to prosecute them. But then we\u0027re not prosecuting them for coming in illegally. That\u0027s not good,\u0027 he added.The president said then that he\u0027d be championing legislation to make sure that families that are flooding the border from Central America are not being separated as he lit into lawyers for migrants and judges he claimed are abusing the system.\u0027We want a great country. We want a country with heart,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027But when people come up, they have to know they\u0027re not going to get in. Otherwise it will never stop.\u0027 Vice President Mike Pence was coincidentally meeting at the White House on Wednesday afternoon with the Honduran president. A White House official suggested to DailyMail.com just before the meeting that Trump was just saber-rattling and had not actually requested that the aid be cut off.The official said, \u0027No decisions have been made on that at this time.\u0027 The president has repeatedly said that doesn\u0027t like that children are being separated from their legal guardians- even though it\u0027s a policy that was implemented by his administration.\u0027We can\u0027t let people pour in. They\u0027ve gotta go through the process,\u0027 he stated. \u0027And maybe it\u0027s politically correct or maybe it\u0027s not - we\u0027ve gotta stop separation of the families.\u0027Standing his ground, Trump said, \u0027But politically correct or not, we have to be a country that needs security, that needs safety, that has to be protected.\u0027 \u0027And remember, these countries that we give tremendous foreign aid to in many cases, they send these people up, and they\u0027re not sending their finest,\u0027 he claimed.  \u0027Does that sound familiar? Remember, I made that speech and I was badly criticized....Turned out I was 100 percent right. That\u0027s why I got elected.\u0027 Trump was referring to his 2015 announcement that he would be seeking the Oval Office. In the speech  he referred to illegal immigrants as rapists and criminals.Revisiting the charge on Tuesday, Trump said that many immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally will never appear at their court dates. \u0027If they\u0027re good, that\u0027s great. And if they\u0027re bad, you\u0027ll have killings, you\u0027ll have murders, you\u0027ll have this, you\u0027ll have that, you\u0027ll have crime.\u0027They\u0027re \u0027posing as families\u0027!

I don\u0027t want people coming in,\u0027 he asserted. Trump said the ease of entry has led to a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims. \u0027They game the system. They game it. It\u0027s so easy for them. They\u0027re smart. They didn\u0027t go to the Wharton School of Finance,\u0027 he said, name-checking his alma mater, \u0027but you know what. They\u0027re really smart.\u0027 Trump pounded Democrats for refusing to back his immigration agenda, which he said earlier in the day was allowing violent criminals \u0027to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13,\u0027 a violent illegal immigrant gang.   \u0027They don\u0027t want to give it, because Democrats love open borders. Let the whole world come in. Let the whole world. MS-13 gang members from all over the place, come on in -- we have open borders,\u0027 he said.\u0027And they view that possibly intelligently, except that it\u0027s destroying our country. They view that as potential voters. Someday they\u0027re going to vote for Democrats. Because they can\u0027t win on their policies, which are horrible. They found that out in the last presidential election.\u0027            Immigrant children are led by staff in single file between tents at a detention facility next to the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas          A view from Mexico of the US Customs and Boarder Protection is housing underage people caught illegally entering the United States at the Tornillo Port of Entry in Guadalupe Bravos          US Border Patrol agents patrol the bed of the Rio Grand in front of where the US Customs and Boarder Protection is housing underage people          Locals walk along the Mexico side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Tijuana          A remark on Tuesday about crime-committing illegals that \u0027infest\u0027 the U.S. immediately stoked controversy, with the president\u0027s detractors saying the blanket description was not only wrong but inhumane. Another incident earlier this year caused outrage when the president called gangster immigrants \u0027animals\u0027 in another statement his critics cast as incendiary. Monday in unscripted remarks Trump said that he\u0027s implementing strict immigration policies because he doesn\u0027t want the United States to end up like Europe.\u0027The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. Won\u0027t be,\u0027 he charged in fiery remarks at a White House event.\u0027You look at what\u0027s happening in Europe. You look at what\u0027s happening in other places. We can\u0027t allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch.\u0027  The White House has spent the past week fighting with Democrats accusing theTrump administration of exploiting migrant families instead of taking an expected post-Singapore Kim summit victory lap.Each side has condemned the other for using children as \u0027pawns\u0027 in a raging illegal immigration debate.     Trump suggested the United States\u0027 could bolster its credentials as leader of the free world by passing merit-based immigration laws that put a premium on high-skilled workers and lock down America\u0027s porous borders          \u0027The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility. Won\u0027t be,\u0027 he charged  later in fiery remarks at a White House event.A rotating cast of Trump administration officials appeared on national news networks to buttress the president\u0027s arguments and assail Democrats using family separation as a cudgel against the Republicans\u0027 in their war over illegal immigration.Hogan Gidley, a deputy spokesman for the president, appeared on Fox News and asserted that Democrats are \u0027playing politics with people\u0027s lives. They\u0027re doing it on the backs of children. It\u0027s absolutely grotesque.\u0027 \u0027All they want to do is go down and grandstand and try to use this to political gain to try and get reelected in a few years, and it\u0027s grotesque,\u0027 he told reporters as he walked back inside the White House to his office. \u0027We can fix it right now, we can protect our citizens, but more important protect all the children around the world who are trying to come here.\u0027 The Trump spokesman claimed that migrant families \u0027separate themselves a lot of times,\u0027 sending their children with coyotes promising to bring them across the border for a hefty price.\u0027It\u0027s a deplorable situation, we\u0027ve gotta fix it. And Congress could do it tomorrow, if you close the loopholes, the situation\u0027s solved,\u0027 Gidley stated.     The president\u0027s pitch: \u0027\u0027This could really be something very special. It could be something. Maybe even for the world to watch.

Catch and release is a protocol under which people detained by US authorities as unlawful immigrants can be released while they wait for a hearingWhite House Director of Strategic of Communications Mercede Schlapp said on Fox that Democrats are \u0027using children as political pawns\u0027 and are essentially \u0027advocating for the smugglers who are bringing these children over\u0027 the border.\u0027We have our hands tied and the smugglers have the advantage,\u0027 she said, insisting that MS-13 gang members are bringing over small children as leverage.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen says Democrats bludgeoning the administration for its \u0027zero tolerance\u0027 policy at the border are acting \u0027cowardly\u0027 and could change federal immigration law if they wanted to.Nielsen stood at the White House podium on Monday and argued that DHS was just doing its job in enforcing a Trump administration policy that has led more than 2,000 children to be separated from their parents or guardians in the last six weeks.\u0027If an American were to commit a crime anywhere in the United States,\u0027 she told a room full of reporters, \u0027they would go to jail and they would be separated from their family.\u0027Nielsen said, \u0027This is not a controversial idea.\u0027When asked by reporters if the policy amounts to \u0027child abuse\u0027, Nielsen denied the accusation.\u0027We have high standards.

Muranaga, whose family was interned at Granada Relocation Center in Colorado, joined the U.S. Army but was killed in Italy. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton.   Slavery Before abolition, children of black slaves were born into slavery and could be sold by owners at will. Black women could do little to stop the sale of children and often never saw them again after they were sent away.  Visitors file past the sculpture of a slave girl, one out of 40 statues spread about the grounds, titled, \u0027Children of Whitney,\u0027 by Woodrow Nash, inside the Antioch Baptist Church, at the Whitney Plantation in Edgard, LA          Black women could do little to stop the sale of children and often never saw them again after they were sent away. Pictured: Slaves on a plantation on Edisto Island in South Carolina, 1862Owners also split apart parents who had no legal rights to prevent their sale. To resist, slave families regularly ran away together but faced harsh physical punishment, even death, if caught by slave hunters.Last week, both White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Attorney Jeff Sessions cited the Bible in defending the policy of forced separation of Latino migrant children. Sessions referenced Romans 13, which urges readers \u0027to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order.\u0027 The same passage was cited before the Civil War to justify slavery, to allow slave hunters to return runaway slaves to their owners and to pull slave children away from mothers.Native American boarding schoolsAfter the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, when the Army slaughtered 150 Lakota men, women and children in the last chapter of America\u0027s long Indian wars, authorities forced Native American families to send their children to government- or church-run boarding schools. The objective, as Carlisle Indian Industrial School founder Capt. Richard H. Pratt put it, was to \u0027kill the Indian in him and save the man.\u0027  Millie Friday, a descendent of Little Plume, a Native American student who was taken from his family and forced to go to boarding school, is comforted by Barbara Andrews-Christy of Circle Legacy Center, as Aílice Hall looks during a gathering on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, in Carlisle, PA  A gravesite of Herbert Littlehawk at the cemetery at the Carlisle Indian School in Carlisle, PA. Littlehawk, an American Indian student who was taken from his family, is buried at the siteAt 150 or so Indian schools around the country, officials made Native American children cut their hair and outlawed all Native American languages. They forced children to adopt Christianity and attempted to \u0027Americanize\u0027 children by introducing them to white customs and white history.Native American children returned home almost unrecognizable to their parents.Still, some children resisted the boarding school experience by setting fires to buildings, running away or taking their own lives. Others continued to speak their native language in secret.Some Navajo \u0027code talkers,\u0027 who used a code based on their native language to transmit messages in World War II, were products of military-style boarding schools as children.Poverty During the early 1900s, states sometimes pulled children from poor families and placed them in orphanages.           Malcolm X in his autobiography recalled welfare workers coming to take him and his siblings away as children from his struggling single motherBut reformers in the 1920s and 1930s began promoting the idea that children should not be separated from their families, according to \u0027In the Shadow Of the Poorhouse: A Social History Of Welfare In America\u0027 by Michael B. Katz.However, local and state authorities still used poverty as a reason to take children away from Native American and black families, National Association of Social Workers CEO Angelo McClain said. Sometimes the ordered separation came over concerns about a parent\u0027s mental health.Malcolm X in his autobiography recalled welfare workers coming to take him and his siblings away as children from his struggling single mother after their father, an outspoken black preacher, was mysteriously murdered. The future civil rights leader lived in various foster homes and boarding houses. His mother, without her children, had a breakdown and was sent to a mental institution.Immigration During the Great Depression, local authorities in California and Texas participated in a mass deportation of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans whom they blamed for the economic downturn. Between 500,000 and 1 million Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans were pushed out of the country during the 1930s repatriation, as the removal is sometimes called.          During the Great Depression (pictured are men outside the New York Stock Exchange in 1929 after the market crash), local authorities in California and Texas participated in a mass deportation of Mexican immigrants and Mexican Americans whom they blamed for the economic downturnSome families hid children away from relatives in the U.S. to prevent them from being sent to a foreign country they had never visited, according to Francisco Balderrama, a Chicano studies professor at California State University-Los Angeles and co-author of \u0027Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s.\u0027Many families felt they were being forced to separate from their children, who were U.S. citizens.\u0027And many children,\u0027 Balderrama said, \u0027never saw their parents again.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f1ca86e989a4fce1cc9d36ce7420622f4bd2a3/0_904_3233_1940/master/3233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=274120558f0c4e8c0ebbebcefb72a636","title":"preti tanejas awe inspiring reimagining of king lear wins desmond elliott prize","story":"Debut novel We That Are Young takes £10,000 award after early struggles to find a publisherPreti Taneja’s debut novel We That Are Young, a reimagining of King Lear set in contemporary India that was rejected by multiple major publishers as commercially unviable, has won the £10,000 Desmond Elliott prize.Judges for the award, which is named after the late literary agent and publisher and is intended to reward a first novel that is “both vividly written and confidently realised”, described We That Are Young as “awe-inspiring” in its “scope, ambition, skill and wisdom”. Chair and author Sarah Perry said that after reading it, she and her fellow judges “sat together shaking our heads, saying, ‘If this is her first novel, what extraordinary work will come next?’”Taneja sets her version of Shakespeare’s play in Delhi, where Devraj, the founder of a vast Indian corporation, has resigned. His older daughters Radha and Gargi are handed the company, while his youngest has run away to avoid marriage. It is a “commemorative portrait of a destroyed dynasty, a triptych dedicated to three departed sisters”, according to the judges, containing “prose as sensual, perfumed and parti-coloured as a wedding basket of ladoo, inset with gems of pure poetry”.Taneja, who has worked as a human rights reporter and now teaches writing in prisons, told the  books podcast earlier this week that when her debut was first submitted to publishers in 2013, there was “absolute deafening silence”. We That Are Young was eventually acquired in 2016 by the small independent publisher Galley Beggar Press, which also discovered Eimear McBride’s multiple award-winning debut A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing. At the time, director Eloise Millar told the Bookseller: “When Preti’s novel was first submitted to us, it came with a history of ecstatic rejections from editors, who almost universally felt that her writing was extraordinary but too ‘tricksy’ to be a commercial success.”We That Are Young beat Gail Honeyman’s bestseller, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, and  journalist Paula Cocozza’s How to Be Human. Chair of the prize’s trustees Dallas Manderson said Taneja’s book was “exactly the kind of novel that the prize exists to discover and promote this extraordinarily accomplished debut has flown somewhat under the radar thus far, not having received the attention and widespread acclaim that it so rightly deserves”.“Our hope is that winning the prize will help guarantee Preti’s long-term future as an author, as we’re sure it will be bright,” said Manderson. “It is particularly gratifying, too, to witness the ongoing success of Galley Beggar Press. I know Desmond, who launched his own independent publishing house, Arlington Books, and dedicated his career to promoting new writers, would be delighted to see that a prize in his name is championing similarly small-but-mighty institutions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35eebc5131a216147cc2fe296d1e332e185bfa43/201_934_2367_1420/master/2367.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fcf0ef5fe80a4822e5757a1d068820f","title":"the futures female 2000ads all women special","story":"A new sci-fi edition has been written and drawn entirely by women, which the comic hopes will put an end to its boy’s club reputationIt’s one of the UK’s most venerable comic weeklies, but is 2000AD, home of Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog and Robo-Hunter, still seen as a bit of a boy’s thing? More than 40 years after it first hit the newsstands, that image might be set to change, with a new issue created entirely by female writers, artists, colourists and letterers.The 2000AD sci-fi special includes Batgirl artist Babs Tarr illustrating a Judge Dredd story, graphic novelist Tillie Walden writing and drawing one of the comic’s famous Future Shock shorts, and Irish novelist and playwright Maura McHugh penning a story about Judge Anderson, Dredd’s telepath colleague.2000AD editor Matt Smith hopes the special will encourage more women to contribute to the weekly comic. “With an increasing number of female writers and artists finding work in 2000AD, I felt it was time to showcase women creators,” he said. “2000AD has a bit of a reputation as a boys’ club, but the truth is that I welcome pitches from everyone.”Although 2000AD has history employing women – notably Annie Parkhouse and Ellie de Ville, whose lettering has appeared in every issue over the last quarter of a century – they have not been at the forefront of its creative teams. Earlier this year, artist Emily Zeinner became the first woman to illustrate the cover since 1983, while 2000AD’s annual competition to find new writing talent was won last year by Laura Bailey – the first ever female winner.“If you open an issue and all you see are male names in the credit box, it might discourage some from approaching it. So I wanted to address that,” says Smith.2000AD’s flagship character is Judge Dredd, and in 2013 Emma Beeby became the first woman to write the future lawman patrolling the vast MegaCity One. “Judge Dredd is really fun to write,” she says. “He walks the line between hero and villain, comedy and horror. There’s something both disturbing and reassuring about getting into his head. I felt quite intimidated, being a woman writing such a legendary and masculine character, among all these male creators, but I was made welcome. It’s a great community of creators and fans and it feels like home to me now.”Tarr says it was “completely appropriate” for a comic with 2000AD’s longevity to focus an issue on women creators. “I think it’s a great move that says, ‘All are welcome.’ If it helps shine light on new and existing female creators then I’m happy to be a part of it!” she says.However, she hopes that the comics industry won’t “need niche things like ‘all-female’ specials to give girls jobs in comics” in the future – a sentiment echoed by artist Emma Vieceli, who worked on a Judge Anderson story for the special.“We nearly all strive toward a day when a publisher can do what 2000AD have boldly done here without the main push of the promotion being a discussion about the fact that it’s an all-female issue,” she says. “I can’t remember many comic books being promoted as ‘all-male’, after all, despite many being exactly that. Why would we care? Why do we care if it’s all-female? It really shouldn’t be seen as such an oddity.“One day, an issue like this will come along and the contributors will only be asked about their stories and process and not their gender.”• 2000AD sci-fi special is released in the UK on 20 June, with a July release in the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bcc63e472163996d07f3c598fbcc13ada28ad55/432_707_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559bf9824c866245f42d617a623861d4","title":"burger king world cup pregnant offer apology russian","story":"Burger King’s Russian ision has apologized for a social media campaign offering free burgers for life to women who get pregnant by football starsBurger King has apologized for a poor-taste ad campaign posted on its official Russian social media account.On Tuesday the burger chain announced a promotion on VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, offering women 3 million Russian roubles ($47,000) and a lifetime supply of Whoppers if they get impregnated by football players competing in the World Cup. Shortly after announcing the campaign they pulled it due to backlash. Burger King posted a statement on VK apologizing and said it had removed all materials related to the promotion. However, evidence of the stunt lives on in screenshots. Burger King’s Russia ision has a history of horrific publicity-baiting stunts. Last year it made fun of a teenage rape victim in an online marketing campaign. The fast-food company used the likeness of Diana Shurygina, who was raped when she was 16 at a house party, as part of a buy one get one free burger offer. And it’s not just Russia Burger King has a global track record of misogynistic marketing. In Singapore the company advertised a seven-inch burger with overtly sexual imagery and a tagline saying “It’ll blow your mind away.” The model featured in the 2009 advertising campaign later came forward to say she had no idea her image was going to be used in that way.

But my grandfather was a communist, which had all kinds of ramifications. Big stuff like, I don’t know, living in a caravan once and receiving the side-eye while out and about. I never had this first-hand I only met him once in adulthood, shortly before he died, when I was 17 and he poured me a gin and tonic with so much gin in there wasn’t any room for tonic. “You’ll have to drink some first and then I’ll give you some tonic,” he said, all tetchy, like I was a spoilt young person who wanted their pudding before they’d finished their main course.At some point I formed the view, almost certainly because my dad said it, that he was the leader of the Communist party of Great Britain, and that persisted until I went to university and met a smartarse who said that over the time period in question – the 20s and 30s – it was a closed organisation of revolutionary cells, and all the leaders ended up in prison. A couple of years later, Google was invented, and this same smartarse said he found it unlikely that my grandfather was in the party at all, unless he worked in heavy engineering, textiles or mining. I took this information back to my father and said, “This didn’t happen, did it?” And he said, “What on earth can you mean?” And I said, “I mean, is this like the time you told the insurance man you’d been burgled when really your stereo was on top of your wardrobe covered in a blanket?” And he said, “Not the Communist party, you nitwit! The Young Communist League.”Fast-forwarding 20 years, my father is dead, and I wouldn’t be without his mysterious untruths for the world, especially the time he stole some sausages from my mother’s freezer and nobody could work out why, until after sustained interrogation it turned out that he had also stolen a bottle of wine and wanted to keep it cool on his journey home.Unrelatedly, I was researching Margaret McKay, the Labour MP for Clapham 1964-70, for a compendium of every female MP ever, celebrating 100 years since women’s suffrage. Aged 20, she’d bunked off her weaver’s job, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Russian revolution from the balcony at the world’s finest ballet, met Lenin’s widow, stayed in her first hotel, and for why? Because she was a member of the Young Communist League. Presumably they had a flat structure because they were communists, but also a very strict unspoken hierarchy because they were Communists, so just from the cargo lists of their boat to Russia in 1927, she was in the top 10.Anyway, I can now report with complete certainty that my grandfather was not the leader, and with relative certainty that nor was he a member. Thinking maybe the dates were off, I checked the 30s, when he was also not a member, and didn’t bother with the 40s, as by that time he would no longer have been young. I checked whether there was a children’s ision – maybe he was leader of the Communist Cubs League? – and there was not.Myth-making is universal: your grandad wasn’t in the war, yours was not that shoulder you can see in a picture of the Beatles, and oi, over there, yours didn’t have an allotment. If, in some peculiar fetish of middle age, I want the Communist party in my family tree, I’ll have to join it myself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d47f99a0fad5a8ab4e66fb7437298f8210bdaf7e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0623a5994ad998858b40d8e80ae96f9a","title":"20000 losses and late night casino binges the student gambling epidemic","story":"Three former addicts tell their stories of gambling at university – and explain what can be done to prevent more young people falling into the trapThe cocktail of new-found freedom at university, easy availability of borrowed money and the ever-present opportunity to gamble has driven some students to academic failure, bankruptcy and mental health problems.Gambling is a growing issue for students at British universities. The Gambling Commission estimated that more than 100,000 students are in debt due to their habit, with one in four of those indebted beyond £10,000.Stopping gambling is more difficult than it might seem. Online bookmakers have plied ex-gamblers with targeted ads attempting to lure them back, while thousands of people who self-excluded have still been able to access their accounts. Meanwhile, there is precious little support for this type of problem on university campuses, beyond traditional counselling. The issue was highlighted by the NUS last month when it partnered with Gamban, an app which blocks gambling sites. Here, three ex-students describe how they became addicted to gambling at university and what can be done to prevent more young people falling into the trap.I would lose my student loan almost as soon as I received it. Hours of free time during the day at university did not suit me well. Every man and his dog in my year gambled it was so widespread that among a group of friends you may be the odd one out if you haven’t had a flutter on a game you were watching. Soon, that bet on the football becomes an expensive, drunken night at the casino that you regret the next day. Then you’re always trying to make your losses back.The late night rollercoasters of online gambling and casino trips took their toll and led to me not attending classes at university at all. You get depressed and it’s all downhill from there. Losing the money I relied on to live made university seem pointless and it altered my mindset to such an extent that I didn’t care about my education anymore. They were dark days and it still runs deep.I ended up dropping out of university and working full-time to pay back thousands of pounds of debt. A large student debt was bad enough, but when that is coupled with payday loans, credit card and overdraft debt with a much closer deadline it really doesn’t put you in very good stead for normal life.Gambling addiction can be hidden and lied away. I compulsively lied to family and friends to borrow money. I think universities should offer Gamblers Anonymous meetings. I was unable to get to a GA until after I dropped out, which delayed my recovery.I self-excluded from websites throughout uni, which did stop me gambling with that specific company – but there is always another bookie lurking around the corner. I also self-excluded from a casino but soon after, due to regulatory changes, you didn’t have to give a name so there was never a doubt that I would be able to enter.I gambled as a form of escapism. I was incredibly bored and, on a deeper level, I wanted to distract myself from being emotionally honest because I wasn’t at all happy at university.Universities need to be much more proactive in preventing addiction taking root. They need to raise gambling to the same level of conversation as that which already exists for drugs and alcohol on campus.The poker society I was part of was offered £100,000 in bonuses from gambling sites in exchange for sponsorship. Yet there were no guidelines from the university or union with how to deal with these approaches – they are designed to get people addicted, not to help a fledgling poker society pay for blazers. I ended up losing more than £20,000.Gambling is a distraction from everyday life. It’s like being in another universe. Theoretically, you are able to control events at a poker table, where you’re able to make controlled decisions – such as wagering a certain bet, at a certain time, in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. That’s a relieving feeling in the modern world.As a problem gambler you don’t set out to lose money, what you’re doing is spending an amount you’re comfortable wagering, and if you lose that, for some people it ends there. It’s when £20 – which could be considered light entertainment – becomes £100, or £1,000 and soon you’re playing catch up to make back your losses. That’s why the bookies offer you a free £10 here, a free £20 there, because they know it gets people hooked.Gambling addicts need the ups and downs of it, the ecstasy and excitement of winning and the crippling agony of losing. Flirting with the two is the thing that makes gamblers tick. The activity is one thing but it’s what it’s doing with your brain that’s the main thing. For me, I would rather have been losing and playing than not playing at all because if you’re trying to escape from your own mood, you would take the low – over the absence of a low. Left untreated, addicts seek a higher thrill – by betting more money – to get that euphoric, dopamine-driven high again.I remember one day I played for 14 hours straight. There’s always a game of poker going on online and if you’re really into poker, why wouldn’t you play? I now have a piece of gambling exclusion software on my computer which helps me fight the urge to play.When you don’t have much money, it sometimes seems that you don’t have much to lose. Most gambling today is intertwined with compulsive smartphone usage as most betting is now done at the touch of a button. This is partly why it is a growing problem.I played online poker over a long period. But because my losses were broken up by big wins, it took longer to see my behaviour as problematic and that it massively impacted all areas of my life. I had developed a serious gambling problem while I was at university. For me, becoming addicted was an incremental process. I started playing for pennies and at the end I was losing £1,500 in a single hand.It’s an addiction that doesn’t at first have any visible effects and can be hidden by people who want to keep their gambling secret. Therefore, universities need to offer support in the same way they do in other areas because there is currently little to no support for this type of addiction.Gambling at university was a burden that I, and many others, could easily hide. I certainly didn’t contact my university about my problem so more education on the addiction and visibility would help.I attempted to self-exclude many times but often relapsed. The self-exclusions can be undermined by making new accounts, but this could easily be solved if every site required a picture of a passport and there was a central database of excluders.It was only when I had a total block put on my devices, with the password held by my mother, that I was able to get over my gambling addiction. Eventually, I only avoided bankruptcy when my parents bailed me out of several thousand pounds of payday loan debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b973c9b26afc40a7bbaa8c4d4112809a9ddb54ee/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb82ae158b23a8d586ec1ca5406de9ac","title":"barnacled angels the whales of stellwagen bank a photo essay","story":"Off the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayOff the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayAt the tip of Cape Cod, a sandy spit reaches out into the Atlantic, like an arm, towards a vast underwater plateau where humpbacks gather each summer to feed. This is the US marine sanctuary of Stellwagen Bank, where for the past three weeks I’ve been a guest on the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch boats, working out of Provincetown. I’ve been coming here for 18 years it’s where I learned about whales. I’m inordinately fond of these animals and like me, they come back here too. Every spring, the whales return from their mating grounds in the Caribbean where they’ve spent the winter, fasting: those clear blue waters hold no sustenance for a whale. The grey-green seas of the Cape are filled with food: the cycle of upwelling nutrition feeds phytoplankton, that feed zooplankton, that feed the sand-eels, that feed the whales. They’re unconcerned by the clouds of gulls that follow them, in the same cycle, after the same food – even stealing fish out of the whales’ mouths. Like other rorqual whales, humpbacks’ throats expand in rubbery pleats reaching down to their navels. Opening their mouths wide, they strain their food using the strips of baleen – made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails – that hang from their upper jaws. Humpbacks co-operate in one of the most spectacular sights in the natural world. Blowing precisely calibrated streams of bubbles from their mouths, they swim round in circles, creating curtains of air around their prey. Then they rise, open-mouthed like giant crows. As they do so, they seem to alter the shape of the water itself. This whale is thwacking its tail up and down in behaviour known as lob-tailing. But only the humpbacks of Stellwagen Bank use another technique, ‘kick-feeding’, to stun their prey. It’s learned, local culture.This may be the most closely studied population of great whales in the world. The Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies (PCCS) was founded in 1976 to observe and document these animals. At that time, whaling was still widely practised. A veteran captain of the Dolphin Fleet told me that back in the 1960s, one Provincetown diner used to serve humpback steaks. With the advent of the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch, founded in 1975 by the Avellar family (Portuguese in descent, like many of the fishing community in Provincetown), commerce was allied with science. With naturalists on the boats, PCCS was able to gather an immense database, sustained by tourist dollars. The result is a catalogue of 2,000 inidual whales. One of the first to be named, Salt, has had 14 calves, and is now a great-grandmother.  Humpbacks have unique black and white patterns on the underside of their flukes, enabling the identification of inidual animals. Each receives non-gender-specific names not because Provincetown is a gender-fluid town – which it certainly is – but because it is difficult to sex a whale.This whale is an exception. She’s displaying her genital mound, which is usually impossible to see.Some whales are truly striking. This speckled female has been called Ventisca –Spanish for “snowstorm”. She’s one of the first whales I ever saw, back in 2000. She’s a popular performer, partial to rolling on her back. Humpbacks show no fear of the whalewatch boats. These whales may also be among the most habituated to humans. Sometimes on the boat we joke that we’re providing a ‘human watch’ for whales. As to what they really make of us, we may never know. Dennis Minsky, veteran naturalist on the Dolphin Fleet, has a wild theory. “Every day I announce a whale’s name over the tannoy system,” he says. “If my dog Dory recognises her name, what’s to say these whales don’t?” This whale rose perpendicularly through the water to peer at us. It’s called “spy-hopping” to me it looks like curiosity. Fascinated by whale-human culture, Minksy has compiled a “whalewatch glossary” of terms used by the captains. A breaching whale is a “Hail Mary”. Irritating leisure craft are generically “plastic”. It’s a sort of update on Moby-Dick. With more swear words.Fin whales – the next biggest animals on Earth after blue whales – also scythe through these waters. Vast and enigmatic, nicknamed the greyhounds of the sea, they can reach 24 knots, as fast as our boat. They have uniquely asymmetrical markings – pale on one side of their bodies, dark on the other. They use the white side to scare fish with a sudden flash – then gulp down their prey. A pair of lunge-feeding fin whales once lurched so close to our prow that our captain, Todd Motta, shouted, “Whoa!”, But far from colliding with us, they seemed to be using our boat as a fish-stop. On calm days, this ocean becomes hypnotic. Below its silvery surface - which Herman Melville called “the ocean’s skin” - white-sided dolphin surfed into view, leaping and foraging around the whales. They’re beautifully marked, with grey and mustard stripes that seem to streamline their bodies. One came close to the boat, visible through that watery skin like a super-realist art work by Gerhard Richter.  Of all great whales, humpbacks are most prone to breaching. No one knows why. Are they trying to dislodge troublesome parasites or communicating with other whales? Anyone who sees a 15-metre whale launch itself out of the ocean is sure of one thing: it looks like fun. Melville observed of the humpback: “He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.” As this calf leapt, it looked close to landing on a dolphin. Hanging there in the air, a humpback demonstrates its kinship with us. No whale so well deserves its binomial: Megaptera novaeangliae – “big-winged New Englander”, a barnacled angel.• With grateful thanks to the Dolphin Fleet, its crew and its naturalists.Philip Hoare’s RisingTideFallingStar (4th Estate) is published this month in paperback.

Here’s what the current row tells us about clothes, power and shameWhat can I wear to prevent anyone taking a photo of my crotch at a festival?Mary, by emailA vagina. As most of us now know, the practice of “upskirting” – taking a photo of a woman’s crotch without her consent – has now become so widespread that one young woman, Gina Martin, felt compelled to launch a bill to make it illegal after some troglodyte upskirted her in Hyde Park. But, as most of us also now know, a Tory MP, one Sir Christopher Chope, blocked this bill’s progress – not, he has been crossly saying ever since, because he is such a fan of seeing random strangers’ crotches. No, he is just upset about the legislation process, you see. And truly, who could doubt the strong good morals of Sir Christopher Crotch? OK, so he voted against same-sex marriage and against the equal pay bill, he referred to parliamentary staff as “servants” and, just to add the toxic cherry on top, charged £881 to his parliamentary expenses for repairing his sofa. And yes, on the same day he blocked the upskirting bill, he also blocked a bill to protect police dogs and horses. But this is all because he is such a morally upstanding kinda guy.And speaking of upstanding, let’s talk upskirting. It says a lot about how little people care about female consent that they haven’t been angrier about this before now, because it is not like upskirting has been a secret – upskirt shots of celebrities have been in the tabloids for decades. In fact, most of us have borne witness to the most notorious upskirt shot of all time, when Paul Verhoeven tricked Sharon Stone into taking off her underwear for the shooting of one infamous scene. Verhoeven promised Stone that nothing would be visible, only for Stone to realise too late that Verhoeven had not just upskirted her, but was putting the results in every multiplex around the world.Maybe people told themselves that upskirting happens because women – those silly women! – insist on wearing skirts so short it turns the world into their gynaecologist, to quote the eternally quotable Patsy from Ab Fab. Those poor photographers – those women will not stop shoving their gussets in their lenses.A lawyer, Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman, brought the noble Freeman name into disrepute last weekend when he tweeted: “While this is totally unacceptable conduct, if women assumed some responsibility for their attire, they would not be in jeopardy.” This point was so absurd even Freeman’s daughter, Sophie,  replied to her father to tell him that this was “one of the top 3 stupidest comments you’ve ever made.” Nick then replied, wrongly: “it’s most stupid, not stupidest”. And that, Nick, goes into your top four.Last month, I saw some paparazzi using selfie sticks to take upskirt shots of young women leaving a movie premiere, and some of those women were wearing dresses so long the photographer had to wiggle his selfie stick under their hems, which were literally dragging on the ground.So shall we get something straight? Upskirting – like all forms of sexual assault, which is what upskirting is – has nothing to do with a woman’s hemline, but everything to do with that woman possessing genitals. And that’s because sexual assaults have nothing to do with sex. There is nothing sexy about a blurry camera phone shot of an oblivious stranger’s vagina, unless you find humiliation sexy. This is about young women being shamed for going out and having fun, and men wanting to tell them they have power over them. It’s telling that the kind of men who victim-shame are the kind who patronise their own daughters.A couple of years ago, there was some talk about whether it’s possible to tell a funny rape joke. To date, only Wanda Sykes has managed it, with her riff about how vaginas should be detachable so women could go out at night and not risk rape. Now we know another factor in favour of the detachable vagina, which is that women can go to Hyde Park and not have a stranger’s phone camera act like a speculum on her anatomy. So until the upskirt bill passes, I urge Sir Christopher to investigate detachable vaginas. We could even refer to them as our “chope” in his honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/229d028297a02653787fe81228b06af0d16ca8dd/70_215_5617_3370/master/5617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e216b11f0bbbb875055b4e0b234966da","title":"disney raises offer for 21st century fox to 713bn and outflanks comcast","story":"A 5050 mix of cash and shares is bid to beat rival to bulk of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empireDisney has boosted its offer for 21st Century Fox to more than $71bn in a bid to knock rival Comcast out of the battle to buy the bulk of Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment empire.Disney has upped its offer to $71.3bn (£54bn) – from $52.4bn – trumping Comcast’s $65bn all-cash hostile offer tabled last week.Fox, which backed Disney’s original bid, said that in light of the new offer Comcast’s bid cannot be considered to result in a better deal for shareholders.“We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at 21st Century Fox and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry,” Murdoch, the executive chairman of Fox, said. “We remain convinced that the combination of Fox’s iconic assets, brands and franchises with Disney’s will create one of the greatest, most innovative companies in the world.”“The acquisition of 21st Century Fox will bring significant financial value to the shareholders of both companies and after six months of integration planning we’re even more enthusiastic and confident in the strategic fit of the assets and the talent at Fox,” Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, said. Comcast, the US cable operator and media group, is not expected to go away, however. It has also lodged a separate £22bn bid to buy all of Sky, and under chief executive Brian Roberts it is expected to respond with an improved offer as a bidding war hots up over the summer. Fox said the company directors remain open to “evaluating a competing proposal”.Christopher Hohn, the activist investor behind hedge fund TCI, last month wrote a letter to the Fox board pointing out that Murdoch has a potential conflict of interest as capital gains tax issues could lead him to preferring a lower priced stock offer from Disney over the cash deal from Comcast.Disney has sought to address that issue, sweetening its offer while giving Fox shareholders the choice between taking cash or stock.However, if Murdoch wants to raise his bid for Skyin order to compete with Comcast, he must get the green light for an increased bid from Disney.On a call with analysts on Wednesday, Disney’s Iger refused to say where he stands on the progress of Fox’s bid for Sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/887ee48f7f289d38eb277f941420e052fb5ea7f2/91_67_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8de52302272b7e30c0e0e47fcad5830c","title":"england world cup 2018 gareth southgate shoulder","story":"Gareth Southgate has become the first major casualty of England’s World Cup campaign after dislocating his right shoulder while running near the team’s base on the Gulf of Finland.The national manager suffered the injury while jogging in the beach resort of Repino on Wednesday, a scheduled day off for his squad which most had used to visit family and friends in St Petersburg. Southgate was treated in a nearby hospital, with the assistance of the England team doctor Rob Chakraverty, and has admitted he will have to temper any goal fist-pumping celebrations over the remainder of the tournament.“I might not be celebrating any goals as athletically in future,” he said. “The doc has made it clear that punching the air is not an option. We have got such a great support team and they were there very quickly. They were supposed to be relaxing because we let the players have a bit of time off and I am causing them work. We are lucky we have a top-class medical team around us, so it was fine. I had brilliant help from them, and I am just sorry that I managed to ruin their day off.”Southgate, his right arm in a sling, was back at the team’s training base in Repino on Wednesday evening in time to hold a scheduled meeting with his squad, looking ahead to Sunday’s second Group G fixture against Panama, before dinner.“It is better this is me than one of the players,” he added. “They were a bit surprised in the team meeting and were asking: ‘What have you been doing?’ As always, they were probably quite amused. It is good that we have had a quiet day today so I had prepared the meeting before and we are on to preparations for Panama. I am just a bit gutted because I was on for my record 10k time.”The manager joins Dele Alli in the treatment room - Marcus Rashford has now recovered from a knock to his knee suffered back at St George’s Park prior to departure - with the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder having suffered a minor thigh strain during Monday’s opening victory over Tunisia.That injury is not serious and, while Alli may miss a few days training and is likely to be rested in Nizhny Novgorod on Sunday, he should be back in contention for the game against Belgium. Southgate, on the other hand, may have to be more restrained for the remainder of England’s participation in the tournament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bca10dd7003ee09c8173a81712babf123917cd2/2804_372_2667_1600/master/2667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d299a0b0742a2fbe10ab7d9ea9046ba0","title":"france olivier giroud peru world cup","story":"Considering how many of the World Cup aristocracy did not manage to win their opening games in Russia, the France camp have raised a collective eyebrow about the negativity that swirled around the three points they collected against Australia.Questions came thick, fast and critical. Why couldn’t they create more chances? Are the tactics flawed? Should the front three be abandoned? What about Paul Pogba? (There is always something about Paul Pogba.) Raphaël Varane took a moment when he was up in front of the media at France’s base camp in Istra, near Moscow, to ask something of the inquisitors. “If you could be a bit more positive, that would be cool,” he said.The thing is, being more positive is exactly what the public crave from France. For a country with ambitions to fare well in this World Cup, to try to go further than the quarter-final exit in Brazil four years ago, the pattern of the opening game was a worry. The team did not function smoothly. The thrill count was on the low side. A new three-pronged attack that was audacious in principle was subdued in practice.Ever since, the pressure has been on Didier Deschamps to abandon it and all the signs suggest he is about to throw his exciting big idea out the window. The revolution appears to have lasted one game. With Peru on the agenda for match number two Deschamps has gone back to the drawing board. “The aim is to put everyone in their best position but you have to reach a balance,” the manager said.Enter Olivier Giroud. France’s next trick is to bring back an old-fashioned focal point. The shake-up is partly about themselves and partly about their wariness of Peru’s qualities. It is time to up their game. Deschamps admitted France did not have enough energy last time out.“N’Golo Kanté told me he was struggling to breathe in the first game, struggling to move, and I understood then what was going on with the other players. If it comes from him, this is a player who likes to run a lot. So we lacked dynamism in attack but we hope to address that this time.”To Giroud or not to Giroud? That was the question that nagged and the Chelsea forward will be back leading the line, supported by the jewels Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé, with the more reliable Blaise Matuidi adding support. The aim is to bring a bit more attacking structure.Giroud is a handy metaphor for the more pragmatic style associated with Deschamps. But even if Giroud’s characteristics may not be quite as glamorous as some of the pacier options, the 31-year-old’s goalscoring record for France exceeds his reputation. He is fourth in the all-time list, behind Thierry Henry, Michel Platini and David Trezeguet. He has scored the same number of goals as Zinedine Zidane (in far fewer appearances). His goals-per-game ratio is the same as Henry’s. “When he is not there we realise just how useful he can he be,” said Deschamps pointedly.Having a natural focus for the attack is proving beneficial for some of the teams who have started this World Cup on the up. Russia’s Artem Dzyuba, Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo and England’s Harry Kane are in that bracket.If Giroud’s presence is designed to serve a purpose, even more expectation is heaped on the shoulders of Peru’s Paolo Guerrero. He is expected to come back into the starting lineup and his appearance at this World Cup owes something to the captains of the opposing teams in Group C, who signed a letter in support of him while he fought a ban after a positive drug test. “Being able to play in a World Cup is unique, it’s very special in a player’s career, and that is the case for Guerrero,” the France captain, Hugo Lloris, said. “It was only an act of solidarity with another player.”Peru’s record scorer is ready, despite joining the squad late because of his unusual situation. “Guerrero is fully fit he is not constrained in any way,” Ricardo Gareca said.The Peru manager is in bullish mood. His team thrilled but started off with a defeat by Denmark, which puts their status in the group on a knife edge.“We are going to go out to try to win the game,” Gareca said. “We are used to being the underdog, to living on the edge. And there is an element of luck to games. I think we can beat anyone, we have the tools to win and we know how to handle ourselves in this extreme situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12c9448fee298f415c8df4a431abcfe2983cb353/653_200_2308_1384/master/2308.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8de34eaa10b0682797ad755c6e4d4b56","title":"javier hernandez pleads with mexico fans to stop homophobic puto slur","story":"The Mexico striker Javier Hernández has appealed to his country’s fans to stop their homophobic chanting at World Cup matches, arguing it could lead to further fines from Fifa. Hernández posted a message on Instagram on Wednesday asking fans to end their derogatory chants during their opponents’ goal-kicks. “To all Mexican fans in the stadiums, don’t shout puto,” Hernández said. “Let’s not risk another sanction.” Mexico caused a major shock by beating Germany 1-0 in their opening game in Group F. They next play South Korea on Saturday. Mexicans have long shouted the word – slang for a male sex worker – which gay rights groups argue is homophobic. Although the Mexican team has appealed before for an end to the chants – the players even released a video on the subject in 2016 – some supporters have not relented. Thousands of Mexican fans have flooded into Russia for the World Cup and some chanted the abuse during the match against Germany on Sunday, prompting Fifa to announce disciplinary procedures earlier this week. The Mexican football federation (FMF) was sanctioned 12 times for fans’ homophobic chanting during the World Cup qualifying campaign, receiving warnings for the first two offences and fines for 10 more.The chant was also widely heard at Mexico games in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, when FIFA took no action, but the governing body has since launched a clamp-down. Other Latin American teams, including Argentina and Chile, have also been fined. Fifa is employing three specialist observers at each World Cup match to report discriminatory behaviour by spectators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db49f9894f33d5c17b81ee601f126884ebd1897/0_34_1140_684/master/1140.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7c211a4db72b9320f126bbe68b39cd","title":"kasper schmeichel denmark australia","story":"The Schmeichel family have made so much history during their glittering goalkeeping careers that neither Kasper nor Peter realised another record had fallen during Denmark’s defeat of Peru in their opening game.Kasper, by keeping a clean sheet on his World Cup debut, edged past his father in the number of minutes played for Denmark without conceding a goal. A man-of-the-match performance took him to 533 minutes unbeaten, a fact pointed out to him by statisticians. But it is victory, not personal glory, he will be striving for when Denmark play Australia in a decisive match in Group C on Thursday.“I spoke to my dad afterwards but I don’t think either one of us was aware of it,” he said. “Clean sheets is a misleading statistic. It gives you the platform to win a game but you can lead 5-0 and concede a goal. It’s a personal record which is nice but it’s not important. The important statistic is the number of games you win.”Schmeichel was praised by Denmark’s coach, Åge Hareide, for making six saves as they narrowly edged out Peru 1-0 in a performance that lacked spark in other areas. “It’s good to have a good goalkeeper, let me put it that way,” he said. Hareide acknowledged his team will have to improve if they are to beat Australia at the Samara Arena.The Socceroos have naturally identified Christian Eriksen as the danger man, with their Huddersfield midfielder, Aaron Mooy, saying stopping the Tottenham talisman will be key. Hareide was confident Eriksen would perform despite the focus on him.“Christian is a player who can change matches and we try to get him involved as much as we can,” Hareide said. “The opponents, they are going to be very cautious and careful about him, but he is used to that, isn’t he, from the Premier League. We hope that we will get him up to a good level and that he will be able to show good things at this World Cup.”Schmeichel concurred. “It goes without saying Christian is a world-class player and we are very lucky he is Danish – I’m very happy about that,” he said. “He was important to us through qualification and continues to be important. He is very down to earth – you wouldn’t think he’s a world-class player.”Samara’s gleaming out-of-town stadium will be teeming with Australia fans, who vastly outnumber the Danes. Only 900 Danish fans are expected at the game compared with 12,000 supporters who have travelled from Australia. “We have seen the videos of people celebrating back home so we have a lot of backing,” Schmeichel said. “Some of our families also tried to get to Russia but had problems with visas and travel.”The Denmark squad is depleted by one after the Ipswich defender Jonas Knudsen was flown home by private plane to be with his wife, who has just given birth. He was an unused substitute against Peru."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a95789b4e9eb79480d9a08c962d922f5a912703/0_33_2336_1401/master/2336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecdf4832792d114d9d4578fa79ab6b79","title":"portugal morocco world cup group b match report","story":"Fernando Santos had wanted to see more from his supporting cast but, well, as long as the Portugal manager has Cristiano Ronaldo, it is probably not essential. Ronaldo did what Ronaldo does. He got into dangerous areas, he scored and he was decisive.It did not matter that this was not a vintage Portugal performance, nor that they were often made to chase the ball. They got the job done and they have one foot in the second round. Ronaldo’s goal came early and, after his hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with Spain, he is leading the running for the Golden Boot.Ronaldo is now Europe’s all-time leading scorer at international level with 85 goals, having surpassed Ferenc Puskas. Iran’s Ali Daei, with 109, is the only player in world football to have outscored him.“Cristiano is like a port wine,” Santos said. “He knows how to refine his capacity and age at his best. He is constantly evolving, contradictorily to the other players. What he does now is not what he did three or four years ago, and not what he will be doing in a few years from now.”What Morocco would have given for some of Ronaldo’s cutting edge. They had none and that is why their first World Cup since 1998 is over, which is a shame because there was much to like about Hervé Renard’s team. Driven by Nordin Amrabat and Hakim Ziyech, the wide midfielders, they boldly carried the fight to a counterattacking opponent and wove plenty of eye-catching patterns. But when the chances came, all of them in the second half, they blew each one.Ronaldo is all about end product. Morocco are not. “Those who know how to play in the penalty box – and the most gifted players – make all the difference,” Renard said, which summed it up.Ronaldo’s bravery has never been in question and the goal came when he plunged into a header as the boot of Karim El Ahmadi wafted about his ears. Portugal had worked a short corner routine, allowing João Moutinho to whip in the outswinger, and Ronaldo’s connection was true, unlike Morocco’s marking. It was unusual for Renard’s team to be so loose.Renard was upset that Pepe’s challenge on Khalid Boutaïb towards the near post went unchecked. “The first foul came from Boutaïb,” Santos retorted. “If not a goal, it would have to be a penalty.”Morocco were in the last-chance saloon after their 1-0 loss to Iran but remained determined to play their high-tempo passing game, heavy on movement and pace in wide areas. They looked slick and they got in behind the Portugal defence.Amrabat was a symbol of their spirit. Having been concussed in the Iran game five days earlier, he played wearing head protection but he cast it aside in the early stages. “He’s a warrior,” Renard said. Fifa is sure to be unimpressed: its protocols suggest a minimum of six days between a concussion and returning to play.Amrabat shouted for a penalty in the 26th minute, having wriggled past Raphaël Guerreiro. They were grabbing at each other before Amrabat went down but neither the referee, Mark Geiger, nor his VAR team were moved to act. Guerreiro could be seen to inspect a set of scratch marks across his side after the incident.Renard wanted to know why a pitch-side review was not carried out and he and his players complained when José Fonte cleaned out Boutaïb in an aerial challenge inside the area shortly afterwards. Again, no censure.Mehdi Benatia could not react at the far post to convert a flick-on in first-half stoppage time but Portugal had the clearer chances before the interval. Following a surging run by Guerreiro, Ronaldo dragged narrowly wide of the far post Ronaldo also played in Gonçalo Guedes, who was denied by Munir El Kajoui Mohamedi.There was needle between Benatia and Ronaldo, which first sparked when the Juventus defender went through the back of the Portugal forward on 26 minutes, treading on his foot in the process. Benatia was booked for another tackle from behind on him later in the first half.Morocco continued to push after the break and Santos was sufficiently concerned to change from 4-4-2 to 4-5-1. “I’m not happy with my team’s performance,” he said. “We couldn’t really have the ball and create pressure. We\u0026nbspneed more possession. For Morocco, it is perhaps an unfair result but if you make a goal, you win.”Morocco had their openings and only a wonderful ing save by Rui Patrício, the new Wolves signing, kept out Younès Belhanda’s flicked header. Twice Benatia made smart moves inside the area only to shoot wildly, while Ziyech cut inside and saw Pepe deflect his effort over the crossbar.It was not all perfect from Ronaldo. He blasted two free-kicks from the edge of the area into the wall and he skied horribly after running on to an inviting chance. There was also the moment towards the end when he initiated contact inside the area and went down. He was lucky not to be booked. But, yet again, Ronaldo had found the way\u0026nbspto win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c668218c77bf901b1fb4e6f96dfac7ff9f40df1/0_108_4085_2451/master/4085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f61ff76641c651effcbac242974c58f","title":"uruguay saudi arabia world cup group a match report","story":"Luis Suárez marked his 100th international cap by sending Uruguay into the last 16 of the World Cup after benefiting from some poor goalkeeping to eliminate Saudi Arabia with a 1-0 win .The Barcelona forward tapped in the only goal of the game midway through\u0026nbspthe first half after the Saudi keeper, Mohammed al-Owais, failed to get a fist to the ball from a corner. The goal put Uruguay second in Group A with a maximum six points and ensured qualification to the knockout phase as Saudi Arabia, who have not won a World Cup game since their debut in 1994, have yet to pick up a\u0026nbsppoint.Suárez’s goal was by no means the prettiest of his career but it was enough to secure the three points. “All we wanted to do was to win and qualify for the next round,” he said. “Today was another demonstration that it is so difficult to win a game in a World Cup. This World Cup is proving that what matters most is the result and we’re very proud to have reached the last 16 for the third time in a row.”At least Suárez, who missed three good opportunities in Uruguay’s opening win against Egypt, was at his efficient best with his 52nd international goal. And this tournament has already proved a lot better than four years ago when he bit Giorgio Chiellini and was sent home and banned for four months from all football-related activity.The Uruguay defender Diego Godín\u0026nbspspoke before the tournament about how the squad felt that Suárez had been “kicked out like a dog” and were keen to do much better than in Brazil, when they were knocked out by Colombia in the last 16.They are in a good position to do so now with qualification from thegroup ensured with one gameremaining.The Uruguay coach, Óscar Tabárez, said: “We never thought that it would be easy. This is the World Cup and every team is strong. The game against Russia is now a very important test to try to see an improvement in the\u0026nbspteam.”Asked about the performance of Suárez after the forward’s lacklustre display against Morocco, he said: “Today Suárez was better than in the first game. He worked for the team, made the goal and is a player who is very generous with the team in his work ethic. He assumes the pressure with which he lives permanently and that makes him different.”Tabárez, who has chronic neuropathy and cannot walk unaided, has now taken Uruguay into the knockout phase of the World Cup for a remarkable fourth time.Saudi Arabia, who endured a minor\u0026nbspscare when an engine on their plane caught fire before landing in Rostov on Monday, have now failed to score in their last four World Cup games. After a 5-0 demolition at the hands of Russia in the tournament’s opening game, they performed better here but were ultimately shown up as\u0026nbsptoothless.Uruguay’s Edinson Cavani wasted numerous chances, including one in the 14th minute when he skied a half-volley over the bar. The stadium burst into life in the 23rd minute, however,\u0026nbspwhen an unmarked Suárez\u0026nbspcoolly tapped into an unguarded net from a corner kick after Owais came out but misjudged his jump and could not reach the ball. Suárez has now scored in three consecutive World Cups.The Saudis continued to move the ball around but barely threatened a typically gritty Uruguay defence. The second half was even scrappier, with Saudi Arabia too limited going forward to trouble their opponents, who were happy to hold on to their narrow advantage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf92319cefb9e36a99d9a0a4546bfc6e1a8779a0/21_346_4271_2562/master/4271.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a85829fd65d7a7ff83c02ca2613a6755","title":"world cup energised russia becomes one nation under a chant","story":"They chanted it inside the St Petersburg Stadium on Tuesday night. They chanted it in Moscow, above ground in the fan zone and below, in the metro. They chanted it in the restaurants and bars, and later, inebriated, they chanted it in the fountains. The main chant of this World Cup is not complicated. It’s the name of the host country, drawn out over three long syllables, and repeated ad infinitum: “Ros! Si! Ya!”It was Uruguay’s win against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday afternoon that confirmed Russia’s advance to the next stage, but with two wins and a goal difference of +7, Russia’s progression was all but wrapped up at the end of the Egypt game the evening before.If the proficiency of Russia’s 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia in the opening game had caused the country’s collective jaw to drop in admiration and amazement, the emphatic follow-up against Egypt found the disbelief transitioning to joy and naked patriotism.It is not just the team’s performance that is making this such a fun World Cup to experience on the streets of Moscow and other cities. The arrival of hundreds of thousands of fans from across the world, turning the centre of the capital into a never-ending carnival of smiles and dancing, has a lot to do with that. But the sheen would have been taken off the celebration had the home team played as disastrously as predicted.The attitude towards the national team had been summed up by a popular meme doing the rounds on social media in the days before kick-off. A sign in a pub showed different footballers using the toilet: Cristiano Ronaldo curling it in from a distance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic urinating backwards overhead-kick style. The graphic for the Russia team was simple: a man standing in a puddle of his own piss.The grim pessimism of Russian supporters was hardly surprising. This, after all, was a team who had not won in seven matches and looked sluggish and uninspiring in the warmup matches. Just before the tournament, the veteran defender Sergei Ignashevich, who turns 39 in July and looked dangerously slow even at the Euros two years ago, was recalled to the squad and put in the starting lineup.Despite all the ominous portents, the action on the pitch has been a revelation, with two wins that have exceeded the expectations of even the most patriotic optimists. True, Russia’s opponents so far have been a woefully inept Saudi side and Egypt with a half-fit Mo Salah, but Russia could only play the opponents put in front of them, and it is worth remembering that according to Fifa rankings, Russia were a worse side than Saudi Arabia.Russia have never qualified for the knockout stage of the World Cup – the last time it happened was in 1986 when the country was still the Soviet Union. The last time a Russian or Soviet side won their two opening games at the tournament was 1966, an indication of just what a start the hosts have managed this time.Football is not a national obsession in Russia, with most people only taking notice during rare successes such as the run to the semi-finals of Euro 2008. “I think half the country will find out that we have a World Cup when the whistle blows,” the coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, said before the tournament. “It takes a long time for us to start driving but I think when we press the foot on the pedal, we go all the way.”That is now starting to happen, as those who were previously disdainful of the national side or apathetic begin to rally around the flag. At the Luzhniki on Wednesday afternoon, as a capacity crowd watched Portugal beat Morocco, there were loud cheers for Ronaldo’s goal from one end but the loudest roar of all was a few minutes into the second half, when the inevitable chant of “Ros! Si! Ya!” went up from the locals sitting in all four sides of the stadium.Over the past few years, patriotism in Russia has been isive, with the chest-beating and flag-waving over the annexation of Crimea in 2014 making some of the liberal minority queasy about patriotism. Viktor Shenderovich, a Russian satirist and radio host who is strongly critical of the Kremlin, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday: “Great match, the lads were brilliant, we deserved victory. But then you listen to the patriotic hysteria on the state channels – ‘WE DID IT’ – and you brain tells your heart: you’ve been used again. All very predictable.”But for many, the performance of the national team appears to have rehabilitated the flag, providing a form of patriotism the whole country can rally behind. Igor Rabiner, one of Russia’s leading football journalists, wrote in the Sport Express newspaper that more Russians are interested in winning than are interested in football per se, but said history was being made: “The young people who are waving flags and shouting: ‘Russia’ will remember all of this 50 years from now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36388bd65276358314328e6330687a74f9d3f83/0_143_4073_2445/master/4073.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21a5a8a82f1e52abe9d3c8edc85847e9","title":"uruguay v saudi arabia world cup 2018 live","story":"Luis Suarez scored the only goal to book Uruguay’s passage to the knockout stages with a game to spareLuis Suarez scored the winner as Uruguay booked their passage to the knockout stages with a match to spare.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over and Uruguay take the points courtesy of Luis Suarez’s first-half tap-in. It was a dull, dull game but Uruguay fans won’t care. Their side is through to the last 16 and will play Russia to see who tops the group.90+4 min: Al-Faraj tries to pump the ball into the Uruguay penalty area from deep, but it’s cleared. And now it’s all over - Uruguay have won.90+3 min: Uruguay have a corner, which they are in no hurry to take. Suarez takes it short and is then harshly penalised for just trying to protect the ball. 90+1 min: The clock ticks on and Saudi Arabia’s hopes of making the knockout stages are fast evaporating. Their match against Egypt in the Volgograd Arena will have nothing at stake but pride. 90 min: In a word: no. Al-Faraj sends the ball deep and Kano gets his head to it. He has to lean backwards, however, and steers a very weak header into the welcoming arms of Muslera. 89 min: A corner for Saudi Arabia! Can they salvage something? 86 min: Cavani brings a smart save out of Mohammad Al-Owais with a shot. 84 min: Uruguay continue to lead by the only goal of the game, but Saudi Arabia look like they could play for another two hours and fail to trouble the scoreboard operator. They need a goal or they are out of the World Cup.82 min: Uruguay substitution: Nahitan Nandez on for Carlos Sanchez. 80 min: Lucas Torreira shoots from distance and sees his shot take a deflection off Cavani. The ball drops just wide of the far corner after threatening briefly to go in the goal. 77 min: Sanchez curls a free-kick into the Saudi Arabia penalty area, where three defenders take swipes at the ball and fail to clear it. It finds its way to Caceres, who shoots goalwards. His effort hits Godin and the offside flag is hoisted. Slapstick defending from the Saudis and not for the first time at a set piece.77 min: Saudi Arabia substitution: Mohammad Kano on for Hatan Bahbir.74 min: Saudi Arabia get forward ... then go backwards again. “They just look like a team that loves keeping possession but have no interest in doing anything with it,” says Phil Neville on BBC co-comms. “What they seem to forget is that there’s a set of goals at one end of the pitch that they need to get the ball into.”72 min: Inside the last 20 minutes and another goal seems unlikely. And if Fate considers me to be putting temptation her way, she’s welcome to make a fool of me. 68 min: Martin Caceres gets above Salem Al-Dawsari to head a Carlos Sanchez corner over the Saudi Arabia cross-bar.66 min: Hattan Bahbir whips the ball towards goal, but it’s headed clear by Luis Suarez. Al-Faraj returns the ball to the Saudi penalty area, but Muslera gathers comfortably in the absence of any opposing players. 65 min: Free-kick for Uruguay wide on the right for a foul on Carlos Sanchez. He takes it himself and his delivery is atrocious - Saudi Arabia gallop up the field on the counter-attack. Al-Mulwallad takes on Gimenez down the left flank and is upended. Free-kick for Saudi Arabia, wide on the left.62 min: Uruguay take a quick free-kick from deep inside their own half, with Martin Cacares playing the ball in behind from deep. Edinson Cavani chases it down and holds it up for a few seconds, before curling a wonderful cross towards Carlos Sanchez at the far post. He wins the header, but sends the ball over the bar. He should have scored.60 min: Laxalt makes an ealry impact, going close to scoring with his first touch since coming on as he stretches to try and volley home. 59 min: Uruguay double-substitution: Lucas Torreira and Diego Laxalt on for Matias Vecino and Cristian Rodriguez. 56 min: Assorted Uruguay players control possession and ping the ball about in midfield before getting forward. Martin Cacares loses the ball and Saudi Arabia embark on a counter-attack, which quickly breaks down.55 min: Move along now, nothing much to see here.  51 min: A cross from deep is headed back across the face of Uruguay’s goal by Mohammad Al-Breik. Fernando Muslera claims comfortably. 49 min: Saudi Arabia concede a free-kick five or six yards outside their own penalty area after Carlos Sanchez takes a e and cons the referee. Luis Suarez shoots, but his effort his batted away by Mohammed Al-Owais. 47 min: Saudi Arabia get forward, with the first-half substitute Al-Moghawi attempting to cross from the left. His effort is blocked. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes in personnel on either side. Peep! It’s half-time and Uruguay lead courtesy of a Luis Suarez tap-in on the back of a goalkeeping blooper from Mohammed Al-Owais. It was not a half of football that will live long in the memory, but Saudi Arabia have done OK and will fancy their chances of getting an equaliser.44 min: Saudi Arabia substitution: Housain Al-Mogahwi on, Taisir Al-Jassam off. “I wouldn’t have gone back on,” says Phil Neville. “When your hamstring’s gone you get off and get somebody else on.” 43 min: Al-Jassam is helped off the pitch and promptly pushed back on by his manager while his replacement gets ready. He walks back on to the pitch and immediately sits down on the turf. 41 min: Saudi Arabia midfielder Taisir Al-Jassam stretches to win the ball and goes down clutching his thigh. Contesting the ball with him, Gimenez immediately signals to the Saudi bench that their man has done his hammy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b0f41a01a3e592a66c202d65b1c2383549fb15f/0_124_1840_1104/master/1840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4957d792fedebee79265bc9c2315708","title":"kakigori a sweet fun and obama approved shaved ice dessert","story":"A Japanese dish that has found fame in Hawaii and looks like a work of art. The challenge is to get as much as you can in the bowlCome summer, the challenge is to find something cold, yet new. Sculpting shaved ice is both job and hobby for Mauricio Faria, the 28-year-old manager of Soho’s Honi Poké. “I like to make little mountains with the ice, to build it up, carve a winding road round the edge and then drizzle mango puree round it.” Faria shows me how, dragging his finger gingerly over a 15cm-high pile of shaved ice in a plastic pot. “It’s like the yellow brick road,” he says. “I can also make Christmas trees.”Honi Poké specialises in poké bowls, a Hawaiian speciality, but has also started selling shaved ice, which is another. The poké attracts a queue round the block most lunchtimes but its kakigōri, the Japanese name for the shaved ice dessert (which originated in Japan), is new. It’s more of a sleeper hit they sell around 10 a day at the moment, which leaves plenty of time for practice. Faria builds his mini Hepworths three times a day. “It’s all about ratios,” he says. “You want enough puree but you don’t want to drown it, and you don’t want it to melt.”The ice is shaved using a “Hatsuyuki” machine (which means “first snow” in Japanese). A block of ice is placed inside and locked into place then a handle is pulled and shaved ice falls out from a funnel at the front. You can change the sizing on a micro scale. The ice is then packed into a mound by gloved hands and different purees are added. I try mango and guanabana elsewhere they add sprinkles or condensed milk.Finished, it looks like a work of art and it has many, many draws. I mainly like its amphibiousness – it’s both ice and dessert, like eating a drink, wet and cold, sweet and fun. Also, if you ever wondered what 44 calories tasted like (I haven’t), then this is it. The sizing is the most crucial thing. Powder hounds, who ski on Okushiga Kogen’s slopes, will note the granular differences. The bigger the shards, the less purchase the puree has on the ice. The challenge is to get as much as you can into the bowl. It’s messy, but it’s catching on: another London Japanese restaurant, Sosharu, sells a version that comes with sweetened red beans.It is thought shaved ice arrived on the Hawaiian islands in the 1800s, via sugar plantation workers from Japan. There, it dates back to the royal families of the Heian period. Barack Obama is a big fan. His annual Island Snow shave ice, which he has on holiday in Kailua, has become a paparazzi tradition (apparently, he has it with melon, cherry and lime). And snow cones have been big in the US for decades.Kakigōri is very much shaved ice that is designed for photographing, but it also trolls the fool who tries to shoot it and eat it before it melts. “I like to lose myself in it,” says Faria. “To turn my back to the crowds and just ... It’s like pottery.” He smiles: “We’ve all seen Ghost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120a66641616869e7acaba94dcc789a727545413/0_594_4434_2660/master/4434.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a40ce2b947817efad5186c6b3fd913","title":"us lobbyist for russian oligarch visited julian assange nine times last year","story":"It is unclear whether Adam Waldman’s 2017 visits had connection to Oleg DeripaskaA longtime US lobbyist for the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska visited Julian Assange nine times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London last year, according to visitor logs seen by the .Adam Waldman, who has worked as a Washington lobbyist for the metals tycoon since 2009, had more meetings with Assange in 2017 than almost anyone else, the records show.It is not clear why Waldman went to the WikiLeaks founder or whether the meetings had any connection to the Russian billionaire, who is now subject to US sanctions. But the disclosure is likely to raise further questions about the extent and nature of Assange’s alleged ties to Russia.US intelligence agencies concluded with “high confidence” last year, in an unclassified intelligence assessment, that the Kremlin shared hacked emails with WikiLeaks that undermined Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign as part of its effort to sway the 2016 election in favour of Donald Trump.Waldman is a lawyer and consultant in Washington and Deripaska’s primary lobbyist. He also represents other clients including Hollywood stars. Last year Deripaska paid Waldman about $562,000. According to filings to the Department of Justice (DoJ) by Waldman’s firm, the Endeavor Group, his work for Deripaska focused on advising the oligarch’s company UC Rusal on legal issues.When Deripaska first hired him, in 2009, Waldman’s firm was on a $40,000-per-month retainer. The Russian magnate was having problems obtaining a visa because of alleged connections to organised crime, which Deripaska denies. Waldman lobbied the US government to get Deripaska a visa.Waldman also served as a counsel for Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. A 2010 DoJ filing showed that the Endeavor Group was hired by Lavrov to help ease the “persistent state of limbo” that Deripaska faced as a result of his being refused entry into the US. In a letter to Waldman, Lavrov hailed Deripaska as one of Russia’s “prominent business leaders”.Waldman declined to answer questions from the  about his meetings with Assange or whether they were connected to the Russian billionaire.Waldman has not registered himself as a lobbyist for the WikiLeaks founder.A report last year by Fox News, which obtained leaked text messages between Waldman and the US senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, suggested Waldman tried to broker a deal between Assange and the DoJ and that the negotiations were fruitless. It is not clear whether Waldman was brokering the deal on Assange’s behalf or someone else’s. The logs, obtained by the  and Focus Ecuador, reveal details of Assange’s life inside the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has been staying since June 2012. Waldman allegedly visited Assange twice on 12 and 13 January 2017, days before Trump’s inauguration as president, and again immediately after the ceremony, on 27 January. has separately corroborated that Waldman was in London in late March, when he saw Assange twice more. He visited the embassy three times in April and made two more visits at the end of November 2017. Deripaska is a key person in the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.In summer 2016, when he was Trump’s campaign chief, Manafort offered Deripaska a confidential briefing, emails turned over to Congress and Mueller show. The briefing never happened, Manafort says. Deripaska was filmed soon afterwards on his luxury yacht discussing the forthcoming US election with Russia’s deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko.Deripaska was subjected to more US sanctions in April. They were imposed on close associates of Putin’s in retaliation for alleged Kremlin meddling in the US vote. Meanwhile, Manafort faces multiple charges of money laundering arising from his work in Ukraine, and accusations of tampering with potential witnesses. He denies all charges. His bail was revoked last week and he is now awaiting trial in prison.Waldman’s relationship with Deripaska goes beyond consultancy. According to filings, in 2008 he travelled to Moscow, Amsterdam and Siberia with the oligarch for the purpose of “friendship”. In 2015 Waldman and his German second wife, Barbara Sturm, posed for photos with Deripaska at Munich’s Oktoberfest. Sturm, a dermatologist and beauty expert, has a major business presence in Russia.In April Waldman placed an article by Deripaska with the conservative Daily Caller news website, sources say. The oligarch called allegations of collusion “invented” and said he and the Russian government were victims of a “deep state” Washington plot. Waldman has cultivated connections with senior Democratic politicians and spent summers with many of them in Martha’s Vineyard. According to filings, Deripaska has paid Waldman via a series of offshore firms, with cash routed via shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize and Jersey. At least one of Deripaska’s companies, Sea Chaika Corporation, appears in the Panama Papers. In 2010 it transferred at least $85,000 to Waldman’s accounts. Sea Chaika is connected to anonymous firms registered in Cyprus. Deripaska and UC Rusal did not comment. Assange has denied the hacked Democratic party emails released by WikiLeaks in 2016 came from Moscow.Last month Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, said Assange could continue to live in the embassy as long as he complied with the conditions of his stay and avoided voicing political opinions on Twitter. In March, Moreno restricted Assange’s visitors, cut his internet access and shelved a $5m (£3.7m) secret spy operation to protect him, called “Operation Hotel”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa265726be055f43dbc9e7eaa1e7c7fbc0bd50e/0_200_3384_2029/master/3384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ac9e352d75a94f0e2ec621b4c89b51","title":"david bowie aladdin sane allbum photograph donated victoria albert museum","story":"Archive of photographer Brian Duffy donates print to museum that held record-breaking showA photograph from the photo session for David Bowie’s 1973 album Aladdin Sane has been gifted to the V\u0026ampA as it announced record visitor figures for its world-touring David Bowie is exhibition.The V\u0026ampA said on Wednesday that the archive of the late photographer Brian Duffy had donated a print of a colour transparency image, from the photo session that led to one of the world’s most recognisable album covers.The gift celebrates a milestone for the V\u0026ampA’s Bowie show, which will welcome its 2-millionth visitor during its run at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, the final stage of a world tour that began five years ago.Duffy was one of the “terrible trio”, or “Black Trinity”, of photographers who helped capture the vibrancy of London in the swinging sixties and beyond. With fellow East Enders David Bailey and Terence Donovan, Duffy brought new ideas and a new energy to celebrity photography.The Aladdin Sane image, an orange haired Bowie with a red and blue painted lightning flash painted on his face, is one of Duffy’s most famous.Chris Duffy, son of Brian and director of the Duffy Archive, said it “is one of the best known and most copied images of the late 20th century. Today, it is instantly recognised around the world.“My father greatly enjoyed his unique creative partnership with David. I think he would be delighted that his work is joining the V\u0026ampA’s collection and that it has contributed to the continuing public interest in one of the UK’s great creative forces.”The gift was welcomed by the culture secretary Matt Hancock who said it celebrated “David Bowie’s seismic cultural importance and the huge contribution Brian Duffy made to 20th century photography.”The V\u0026ampA’s exhibition is the museum’s most visited international touring show in its 165-year history.

A bastion of leftwing activism and DIY arts, its supporters, particularly the legendary “Ultras”, are one of the western world’s most politically and culturally engaged fanbases, and the club is particularly beloved of punk and underground music fans. “St Pauli is unlike any other club,” says Tim McIlrath, frontman of American melodic hardcore band, Rise Against. “We went to their stadium, and to see ‘No Football for Fascists’ painted across the stand, to see them encouraging more girls playing football – it’s fascinating. I was looking for a club that transcends sport – St Pauli is a model of that.”It’s late May, and FCSP are hosting Antira Sankt Pauli 2018. Antira for short, it is an annual international anti-racist football tournament to which progressive, fan-led global teams are invited. As the 2018 World Cup begins, promising to be a carefully orchestrated showcase of Putin’s Russia, this inclusive, DIY contest is an interesting counterpoint to the Fifa pageant. “Everybody in Europe should be concerned about the new far-right movement,” club president Oke Göttlich tells me inside the club’s Millerntor-Stadion. “We are not a party, we only can make our values heard. But we all need to stand strong. If St Pauli can play a little role in that, we are as happy as if we won a football match.”From the outset, the atmosphere is jubilant, as enthusiastic participants waste little time in introducing themselves to one another, buying rounds and cheering each team (male, female and mixed) equally. I spend most of my time with East London’s Clapton Ultras, who praise the sense of community that they’ve found in this network of politicised sporting groups. “We’ll probably get beaten a lot though,” one player shrugs. “Because some of the other teams are actually … fit.”True, this is hardly the most technically impressive football tournament I’ve watched, but it’s also the only one at which pints of lager are passed along the touchline between substitutes. The setting, though, is exceptional: a manicured Bundesliga 2 pitch in a 32,000-capacity stadium, adorned with progressive slogans (“no human is illegal”, “football has no gender”). There’s a decent showing from British sides: Republica Leeds win the women-only competition, and Bristol’s Easton Cowboys claim the mixed-gender title alongside Berlin’s TeBe Party Army. Yet these victories seem beside the point: at the closing ceremony, each team presents another with a gift, each of roughly equal value.Away from the pitch, the Millerntor-Stadion and the surrounding area play host to a number of non-footballing events, including a workshop at which representatives of each team detail their concerns about the far-right in their homelands. DJs pump hardcore punk, ska, dub and electro through a soundsystem overlooking the pitch, and on Saturday evening, we’re treated to sets from Italian punks Bull Brigade, Connecticut rapper Ceschi Ramos, and Stuttgart ska band No Sports. Each night, after the official Antira events have concluded, I’m whisked off by locals to various other DIY events around the area, further underlining St Pauli’s deep-seated musical connections. I find myself at two techno parties, the first in a cavernous community centre in Altona, and another in Flakturm IV, a former Nazi air defence bunker. A hulking mass of concrete and steel designed to withstand allied bombing, Flakturm IV dwarfs the Millerntor. Once inside, we’re nodded through a back door for a look from the roof of the building, thanks to the bouncers’ relationship with the Ultras leading our group. Apparently FCSP Ultras are often employed as security staff in Hamburg because “they’re intelligent, but know how to fight”.There’s a sense of urgency in many artists’s statements about FCSP. “To stand for ideals together with FCSP is a big honour for us,” says Dema, frontman of Italian ska-punks Talco. “Especially to spread antifascist and antiracist views in a society in which the important and real things are brought out of focus.” Rise Against’s McIlrath adds: “Sport can provide sanctuary to a lot of rightwing motivations and hooliganism – FCSP taking a proactive stand against that is exciting.” And as one middle-aged Ultra tells me, FCSP supporters’ musical interests go beyond punk and metal. In the 1980s and 90s, many Ultras eschewed “cheesy German punk” for dub and reggae. His sentiment still holds – many of the younger supporters have little to do with rock and are active in Hamburg’s DIY techno, house and Afrobeat scenes.It’s increasingly rare to see a subculture blossom to this extent, certainly in the middle of a major western European city. Yet it’s writ large across Hamburg, even away from its nucleus in St Pauli. One factor may be the German government’s fiscal attitude to culture: as Arts Council England’s year-on-year budget reduction since 2010 continues with a further cut of £156m by 2022, German culture minister Monika Grütters has proposed an increase to national arts funding of €302m (£256m) a year.Affordable housing plays a part too – in 2015, Hamburg’s local authority became the first in the world to pass a law allowing the seizure of empty commercial properties in order to house migrants. Unlike London’s more covert equivalent, the city’s squat scene is not only well-known, but highly visible, particularly around such landmarks as the Rote Flora. This results in lower rents and far more public land, affording residents more time and space to engage with art, politics and charity. Combined with a port economy that relies heavily on unionised industry, and given a social institution around which to congregate – FC St Pauli – counterculture has thrived.However, this is not an uncomplicated, wholly positive situation. I’m not alone in noticing a disconnect between the tournament’s messages and its demographic the vast majority of people here are white, more often male than female, and although there may well have been a significant LGBT+ contingent in attendance, their presence was rarely explicit. And this subculture does not exist in a peaceful, progressive bubble. Clashes between FCSP fans and far-right hooligans are commonplace, and the Ultras are famously active in antifascist violence. Furthermore, the Millerntor sits, quite literally, between two problematic issues: the gentrification of St Pauli, which forces its resident subculture away, and the organised crime that’s bolstered by the red-light district around the Reeperbahn. There are real tensions here.Nevertheless, a subculture on this scale, encompassing music, sport and politics, feels refreshing in 2018, particularly given the grassroots work that FCSP does for refugee and antifascist causes. Without this subculture, those good deeds may go undone without comparable subcultures, who knows what else we’d lose? As Göttlich says, “If a musician is not working closely with his fans, the musician will disappear. A fan community is something to nurture. Our fans don’t always do everything right, but they are what make St Pauli special.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d295635bf1164d7950e775878666250bc268786/45_0_3173_1904/master/3173.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8fde9a229bfa58f3630d64c937584eb","title":"private emails show dft contempt for rail users says mp","story":"Labour’s Lisa Nandy says ministers and officials were warned over timetable changesPrivate emails sent between government officials after warnings of impending rail chaos in the north of England show “complete disrespect and contempt” for passengers, an MP has said. Documents released after a freedom of information request to the Department for Transport, and passed to the Labour MP for Wigan, Lisa Nandy, show discussions between officials after passenger groups warned more than two years ago that planned changes to train routes would result in widespread disruption.One email, from October 2015, suggested the line from Southport to Leeds was “not really a ‘valued’ connection” but should be kept as “a sop” to people in Southport as they were likely to lose their direct link to Manchester airport. Since Northern rail introduced a new timetable on 20 May there have been mass cancellations and delayed services on some of its lines. Northern, a subsidiary of Arriva, has blamed the disruption on delayed engineering works and a shortage of trained drivers.Nandy said the correspondence revealed that while locals were being told their concerns over proposed changes were being listened to, privately the decisions had already been made.“It paints a picture of a group of people sitting in London carving up our railways, with not only no regard for people’s lives but real disrespect and contempt for the people using the railways,” she said. “There is no regard shown at all for the lived experience of people in the north of England.”Speaking at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Nandy said: “Four weeks of Northern rail chaos – passengers in the north of England have had enough. The government has said Network Rail didn’t deliver and that Northern wasn’t prepared.“But I have been handed emails from within the Department for Transport that show that ministers and officials were warned of impending chaos as long ago as two years ago. These emails are a disgrace.”The timetable changes in May resulted in the cancellation of most of the direct services between Southport and Manchester Piccadilly and the airport. Nandy said she and local passenger groups had warned that the change would result in dangerous overcrowding at Salford Crescent station as people changed trains to get to south Manchester. She received a letter from the transport minister Jo Johnson in February 2018 stating that “peak services to Manchester Piccadilly will still go ahead as planned”, but the emails reveal that the decision to cancel the services was seen as “pretty much inevitable” in as early as 2015.“Diversion of the Southport to Victoria is a pretty much inevitable consequence of our specification,” read one email from that year. “Paths through the Oxford Road corridor are scarce and demand flows west of Wigan are materially weaker than other places that are getting new services through that corridor.”A DfT spokesman said the emails had nothing to do with the timetabling issues experienced by Northern in recent weeks.“The emails are more than two years old and relate to the wider design of the Northern franchise and deciding which trains were most needed to best serve the passengers in the region.”They added: “It is deeply regrettable that a DfT official used inappropriate language and that matter is being looked at.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017aee012f933fa1feeef44c0ad49d17b53e2225/82_0_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ca013fad8cdceb0a0fd7ddadb7b1ae","title":"brexit theresa may faces meaningful vote crunch day politics live","story":"Follow live updates for PMQs, health secretary statement and Theresa May’s final push to head off a ‘meaningful vote’ rebellion on BrexitWe’re going to close our live coverage for the evening.

I completely respect the view of my colleagues who disagree, but if we can compromise we can achieve more.This is a disappointing result and comes after Theresa May is forced once again to try to buy off her own MPs at the eleventh hour.That’s all from me, but my colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over this evening.There was some quite heavy briefing this morning that Labour Eurosceptics and Labour MPs with leave-leaning seats could be the ones to deliver the government victory tonight, by rebelling against their party and voting against the amendment.Labour whips say they are pleased tonight that only four Labour MPs did so, all of them long-standing Brexiters. I’m told Denis Skinner, a fervent Eurosceptic but a long-standing friend and ally of Jeremy Corbyn, helped carry many waverers over the line.But Labour are clearly frustrated that a win was possible but Grieve’s concession meant it was denied. “Tory MPs had a chance to deliver a truly meaningful vote,” a source said. “Labour MPs remained united - including some being taken through the voting lobbies in wheelchairs - but the so-called Tory rebels lost the courage of their convictions and gave licence for a no deal Brexit.”There were some unedifying scenes in the Commons today as some sick and some heavily pregnant MPs had to go through the lobbies. My colleague Peter Walker has these details. One of the effects of both the vote and the decision of the government to not allow MPs’ votes to be counted merely by their presence in parliament saw curious scenes in the corridor adjoining the lobby outside the Commons.Labour MP Naz Shah was taken through in a wheelchair – she has been in hospital with severe back pain – while Laura Pidcock, her heavily-pregnant colleague, walked out from the vote and was helped away in another wheelchair.Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem deputy leader, who is two days past her birth due date, managed the walk unaided.The complications come from the fact that while MPs can be “paired” – if they are absent an opposing MP will also not vote – there is not as yet a system for proxy votes, something the Labour MP Harriet Harman has been campaigning for.There is quite a bit of anger about this from pundits and MPs.The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg says she thinks the government should be worried by how tight the vote was, even after the compromise was struck with Grieve.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has reacted to the result. There is clearly a lot of frustration on the Labour benches that a win against the government was possible.This is a disappointing result and comes after Theresa May is forced once again to try to buy off her own MPs at the eleventh hour.Labour has long argued that Parliament should have a proper role in the Brexit negotiations and a meaningful vote on the terms upon which we leave the European Union. We will continue to make that argument and press our case at every opportunity.Leading Tory Brexiter John Redwood said he was “very satisfied” with the result. “I never rashly doubted we would win, as otherwise it would frustrate the will of the British people,” he said. Asked why the Tory rebels in both houses pushed the issue so long he said: “You’ll have to ask them. But I do think the Lords made a big mistake.” It is a cruel irony that many of those making the amendments are of the generation of politicians who gave away so many powers to Brussels. And now it seems their main aim is to stop us from getting back those powers.Dominic Grieve voted against his own amendment, but six Tories voted in favour, including Philip Lee, the former justice minister who resigned in protest of the government’s Brexit strategy.Missing are several MPs who have been outspoken on Brexit, including Nicky Morgan, Stephen Hammond, Bob Neill and Jonathan Djanogly.Labour whips will be pleased that they have limited their rebels to just four.There may be some significant abstentions too, which we’ll get shortly.Dominic Grieve has spoken to my colleague Peter Walker after the result of the vote. He says he believes reaching a compromise was the right solution, even if some of his allies disagreed.We’ve managed to reach a compromise without breaking the government - and I think some people don’t realise we were getting quite close to that. I completely respect the view of my colleagues who disagree, but if we can compromise we can achieve more.The Lords amendment, drafted by Dominic Grieve, is defeated, after that last minute concession.The government won by 16 votes - it will be interesting when we get the final stats about which Tory rebels rebelled, and which Labour MPs joined them.Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake has seized on the ‘Grand Old Duke of York’ nickname.Just like the Grand Old Duke of York, Grieve has marched his troops to the top of the hill only to get cold feet and retreat with his tail between his legs.Despite the clear calamity that May and Davis are making of Brexit, the so-called Tory rebels have lost their bottle and caved into yet another pathetic government compromise that isn’t worth the paper it is written on.There are potentially far more significant battles to come on a raft of bills, including the trade bill and customs bill, where many Tory MPs have put their names to amendments on a future customs union. But the “meaningful vote” is probably the least controversial issue so it does not bode well for the success of those amendments. It seems like Labour MPs were forced to make it into Parliament from their sick beds, as was raised in the chamber in a point of order earlier. This from the Times’ Sam Coates.We expect the result in a few minutes. The government is now expected to win comfortably. Just before the vote, the Labour MP George Howarth joked in the final speech in the Commons that Dominic Grieve is “in danger of becoming the Grand Old Duke of York.”ITV’s Robert Peston has an explanation of sorts from one of the Tory would-be rebels. In essence, they believe there will always be a way to force a vote. The EU Withdrawal bill will need to go back to the Lords one final time, but we don’t expect the Lords to send it back again, meaning the legislation will finally pass. It may be as early as tonight. Anna Soubry is speaking now in the debate. She jokes she has a throat infection because the editor of the Daily Mail has a tiny doll in her image and is “sticking pins in its throat.”She says she agrees with Antoinette Sandbach’s arguments, calling her “a remarkably brave woman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f492e502b5c58f62c033af7226aa721bce0b76d0/0_49_724_434/master/724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feef104dafc85e84a26694a2b4448049","title":"plantwatch surge in hay fever rooted in our modern lifestyles","story":"This has been the worst month for hay fever for 12 years. Grasses had perfect growing conditions over late April and in May with warm sunshine and showers. That was followed in June by hot dry conditions when the grass flowers matured and shed clouds of pollen on light breezes and up people’s noses.The strange thing is that hay fever was incredibly rare when it was first reported by John Bostoc, a London doctor, nearly 200 years ago. Yet in those days far more people lived and worked in the countryside, where grasses grew everywhere. Today, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions and afflicts more than a fifth of the British population, even in towns where you might imagine grass pollen is less of a problem.This statistic has been blamed on modern lifestyles, including factors such as obsessive hygiene and excessive use of antibiotics.Above all, air pollution from traffic is a huge factor in the upsurge of hay fever. Exhaust fumes help weaken pollen grains, making them split open more easily and spew out the allergic substances that trigger the condition. And polluting gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide, also make hay fever sufferers more sensitive to pollen allergens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83d0a74b2c91ca9aaa16f69ad9f748a79e968a26/0_201_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c86f39abbddcce189fbfea12c60ff8","title":"tongue tied t rex couldnt stick out its tongue","story":"Researchers say many dinosaurs’ tongues were anchored to the floors of their mouths and unable to waggleThe fearsome creatures of Jurassic World might chase you, kill you and rip you limb from limb, but there is one thing a T rex couldn’t do: stick out its tongue.While Hollywood depictions of dinosaurs often show the creatures open-mouthed with tongues waving, researchers have discovered that many of them were probably tongue-tied, their tongues firmly anchored to the floors of their mouths and unable to waggle around.Writing in the journal Plos One, palaeontologist Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin and scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences describe how they explored the tongue-wagging abilities of dinosaurs by looking at fossils of a set of bony structures known as the hyoid that anchors the tongue in the mouth.They also looked at fossils from extinct flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, and used both x-ray CT scanning and dissection techniques to look at the tongue anatomies of alligators and living birds – including the common pheasant, emu and redhead duck.Birds have thin, mobile tongues and Y-shaped hyoids: two long, bony projections point towards the back of the mouth, and a central bony section sits in the front of the mouth with the tongue wrapped around it. Muscles attach to these bony projections, allowing birds to move their tongues and stick them out. “We take birds for granted, but they have crazy tongues,” said Clarke. “The way that tongue is able to protrude so far is that these little skinny bones are super, super long – they are so long that in a hummingbird they wrap over the surface of the skull into the nose holes.The team found that dinosaurs evolutionarily close to birds, such as microraptors, had hyoids similar to – albeit shorter than – those of modern birds. Elongated complex hyoids were also found in pterosaurs.However, the majority of dinosaurs were found to have a simple, short hyoid rather like modern alligators, whose large, fleshy tongues are fixed to the floor of their mouths, with broad, short pieces of cartilage at the back rather than the longer bony support seen in birds. This, say the researchers, suggests dinosaurs could not have waggled their tongues, let alone stuck them out. The exception, notes Clarke, was a group of plant-eating dinosaurs known as ornithischians, which includes beasts such as triceratops, who were found to have an unusual, complex hyoid. While the team say it is not clear why some dinosaurs and birds evolved more mobile tongues, they suggest it comes down to feeding habits. Crocodiles and alligators – like many meat-eating dinosaurs – do little chewing, instead opting for a “tear and gulp” approach to table manners that does not require a mobile tongue. Herbivorous dinosaurs like triceratops needed to chew, while birds have a variety of feeding habits borne of their lifestyle.“Once you have things that are eating seeds like birds, that are eating smaller prey items, then there seems to be elaboration of the tongue,” said Clarke. “Once there are wings instead of mobile forelimbs then I think there is more pressure on the tongue to participate in positioning food or food processing … moving food in the mouth.”Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research.“It turns out that most dinosaurs have the very simple hyoid bones of modern crocodiles, which anchor a tongue that is pretty much glued to the floor of the mouth,” he said. “A cousin of T rex called Yutyrannus has this type of hyoid bone, as do almost all other dinosaurs, so it’s reasonable to infer that T rex did as well.”“Those images in Jurassic Park of the T rex sticking its tongue out like a lizard as it prepares to devour its prey are probably wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5d812c1a10d62059b899b1e7a5ff5ccfb6d4e50/49_308_3255_1954/master/3255.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfca8b14d78ce0d7d00b16582ef78cd5","title":"bernard hinault tour de france strike chris froome","story":"• Riders should refuse to race, says Tour de France legend• Hinault: ‘Chris Froome should not be at the start of the Tour’Bernard Hinault, the five-times winner of the Tour de France, has called on riders in this year’s race to strike in protest at the presence of Chris Froome, who is awaiting the outcome of an adverse analytical finding for the asthma drug salbutamol.Since news of the test result from a sample taken during his victory in the Vuelta a España in 2017 was published in the  in November, Froome, the defending Tour champion, has maintained his innocence of any wrongdoing and reiterated his certainty that he will be cleared when the case is resolved.Speaking to the newspaper Ouest-France, Hinault, who no longer has an official role with the Tour de France organisers ASO since his retirement last year, said the riders should refuse to start when the race begins in the Vendée on 7 July. “The peloton should put its feet to the ground and say, if he is starting the race, we won’t start.”Hinault was known as a spokesman among the riders during his career which lasted from 1975 to 1986, and during his first Tour de France exactly 40 years ago he became celebrated for leading a riders’ strike after the organisers attempted to make them race three stages in a single day.“Christopher Froome should not be at the start of the Tour,” Hinault said. “Quite simply because he has tested positive, for me this is not an abnormal test. As always, people do not take the decision when it should be taken. The people at the UCI should have said, you have been caught, so you should not be racing.”Salbutamol is classified in a different way to other substances in that it is permitted up to a certain threshold – which Froome’s A and B samples exceeded – after which a rider has to explain the result. Until the case is resolved an athlete is permitted to race, although teams who are members of the voluntary Movement for Credible Cycling, which does not include Team Sky, go a step further and impose a ban on its cyclists.There is no indication when Froome’s case will be resolved. The Tour organisers have called for it to be done as soon as possible but the head of the UCI, David Lappartient, has said he fears the outcome will not be known before the start of the Tour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fc8fb8afcd462a7cbae064dded3152b5b24352/231_194_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff33619327f2f8ec14fd3282d5f5b361","title":"royal ascot sir michael stoute poets word","story":"One Ascot legend handed the baton to another here on Wednesday, as Frankie Dettori’s golden run of form came to an abrupt halt and Sir Michael Stoute claimed outright possession of the all-time trainers’ record at the Royal meeting. Poet’s Word, a five-year-old who embodies Stoute’s patient approach, beat the Dettori-ridden favourite Cracksman with ease in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, and his trainer now has his 76th Royal Ascot winner.For the second race running, Cracksman did not produce the form that carried him to a seven-length success in the Champion Stakes over the same mile and a quarter in October. Poet’s Word was the runner-up on that occasion and for all Stoute’s brilliance with maturing horses, it is hard to believe he has improved by 10 lengths since the autumn.Poet’s Word, though, was clearly the best horse on the day, while Dettori did not look happy aboard Cracksman at any stage. The 2-5 favourite was the shortest market leader here since Black Caviar went off at 1-6 for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in 2012, but Dettori was nudging at Cracksman soon after the start and though he got to the front at the top of the straight, James Doyle, on Poet’s Word, had him covered. He was soon in front and kept on well to beat Cracksman by two-and-a-quarter lengths.“Obviously, he is not the same horse that I was riding in the spring,” Dettori said. “He was very lethargic and never travelling at any stage. Usually when he turns for home, the turbo kicks in but today it was very one-paced. It wasn’t his run.”“I make no excuses whatsoever. The other horse had him covered from two out. To my mind, he is just playing around a little bit. To that extent, we will get him home and sharpen him up a little bit.”While Gosden returned to Newmarket to with a puzzle on his hands, Stoute was left to enjoy one of the more significant moments of his long career. As he has pointed out, his late friend and racing rival Sir Henry Cecil compiled his record of 75 Royal Ascot winners at a time when the meeting was staged over four days rather than five.Reaching 76 winners at the season’s most competitive meeting is still a great achievement, however, and Stoute went on to make it 77 when Expert Eye took the concluding Jersey Stakes.“Henry did most of his training when it was four days,” Stoute said, “so I’ve had more cracks at it than he did. Nobody respected him more than I did as a trainer.Stoute’s second success of the day with Expert Eye was also significant for his jockey James McDonald. He was a leading figure in the Australian weighing room and Godolphin’s retained jockey in the southern hemisphere when he was banned for 18 months in 2016 for asking a friend to place a $1,000 bet on his behalf on a horse making its racecourse debut.British fans may well remember McDonald making a name for himself during a busman’s holiday in the summer of 2016 that included a win in the Northumberland Plate Handicap and Group-race successes at both Newmarket’s July meeting and Glorious Goodwood.McDonald is now trying to rebuild his career and has two more significant rides at this week’s meeting: Equilateral, the favourite for the Group One Commonwealth Cup on Friday, and Stoute’s Elector, in the Queen’s colours, in the King Edward VII Stakes the same afternoon.“He felt like a rocket ship out there,” McDonald said. “Credit to the horse and credit to Sir Michael, he’s a true legend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37d9f9e83ba550b2974048ed18ff634f9ec822e/88_3_3890_2334/master/3890.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3223eba51655bc75947ff453278b9a5","title":"stan wawrinka defeat sam querrey queens","story":"• Swiss goes down 7-5, 6-7, 6-1 to 2010 champion• Marin Cilic sees off Gilles Müller 4-6, 6-3, 6-3There was a clear sign on Wednesday that Stan Wawrinka has fully recovered from his persistent knee problems. He lost to Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-7 (3), 6-1, but the troublesome joint was strong enough for Wawrinka to smash his racket over it after a missed forehand that cost him a break of serve.Wawrinka had two lots of surgery on his left knee last year to fix a hole in a cartilage but he came through a two-hour match against Querrey and was back out on Court No\u0026nbsp1 soon after to play a doubles match with Novak Djokovic. It seems he has healed OK, even if the racket has not.Wawrinka, a three-times grand slam champion, has been faltering since he made his first comeback in January. After six months out it has been a slow process but then it was not long ago that he could barely walk.“You can’t rush it,” the Swiss said. He lost in the second round of the Australian Open and the first round of the French. Here he missed seven set points at 5-4 in the first set, and was then broken to 15 himself. Wawrinka levelled the match by winning the tie‑break in a second set that went with serve but was then broken in the fourth and sixth games of the third set – which was when he decided to let his racket have it.Wawrinka said afterwards that he felt his knee finally back moving in the way he wants it to, which it had not been when he was playing in Paris. He also had a warning for Andy Murray, who is making his own comeback.“I think he was, for sure, moving, playing well, knowing that he’s been away for a year. But if I take my experience, what’s important is how he’s going to be the next match he’s going to play, when he’s going to play, how it’s going to feel,” he said.“My first match was Australian Open, and two days after I was not feeling like pain or whatever, but my body was completely off. I lost 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 but I couldn’t really do anything. That’s mentally tough, because you have never experienced that in the past.”Querrey, who lost to Marin Cilic in the semi-final at Wimbledon last year, is seeded No\u0026nbsp5 and will play him again in the quarter-final here after the No\u0026nbsp1 seed beat Gilles Müller 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.On the other side of the draw Frances Tiafoe, a 20-year-old from just outside Washington DC, beat Argentina’s Leonardo Meyer 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals of an ATP event on grass for the first time. Tiafoe’s family emigrated to the US from Sierra Leone in the late 90s and he learned the game because his father had a job as a caretaker at a junior tennis centre. It is one of the more extraordinary stories on tour. He will play his friend Jérémy Chardy, who beat Daniil Medvedev 7-6 (6), 6-3."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bba809e485109c1d4ed0b70f0ac882a14645360/0_0_4882_3255/master/4882.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6860b053f466d467f5a3e9133d737b89 960w","title":"england v south africa womens t20 international live","story":"A coruscating 116 from Tammy Beaumont inspired England to a record-breaking victory over South Africa at Taunton.20th over: South Africa 129-6 (Luus 3, Ismail 1) England complete an almost perfect match, in which they broke two significant records: the highest total in IT20 cricket history and now the highest winning margin by runs. Tammy Beaumont’s coruscating 116 was the highlight but there were so many brilliant performances, including a ridiculous spell of three overs for two runs from Anya Shrubsole at the start of the innings.Another one for Dani Hazell, with Lackay swinging straight to midwicket. Two balls remaining.19th over: South Africa 124-5 (Lackay 2, Luus 1) England made a record score when they batted and now they are on course for a record victory. South Africa need 11 runs from the final over to deny them.Anya Shrubsole ends van Niekerk’s innings with a spectacular swooping catch at mid-off! Van Niekerk made a fine 72 from 51 balls, and probably thought she was moving to 76 when she slapped Katherine Brunt towards mid-off. Shrubsole had other ideas.18th over: South Africa 123-4 (van Niekerk 72, Lackay 2) England’s T20 form has been up and down in recent times but this emphatic victory is a fine way to start the tournament. On this evidence they will surely be facing New Zealand in the final.17th over: South Africa 115-4 (van Niekerk 65, Lackay 0) Jones hurts her back while saving six with brilliant piece of fielding on the square-leg boundary. She’s okay to continue. Gunn’s over – which includes a 37mph over – with consecutive slog-swept sixes from van Niekerk. She has played heroically in the face of certain defeat.Mignon du Preez falls, driving Ecclestone straight to mid-off. England could still pull of a record victory - they need to restrict South Africa to fewer than 135.15th over: South Africa 98-3 (van Niekerk 50, du Preez 24) Dane van Niekerk works Anya Shrubsole for a single to reach a really impressive half-century. It’s strange to praise a captain’s innings when her team are getting stuffed, but she has set an admirable example. Shrubsole ends with the startling figures of 4-2-8-0.14th over: South Africa 92-3 (van Niekerk 46, du Preez 22) Knight saves four with a fine ing stop at mid-off. Both teams are still scrapping as if the match is in the balance, which depending on your perspective is either impressive or slightly weird. I’ll go with the former. 13th over: South Africa 85-3 (van Niekerk 41, du Preez 21) South Africa continue to go down fighting. Van Niekerk wallops Ecclestone over midwicket for four 12th over: South Africa 77-3 (van Niekerk 35, du Preez 20) Jenny Gunn almost takes an astonishing catch! Van Niekerk blasted Hazell down the ground, where Gunn stretched to take a spectacular one-handed catch on the run. She knew her momentum was going to take her over the rope so she threw the ball up in the air, jumped off and then back onto the field of the play – only to drop a simple chance as the ball dropped into her hands. 11th over: South Africa 67-3 (van Niekerk 26, du Preez 19) England are next up for the double-header, with games against South Africa and New Zealand at Taunton on Saturday. The cricket balls in that second game are going to take one hell of a beating.10th over: South Africa 61-3 (van Niekerk 25, du Preez 14) This is an admirable, defiant innings from the captain van Niekerk. Her team have had a miserable day but she is still batting with a lot of pride. She gets another boundary in that over, reverse sweeping Hazell nicely for four.9th over: South Africa 54-3 (van Niekerk 20, du Preez 12) Van Niekerk swipes Nat Sciver for a huge six over midwicket to bring up the fifty. Sciver’s first over goes for 17 – and if South Africa can keep that rate up for last 11 overs… they’ll still lose the game.8th over: South Africa 37-3 (van Niekerk 9, du Preez 6) The clever left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone comes into the attack and is swept firmly for four by Mignon du Preez. Van Niekerk makes it two boundaries in the over with a brusque slap through extra cover.7th over: South Africa 28-3 (van Niekerk 5, du Preez 1) It’s been a day of record-breaking, and England are closing in on another big one: the largest margin of victory (by runs) in an IT20 match is 115 runs. Sophie Ecclestone makes up for her dropped catch with a terrific run out from mid-off. Brits played tip and run and was well short when Ecclestone’s throw broke the stumps.6th over: South Africa 26-2 (Brits 1, van Niekerk 4) The South African captain van Niekerk, who is not exactly a personification of joie de vivre right now, clouts Brunt down the ground for four. Those are the only runs from the over, and this match is over.5th over: South Africa 22-2 (Brits 1, van Niekerk 0) Shrubsole continues to swing the ball sharply back into the right-handed batters. All Brits can really do is survive, and Shrubsole’s figures are now 3-2-2-0. In the context of the day - 638 runs in 65 overs - they are astonishing.4th over: South Africa 22-2 (Brits 1, van Niekerk 0) South Africa need 229 from 16 overs at a required rate oh what’s the point.Dani Hazell strikes! Lizelle Lee smacked her for two fours and a six but Hazell had the last word with a quicker ball that beat Lee’s attempted sweep and trapped her plumb LBW.3rd over: South Africa 8-1 (Lee 5, Brits 1) Brits chips Shrubsole towards cover, where Ecclestone puts down another simple chance. It’s unlikely to cost them the game, but England will still be annoyed at dropping two sitters like that.2nd over: South Africa 6-1 (Lee 4, Brits 0) Lee gets the first boundary, whapping Brunt round the corner for four. Laura Wolvaardt chips Katherine Brunt’s second ball high towards mid-on, where Jenny Gunn drops a simple running catch. She gets an almost identical opportunity two balls later, and this time she takes it. This could get1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Lee 0, Wolvaardt 0) As if a target of 251 wasn’t hard enough for South Africa, Anya Shrubsole is getting some prodigious inswing. It’s as much as Lizelle Lee can do to survive, and the first over of the innings is the most unlikely maiden. Tammy Beaumont speaks! “I had a bit of a minute yesterday with our batting coach with our assistant coach Ali Maiden saying I don’t start quickly enough in T20 cricket, so to get my first hundred is pretty pleasing! It’s always nice to start with Dani Wyatt she starts so quickly that I can play myself in for a bit. We get on really well. It’s an incredible wicket here and I feel a bit sorry for the South African girls having to bowl twice in one day, but we all have that at some stage in this Tri-Series. The standard of women’s cricket is going through the roof.”20th over: England 250-3 (Brunt 42, Knight 1) Heather Knight gets a single off the last ball of the innings to take England to the landmark score of 250. TWO HUNDRED AND BLOODY FIFTY! Poor South Africa have gone for 466 in 40 overs today, and you would expect England to cruise to victory. Dani Wyatt (56 from 36), Nat Sciver (33 from 15) and Katherine Brunt (42* from 16) all batted superbly, but Tammy Beaumont was again the star with a joyous 116 from 52 balls.Sciver goes to the penultimate ball of the innings. It was a unique dismissal - she stepped across to the off side and dragged a leg stump delivery back onto the stumps, before hitting her own wicket to make sure. She played a lovely cameo of 33 from 15 balls.19th over: England 240-2 (Sciver 27, Brunt 39) Sciver lifts Klaas sweetly over extra cover for four, one of the classiest shots of the innings, and ends the over with a mighty slog sweep for six. This is staggering stuff. 18th over: England 224-2 (Sciver 14, Brunt 37) A full toss from Lackay is muscled over long on for six by Brunt, which brings up England’s highest IT20 score. The record by any country is the 216 for one made by New Zealand earlier today – and England have demolished it with 14 balls to spare! I haven’t a clue what’s going off out there. Brunt smashes two more sixes, and would have had a third but for a great bit of fielding from Brits. Twenty five from the over! 17th over: England 199-2 (Sciver 14, Brunt 12) Brunt hits two boundaries off van Niekerk, both with the aid of misfields. South Africa have had a day of almost unprecedented misery: in 37 overs they’ve conceded 415 runs.16th over: England 188-2 (Sciver 13, Brunt 2) The new batter Katherine Brunt slaps a high full toss to mid-off, where Klaas puts down a tricky running chance.Beaumont pulls Lackay for four, dissecting the two boundary fielders perfectly. Her placement has been immaculate, and her timing has been vaguely adequate too: she walks down the track to belt the next ball over midwicket for six. But she’s gone now! She toe-ends a moon ball straight back to Lackay, who takes a simple catch.Beaumont is congratulated by the South African players and walks off with a huge smile. That was an astonishing innings: 116 from 52 balls with 18 fours and four sixes. She scored 108 from her last 40 balls. 15th over: England 175-1 (Beaumont 106, Sciver 12) If Beaumont bats 20 overs she will obliterate the record for the highest score in an IT20 match, Meg Lanning’s 126 against Ireland in 2014. One of the best things about watching Beaumont is the sheer sense of fun she reminds us what the word ‘sport’ used to mean. At the other end, Sciver gets moving with consecutive edges for four.“Re the need to do something to help bowlers (12th over), how about Duke and Kookaburra producing pre-scuffed balls?” says Smylers. “Bowling improves when the ball’s surface is altered, but it’s against the rules for players to perform significant alterations while playing — so why not simply issue them with balls that are good for bowling with? Each new ball comes with one shiny side and one rough one.”I’m not sure about that – partly because I think would alter the balance too much, but also because it’s slightly dangerous territory. I don’t think it needs too much adjustment. Don’t forget it’s only a year since we had some thrilling low-scoring games in the Champions Trophy. I think they should prepare the flattest pitches imaginable until England have won the Men’s World Cup next year, and then worry about fairness.14th over: England 159-1 (Beaumont 101, Sciver 1) Nat Sciver is promoted up the order to No3. Beaumont, meanwhile, moves to 97 with a mighty six over wide long-on that almost cleans up the Sky Sports commentary team in their little pod beside the boundary. A precise sweep for four brings up a stunning century, her third in consecutive innings for England. It’s taken only 47 balls, the second fastest in IT20 history. I’m not sure it’s possible to bat much better than she has today.Glory be, a wicket! Wyatt slog sweeps Lackay towards cow corner, where Ismail takes a calm catch. Wyatt played beautifully to make 56 from 36 balls.13th over: England 147-0 (Wyatt 56, Beaumont 90) Beaumont dumps a full toss from van Niekerk for six before being dropped at long-on by Luus, though that’s a harsh description for what was essentially a brilliant bit of fielding. Luus took a stunning one-handed catch but had to release the ball because she was about to fall over the rope. She did, at least, save the six.12th over: England 136-0 (Wyatt 55, Beaumont 80) Stacy Lackay is the latest to draw the short straw, and Wyatt works a single to bring up her fifty from 31 balls. She’s been overshadowed by Beaumont but it’s been a cracking innings. She’s been particularly good through and over extra cover, a point that is reinforced with another storming hit over the top for four. England need 81 from the last eight overs for the world record.“Forgive me if I’m being stupid,” says Greg John, “but with all this talk of cricket being overbalanced in favour of bat over ball, shouldn’t we just get rid of fielding restrictions?”I don’t if that would work, but I think they probably need to do something.11th over: England 127-0 (Wyatt 47, Beaumont 80) Beaumont completes her wagon wheel by ramping Klaas for four, and follows up with a slog-sweep to the boundary next ball. I can’t keep up with this. Beaumont has scored 71 from her last 24 deliveries! Even a mishit reverse ramp into her own grille can’t wipe that familiar smile from her face. 10th over: England 116-0 (Wyatt 45, Beaumont 71) The legspinner Sune Luus comes into the attack, and England set about hitting her out of the attack. Wyatt makes room to blitz the second ball over extra cover for four and then Beaumont clouts a full toss back over the bowler’s head for four. That’s the 22nd four of this innings – and Beaumont ends the over with the first six, the sweetest of straight hits from a flighted legbreak. Is this even cricket we’re watching anymore? I don’t know what it is but I love it. 9th over: England 100-0 (Wyatt 40, Beaumont 60) Beaumont charges van Niekerk and lifts another jaunty boundary down the ground. A single brings up the century partnership from an absurd 8.5 overs.“Evening Rob,” says Guy Hornsby. “I know yesterday was all sorts of ridiculous, (and part of me wishes I could’ve moved to Australia for 24 hours for the fun) but our women’s team is just as impressive, and destructive. We’ve got a pairing that’ll make Roy and YJB sit up from their isotonic drinks here.”Beaumont in particular is fantastic, almost the complete batter. She could become the best in the world in the next 2-3 years. Mind you, there are a few people you can say that about in this golden age of batting.8th over: England 92-0 (Wyatt 38, Beaumont 54) The young offspinner Raisibi Ntozakhe assumes the position. Beaumont skids back in her crease to pull heartily for four. The IT20 record of 216 for one, posted by New Zealand earlier today, will be under threat if these two carry on much longer. A beautiful shot from Beaumont, clipped wristily through midwicket on the run, takes her to 49, and a single brings up a majestic fifty from 27 balls – the fastest by an England player in IT20s, for the next few minutes at least. 7th over: England 78-0 (Wyatt 37, Beaumont 41) The captain Dane van Niekerk comes on to bowl some spin. After a boundary drought of four deliveries, Wyatt clouts a slog sweep to cow corner. Nine from the over. Wyatt has 37 from 19 balls, Beaumont 41 from 23. They complement each other beautifully.6th over: England 69-0 (Wyatt 31, Beaumont 38) Wyatt blasts Ismail high towards long on, where Klaas misjudges what would have been a very difficult catch even if she’d been able to lay hands on it. Which she didn’t. Beaumont then hits three consecutive boundaries, which makes it seven fours from her last eight deliveries!If you include the New Zealand game earlier today, South Africa have conceded 285 for one in 26 overs. Asking them to bowl to the New Zealand and England batting line-ups on a Taunton belter on the same day is surely a human rights violation.“I have nothing witty to say,” says Greg John, “but I’m with you.”Wit, as experienced OBO-dwellers will tell you, is not compulsory round here.5th over: England 53-0 (Wyatt 28, Beaumont 25) Masabata Klaas comes into the attack, although with the way this innings is going it should probably be called the defence. Beaumont charges down the track, turning an attempted yorker into a low full toss and dumping it whence it came for four. She stays in her crease next ball but the result is the same, a perky clump down the ground for four. A sizzling slog-sweep and a clip through midwicket makes it four consecutive boundaries – and a fifty partnership in 4.5 overs. This is blistering stuff.4th over: England 37-0 (Wyatt 28, Beaumont 9) Wyatt rides a short ball from Ismail, uppercutting for four with both feet off the ground, and drags another boundary just over the head of mid-on. She has 28 from 13 balls and is largely responsible for a terrific start by England. Anyone out there? Eh?3rd over: England 27-0 (Wyatt 19, Beaumont 8) Wyatt hits Kapp’s first two balls for four, with an uppercut followed by an emphatic thump between extra cover and mid-off. She dances down the track two balls later to ping another boundary through extra cover. Wyatt is off to her usual flyer: 19 not out from eight balls.2nd over: England 14-0 (Wyatt 6, Beaumont 8) The brilliant Shabnim Ismail will share the new ball. The first ball pops from a length and is steered deftly through the vacant slip area for four by Beaumont, who comes into this match after back-to-back ODI centuries. A slightly unbecoming hack to leg brings two more, and then she survives a huge LBW appeal after playing around sharp inducker. That looked really close, though replays showed it was bouncing over leg stump. Six from an excellent Ismail over. 1st over: England 8-0 (Wyatt 6, Beaumont 2) Peep peep! Marizanne Kapp bowls the first over. England are opening with Dani Wyatt, who is so dangerous in this format and has blasted two centuries in the last six games IT20s. She gets going with a push into the covers that sneaks through for four. A few quick singles complete a good start for England.When you win a World Cup, it gives you a serious taste for more. I say this confidently even though I’ve never won a World Cup - not even on Brian Lara Cricket ’96, with a cheat code that allowed me All-Time World XI of Bradman, Sobers et al to face the UAE in every round. But everybody knows that glory is addictive and in November, England will hope to complete their domination of the white-ball world by winning the World T20 in the Caribbean.The build-up to that tournament starts with this Vitality IT20 Tri-Series involving New Zealand and South Africa. There’s an interesting format, with each team playing a double-header on different days: South Africa at Taunton today, England on the same ground on Saturday, and New Zealand at Bristol a week tomorrow. Each team plays four group games, with the top two going through to the final at Chelmsford.New Zealand won the first match of the tournament, beating South Africa by 66 runs earlier this afternoon. They continued their preposterous recent batting form, posting a record score of 216 for one from their 20 overs. Suzie Bates crashed 124 for 66 balls and Sophie Devine made 73 from 48. Amelia Kerr didn’t even get a bat.It means that South Africa are under severe pressure on day one of the competition, as defeat tonight would leave them struggling to make the final. The match starts at 5.40pm, and we’ll have the toss soon.

The commission is proposing a series of measures to counter behavioural manipulation and fake news, including an obligation on internet platforms to demand greater transparency from those who use them to micro-target messages at iniduals.Currently the social media tools, King said, “can easily be hijacked by malicious actors – both state and non-state – to subvert our democratic systems and use them as a weapon against us”.King told an audience in Brussels: “What once might have been dismissed as fantasy has rapidly entered the world of fact with everything from a referendum on an EU agreement with Ukraine, through a referendum on EU membership to a presidential election apparently being fair game.”The EU’s member states are soon to publish their plans to tackle the hacking of electoral systems and attempts to obtain voter data.However, the commission is seeking to win round member states’ efforts to tackle a “much more subtle and pernicious” attempt to undermine democracies, through the use of social media as a “weapon of mass disinformation – a WMD for the modern age”.King said: “In my view, this can take three forms: hacks and leaks designed to change public opinion by revealing damaging information at a crucial point during a campaign the use of fake news to sway public opinion and influence results and the misuse of targeted messaging based on psychometrics derived from mined user personality trait data – or Cambridge Analytica for short.”King said he wanted agreement “in the coming weeks” on a code of practice to ensure internet users were informed as to why certain messages or stories were being fed to them via Facebook or Twitter. The identity of those behind sponsored content should also be clearer.“Users should know who has created the content they are seeing, who might gain from it, and why it is being shown to them,” he said.The EU’s monitoring had catalogued “over 4,000 examples of disinformation, including for example 31 disinformation narratives around the chemical attack in Salisbury and 57 around the downing of flight MH17”, King added.“Thanks to this, we now have a better idea of the main tools, channels and messages of the Kremlin’s disinformation campaign,” he said.

The Council of Europe details a history of extreme persecution including enslavement, forced sterilisation, separation from children and massacres.Roma have Indian roots, and migrated slowly westwards over hundreds of years, appearing in historical records from Europe by the 14th century. Originally nomadic, though now settled in many areas, they were first targeted by European officials over 500 years ago.“Roma were banned from the Holy Roman Empire in 1501 and, as of this date, could be caught and killed by any citizen,” the Council of Europe explains. In France less than two centuries later, Louis XIV ordered that all Gypsy men be condemned to forced labour for life without trial, women be sterilised and children be sent to poorhouses.As the Enlightenment spread across Europe in the 18th century, Roma were among the many excluded. Spain in 1749 launched an operation known as the “great Gypsy round-up” Roma were enslaved in parts of what is now Romania until 1856. The Austro-Hungarian empire ran a fierce “assimilation” policy that involved separating children and parents, the Council of Europe explains.Roma were among the targets of Nazi laws introduced in the 1930s, and Italy’s own fascist ethnic cleansing rules of the 1920s, and during the second world war hundreds of thousands were killed in massacres and at concentration camps.In the immediate aftermath of the war, many Roma concentration camp survivors were refused help and compensation. In the decades that followed, stigmatisation and discrimination has continued across much of Europe.As late as the 1970s, Switzerland was taking children from their parents, arguing that they couldn’t educate them to be good citizens. A recent study in Britain found a huge rise in Romany and Traveller families having their children taken away, a trend blamed on institutional prejudice. This decade alone they have been segregated in schools in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia and databases or other surveys such as the one proposed in Italy are not unprecedented in other parts of Europe.Last year a Swedish appeals court ruled that police should pay compensation after setting up an illegal database of Roma family trees that included several thousand people, many of them children, or iniduals without any criminal record."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/761c7a25729fc8279e7c83b6882c568cc4aa1067/0_137_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dcdb67ecf4f6b6467dc7e6f6dcf481","title":"panama papers firm mossack fonseca did not know who 75 of its clients were","story":"Mossack Fonseca made frantic efforts to discover its own clients’ identities as it fell under global scrutinyThe offshore firm at the heart of the Panama Papers leak did not know who as many as three-quarters of its clients were at the time of the exposé, according to an investigation.The Panamanian company Mossack Fonseca made frantic efforts to discover its clients’ identities in the spring of 2016 as it fell under global scrutiny.The Panama Papers are a leak of 11.5m files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by\u0026nbspthe German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with\u0026nbspa network of international partners, including the , in April 2016.The documents show the myriad ways in which the rich exploit secretive offshore tax regimes. Twelve national leaders were among 143 politicians, their families and close associates shown to have been using offshore tax havens. They included the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif the former vice-president of Iraq, Ayad Allawi the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko and the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson.An offshore investment fund run by the father of the then British prime minister David Cameron\u0026nbspavoided paying tax in Britain by hiring residents of the Bahamas to sign its paperwork.The leak is larger than the\u0026nbspUS diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2010, and the\u0026nbspsecret intelligence documents given to journalists by Edward Snowden in 2013.One client of the company also complained that the stories generated by the Panama Papers meant his customers would have to pay taxes.The revelations will harden the resolve of anti-corruption campaigners who have argued the offshore sector needs to become more transparent.Last month, they secured a major victory in the UK when MPs passed a law requiring British overseas territories, including the BVI, to create public registers of shell company owners.The extent of the firm’s record-keeping failures is revealed in a fresh leak of data from the company, which declared in March that it had gone out of business and was shutting down.The new material was obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).The new leak suggests Mossack Fonseca drafted reports for law enforcement concerning at least a dozen of its own clients following the Panama Papers, in some instances citing articles by journalists as supporting evidence.The firm also received a flurry of requests for information from law enforcement agencies, including the UK’s Serious Fraud Office.In one such instance, the firm did not know who owned an offshore company of interest, even though Mossack Fonseca staff were serving as the company’s nominee directors.Other instances of unusual practice appear to have continued despite exposure by reporters. According to records held by the ICIJ, one Mossack Fonseca employee was continuing to sign documents and attend the board meetings of several thousand offshore companies, despite having died in 2005.Amid pressure from regulators and law enforcement agencies, the firm also faced complaints from enraged clients. “Thanks to you, all the names of our customers have been known by the authorities of their countries,” wrote one. “Thanks to Mossack, customers have to pay income taxes.”At the time of the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca said: “We are responsible members of the global financial and business community” and denied any wrongdoing.Neither Jürgen Mossack nor Ramón Fonseca, the firm’s founders, responded to requests for comment from the ICIJ concerning the new leak.The Panama Papers brought a new level of public scrutiny to the role of offshore tax havens in tax fraud, money laundering and financial secrecy. The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan were forced to leave office as a result of separate scandals, and legislatures around the world passed new laws to tackle offshore crime following an international summit on tackling corruption hosted by the UK. German police are understood to have obtained a copy of the original Panama Papers data and shared it with several other countries to assist with criminal investigations. Last year the British government told parliament that four arrests had been made as part of 66 investigations into suspected tax evasion, and that three arrests had been made in relation to a suspected organised crime group.Several countries are understood to have raised millions in additional tax revenue thanks to the disclosures. HMRC’s chief executive officer told a parliamentary committee that it was expected the disclosures would bring in an extra £100m of revenue, while Germany was reported to have raised €140m (£123m) using the information.Despite the move to introduce transparency by the UK parliament last month, several of Britain’s overseas territories have refused to implement new legislation. The BVI has hired a law firm to explore a possible legal challenge against the transparency measure on constitutional grounds. The premier of the Cayman Islands, another British tax haven affected by the measure, attacked the vote as “reminiscent of the worst injustices of a bygone era of colonial despotism”.It was January 2017, and one fund manager had evidently had enough of Mossack Fonseca. Despite having been a client of the firm for years, he had just been informed that further to due diligence checks, the offshore services firm would be resigning as registered agent of his offshore company.“Thank you for your email,” began his response. “It is true that thanks to you (Panama Papers) in March 2016, all the names of our customers have been known by the authorities of their countries.”“Thanks to Mossack, customers have to pay income taxes.”The unusually frank complaint appears in the fresh leak of documents from the now redundant offshore firm, which became synonymous with offshore tax evasion and money laundering after its files were exposed in the Panama Papers two years ago. The original leak of the firm’s data, encompassing almost four decades of documents, emails and more, revealed for the first time the offshore financial interests of world leaders, celebrities and criminals, and prompted a firestorm of public debate about the ability of ultra-wealthy elites to effectively purchase exemptions from the tax laws that govern the majority of the world’s citizenry.Research by the ICIJ and its partners depicts a firm under scrutiny from law enforcement, regulators and politicians in Panama and around the world.A number of clients reported that banks had begun blocking transfers of funds to and from entities with “Mossack Fonseca” in their name in response to the scandal, the new material shows.Amid a desperate attempt to bring its compliance policies up to scratch while surviving the increased regulatory scrutiny, Mossack Fonseca also faced an onslaught of enraged and even abusive complaints from bankers and lawyers having to explain to their own clients why details of their offshore arrangements were appearing in newspaper articles.“I demand an explanation why your firm is so impossible to work with! In any properly regulated jurisdiction, a firm like yours would have been shut by the regulator!!! ... ” wrote one employee of a European financial firm.Mossack Fonseca seems to have aggravated some customers by continuing to charge its standard rates during the crisis, including fees for those who wanted to close down companies. “WHAT A BRUTALITY !!!! that you dare to send me an invoice for ‘the annual fee’,” wrote one client, corresponding directly with the firm.Internal document management also appears to have become more chaotic in the wake of the leak, resulting in Mossack Fonseca requesting information it already held or filing multiple incomplete requests. “We look like fucking amateurs,” wrote one customer after the firm asked it to obtain more information from its client. “A Mickey-Mouse operation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb5156641f1d143e37880552a6a817f21232577/0_109_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b80b6b054d3db185933d0a4e63bdd80","title":"top catalan chef joan roca defends decision to host spanish king","story":"Roca dismisses suggestion he is taking sides in Catalan independence rowThe celebrated Catalan chef Joan Roca has dismissed suggestions that he is taking sides in the bitter battle over Catalonia’s independence by hiring out one of his venues for a prize-giving ceremony attended by King Felipe.Roca, whose three-Michelin starred restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca, has twice been named the best in the world, says he is being unfairly criticised for agreeing to host the Spanish monarch, who angered many Catalans by refusing to denounce the police violence that met last year’s illegal independence referendum.The Princess of Girona Foundation awards, which promote young people’s professional and personal development, were due to be given out at a ceremony held at Girona’s auditorium on 28 June.But after the city council said the venue was unavailable because of building works, the event was transferred to Roca’s Espai Mas Marroch, a 15th-century country house on the outskirts of Girona.News that one of Catalonia’s most lauded chefs was hosting the king did not go down well with some pro-independence campaigners.Lluc Salellas, a city councillor for the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy (Cup), published an open letter to Roca and his two brothers, urging them not to host the event.“Rethink allowing Felipe of Bourbon, who justified the violence against thousands of Catalans - including hundreds of people from Girona - into your house, the Mas Marroch, to preach his words in our region,” said the letter.Roca responded to his critics on Wednesday, telling them the decision had nothing to do with politics and had been taken only because the auditorium was not available.“We’re hurt,” he told the Catalan radio station RAC1. “What’s happening seems unfair to us. The only thing we want to say is that we do not have to do politics. We’re cooks. A restaurant is about hospitality. We do our job.”However, Salellas accused the Rocas of being disingenuous.“The Roca brothers have a standing and a public reach that means they can receive thanks and congratulations,” he told RAC1. “But it also means they can receive criticism from those who don’t agree with their decision. They’re taking sides: by accepting the king’s attendance, they’re making a decision. That’s legitimate and respectable and we’re not questioning it. But I don’t think it’s right to suggest this isn’t a political gesture.”Carles Puigdemont, who was sacked as Catalan president by the Spanish government for staging the referendum and unilaterally declaring independence last October, was born in Girona province. The deposed premier also served as mayor of Girona city.A spokesman for the city council said the auditorium and another venue were scheduled to undergo works at the time of the awards ceremony.But he said the mayor, Marta Madrenas, who is a member of Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia party, opposed the foundation’s use of the auditorium in any case.“The mayor has suggested that the auditorium’s management should not host the foundation’s prizes in future years,” he said. “The reason is the speech the king gave on 3 October, for which Girona city council declared him persona non grata by a wide majority.”The local council in the nearby municipality of Caldes de Malavella said it would protest against the king’s visit by naming a square to commemorate the holding of the independence referendum.In a statement, it said: “The king is not welcome in Caldes de Malavella. The municipality has not forgotten the angry speech he made on 3 October, with its absolute silence over the victims of the brutal police repression that saw peaceful citizens in Catalonia beaten and attacked on 1 October.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3537155.1529476874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"patience with britain wearing out over border solution hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Hogan: ‘I have never seen such solidarity in the Commission on any issue, as I have seen in relation to the problems that this can create for Ireland.’ File photograph: David SleatorThe Patience with the British Government is “wearing out” in Brussels over delays proposing solutions for how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, European Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan has said. The British Government do not have a “coherent position” on what kind of Brexit deal they want, which has posed problems for EU negotiators, Mr Hogan told journalists in Brussels on Tuesday. The comments come ahead of a key European Council summit of EU leaders next week. An initial deadline for the British government to make progress on how the Border “backstop” commitment would be achieved in time for the summit, is anticipated to be missed. The backstop was a commitment given last December, that if there was no deal reached on how to avoid a hard border, there would be no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney have said the backstop agreement would need to be “legally operable.”“If the United Kingdom continues the way they have been over the last number of months, without coming forward with proposals as promised, well then you’re facing the difficult situation of a no-deal,” Mr Hogan said. October is the deadline to agree an overall Brexit deal, as the European Parliament will need time to approve it. “We’re waiting for a long time for the United Kingdom to tell us precisely what they want out of these negotiations. . . They need to do so sooner rather than later, as time is getting short, and patience is wearing out,” Mr Hogan said.There was a “good understanding” of the political problems UK prime minister Theresa May faces within her party, in trying to agree what relationship Britain will have with the EU after they leave, he said. Mr Hogan said Ireland had achieved a “strong” position in the Brexit negotiations, aligning the other 26 Member States in making avoiding a hard border a necessity. “I have never seen such solidarity in the Commission on any issue, as I have seen in relation to the problems that this can create for Ireland,” he said. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said his party would be “disappointed” if the Irish Government failed to secure progress on the Border backstop at the June summit. “In an 11th hour negotiation, pressure would come on the Irish Government to accept a political statement”, rather than a legal text, he said. A political commitment to avoid a hard border would hold “zero value,” and would be a “major win” for British negotiators, Mr Carthy said.Charles Tannock, a pro-remain Conservative Party MEP, said the final Brexit agreement on the Border would have to be “watertight.” Mr Tannock warned there was a danger if the agreement was unpalatable to hard Brexiteers, some of “the crazies” in the Conservative Party would seek to remove Ms May and “tear up” the commitments after Brexit. Some quarters of the Conservative Party held the view Ireland was still akin to a “vassal state” that should follow the will of Britain, he told a media briefing of Irish journalists.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"queen knights garter hundreds line streets windsor greet royals","story":"Hundreds have watched the spectacle of the Queen and Knights of the Garter attending the Garter service at the chapel where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex marriedComment: Why we must recognise the real health risks of compulsive video gaming Fears for Yemen civilians as battle to retake Hodeidah reaches residential areas around port Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s daughter killed herself two days after leaving psychiatric unit City water feature was bricked over to stop people glued to their phones from falling inDoctor who left date paralysed in car crash kept his job after he used medical knowledge to try help her walk againComment: After all that fuss from Dominic Grieve, the big bad Brexit rebel has bottled itDonald Trump signs executive order to end child separation policyCalls for racism investigation after claims nightclub charged black people twice as much for entryBenetton ad featuring migrants being rescued at sea criticised as \u0026#39squalid\u0026#39 by Italy\u0026#39s hard-right interior minister Comment: The Gosport scandal was a twisted parody of how old people should be cared forEngland fans cause outrage singing about Hitler in World Cup city once invaded by NazisNew private Vatican tour lets visitors unlock the Sistine Chapel at dawn and explore before crowds arriveBringing home the Benin Bronzes: Nigeria open to loans rather than a permanent return Comment: The hounding of former servicemen for Troubles-related actions is a national shameStonehenge builders used Pythagoras\u0026#39 theorem 2,000 years before Greek philosopher was born, say experts Hungary passes \u0026#39Stop Soros\u0026#39 law making it a crime to help migrantsSocial media \u0026#39wizardry\u0026#39 will help British troops win warsGosport hospital: GP oversaw \u0026#39practice of shortening lives\u0026#39 that killed 456 patients as report urges police to actWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000164862843_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLZ1bJd-I99VgiaPxe-UMcC6-Lp4metz6QMdj34ESPoA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bringing home benin bronzes nigeria open loans rather permanent","story":"digitalservices@telegraphA brass plaque from Benin\u0026#39s royal palace, now held by a museum in BerlinNigeria could accept the temporary loan of a collection of exquisite bronze sculptures rather than their permanent return by European institutions, including the British Museum, officials have said.The prospect of a loan, rather than full restitution, could set a precedent for other disputed art and artefacts that were taken during the colonial era, from Greece’s Elgin Marbles to Ethiopia’s Magdala treasures.The Benin Bronzes are a collection of intricately-worked sculptures and plaques in bronze, ivory, ceramic and wood that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, which was subsequently incorporated into British-ruled Nigeria.Benin was one of the most powerful kingdoms in West Africa, flourishing in the Middle Ages before it was weakened by succession struggles and civil wars.It also leant its name to the modern-day nation of Benin, which borders Nigeria.The Benin Bronzes were plundered from the kingdom by British forces in 1897 during a punitive expedition.They ended up in museums and galleries in Britain, including the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, as well as Germany, Austria and the US.Nigeria has sought their return since independence from Britain in 1960.Godwin Obaseki, the governor of the southern Nigerian state of Edo where Benin City is now located, said that museum officials in Europe have floated the idea of returning the objects on loan.Whatever terms we can agree to have them back so that we can relate to our experience, relate to these works that are at the essence of who we are, we would be open to such conversations, Mr Obaseki told Reuters.The loan of the Benin Bronzes back to Nigeria could provide a template for the resolution of other disputes such as the one between Britain and Greece over the Elgin or Parthenon MarblesIn some cases it could be a permanent loan and in some cases it (could) just be for temporary display. In other cases it could be a return of works, he said.Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments said its officials had held talks with representatives of European museums and it was “not adverse” to the loan of artefacts.As part of any deal, a legal framework would have to be drawn up to guarantee the artefacts immunity from seizure once flown to Nigeria.Other countries, including Ethiopia and Greece, have rejected the idea of loans, instead demanding permanent returns on the basis that they should not have to borrow their own pilfered property.The British Museum, which lent one of the Elgin Marbles in its collection to St Petersburg\u0027s State Hermitage Museum in 2014, told Reuters it had not received a formal request for any loans from Nigeria\u0027s government.Retired hospital consultant Mark Walker (R) holding two bronze artefacts he returned to the kingdom of Benin in 2014. His grandfather was involved in the 1897 British raid in which they were taken.But we are open to consider any specific proposals when they are made and we remain in dialogue with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, it said in a statement.The current king of Benin has already identified a site for a new museum to accommodate the collection, close to his palace.There is an ongoing dialogue between the palace of the Oba of Benin and some renowned museums in the world, said Frank Irabor, secretary of the Benin Traditional Council.The Benin Bronzes depict scenes from court life involving kings, warriors and royal officials.Some also feature European adventurers and traders, distinguishable by their long hair, weapons and clothing.“While belonging to well-established West African tradition of royal palace decoration, the Benin brass plaques represent a distinct and unique corpus of work, unparalleled elsewhere on the continent,” the British Museum says of the large number of objects in its possession.Eric Ogbemudia, 62, an expert in metal sculpture, said the bronzes should be returned.We will be happy if those stolen artefacts are brought back to Benin. But they stole them. Those items are the works of our forefathers and they are very unique to us, he said.Please review our commenting policyComment: Why we must recognise the real health risks of compulsive video gaming Fears for Yemen civilians as battle to retake Hodeidah reaches residential areas around port Cecil Parkinson\u0026#39s daughter killed herself two days after leaving psychiatric unit City water feature was bricked over to stop people glued to their phones from falling inDoctor who left date paralysed in car crash kept his job after he used medical knowledge to try help her walk againComment: After all that fuss from Dominic Grieve, the big bad Brexit rebel has bottled itDonald Trump signs executive order to end child separation policyCalls for racism investigation after claims nightclub charged black people twice as much for entryBenetton ad featuring migrants being rescued at sea criticised as \u0026#39squalid\u0026#39 by Italy\u0026#39s hard-right interior minister Comment: The Gosport scandal was a twisted parody of how old people should be cared forEngland fans cause outrage singing about Hitler in World Cup city once invaded by NazisNew private Vatican tour lets visitors unlock the Sistine Chapel at dawn and explore before crowds arriveComment: The hounding of former servicemen for Troubles-related actions is a national shameStonehenge builders used Pythagoras\u0026#39 theorem 2,000 years before Greek philosopher was born, say experts Hungary passes \u0026#39Stop Soros\u0026#39 law making it a crime to help migrantsSocial media \u0026#39wizardry\u0026#39 will help British troops win warsGosport hospital: GP oversaw \u0026#39practice of shortening lives\u0026#39 that killed 456 patients as report urges police to actBritish engineer was so angry about Manchester terror attack he travelled to Syria to fight Isil, inquest hears We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000164332069_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"haughty insecure insist addressed titles","story":"digitalservices@telegraphEmmanuel Macron upbraided a child who called him \u0026#39Manu\u0026#39Unlike in America, we rightly see it as pompous or uncool to stand on ceremony Before you read on, I want you to know that yours truly holds a PhD in history.

Though it is very difficult to imagine what a future alien race might do, it is likely they will search out ways of harnessing renewable energy, such as building power plants around stars – those structures, known as Dyson spheres, have never been seen but are the object of keen astrophysical investigation.But the new paper makes clear that could only work for so long, and would become impossible once the universe filled with dark energy and the stars were too far apart. That would force them to reach out, grabbing stars before they become inaccessible.Given the inevitability of the encroaching horizon, any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible, the paper reads.To make sure they didn\u0027t get lost, the civilisations would be able to move the stars closer to their home – with the hope that they would eventually become stuck in their own orbit, and would not stray too far away to become useful.Having worked out what such activity might look like, the paper then aims to look at how we might be able to see if that activity is happening already. If it were, we would be able to look for stars that seem to be moving in an unexpected way, or to spot holes in galaxies where a star might normally be expected.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

This was a matter of procedure, not discrimination.“King’s College is a rich and erse community, and take the wellbeing of its students and staff extremely seriously. We remain committed to being an inclusive and welcoming environment in which to work and study. We categorically deny that the incident referred to was in any way racist.”A spokesperson for King\u0027s College said it had completed its investigation and cleared its porters.\u0026nbsp“Michael Proctor, who is the Provost of King’s College, did speak to Dr Gopal. However, the account of the incident from her perspective was taken from the witness testimony from her Twitter, they said.Cambridge and Oxford have come under criticism for the small number of black students which are\u0026nbspadmitted each year.Last month, it was revealed more than one in four of Oxford’s colleges failed to admit a single black British student each year between 2015 and 2017.Figures revealed several of the most prestigious colleges – including Balliol, University and Magdalen – each admitted two black British students as undergraduates during the three-year period.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

More schools should\u0026nbspfollow their lead\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineMatt Hancock, the culture secretary, has called on more headteachers to ban phonesStudents should not be allowed their mobile phones during school hours, the culture secretary has said.Matt Hancock suggested more headteachers should confiscate mobile phones from children at the start of the day, as he warned\u0026nbspmobiles can have a “real impact” on students’ achievements.The minister is concerned social media use can expose children to “risks” – including cyberbullying.Writing in the Daily , Mr Hancock questioned why young children needed phones at school in the first place.He said: “There are a number of schools across the country that simply don’t allow them.“I believe that very young children don’t need to have access to social media. They are children after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first.”Schools already have the freedom to ban or curb the use of mobile phones during the school day – and Mr Hancock said there was evidence to suggest banning phones in schools worked.“While it is up to inidual schools to decide rather than government, I admire headteachers who do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day. I encourage more schools to follow their lead,” he said.His comments come as a group of Tory MPs have urged for a ban on mobiles during the school day, saying there is evidence it can have “a beneficial effect on pupils’ ability to learn”.In a letter to the , the seven politicians cited a 2015 study by the London School of Economics, writing: “Where schools banned smartphones from the premises, or required them to be handed in at the start of the day, pupils’ chances of getting five good GCSEs increased by an average of two per cent.“The improvement was even more marked for lower-achieving pupils.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles. He practises both the Mona Lisa – slight, closed-lip – and a wide, toothy smile.At least, he’s supposed to do his exercises every day. Being 13, he sometimes forgets, though he understands their importance.“I need to stretch my cheeks,” he says. “I do it for a couple minutes. I have to do it every single day.” He exercises so much that his jaw sometimes hurts. \u0026nbspDavid and Victoria Beckham smile in \u0027amazing\u0027 family night picture How to get white teeth: Four top tips to achieve a brighter smileMan smiles before lethal injection for murder of two young daughtersKevin was born in New Jersey with a rare malignant vascular tumour, a kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, covering the left side of his face, squeezing shut his left eye and pushing his nose to the right. Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

noted that there is nothing in the new document which indicates that the Vatican is, as yet, willing to entertain changes in church policy on LGBT issues.“The furthest they have gone is to indicate a willingness to work towards being ‘a community open and welcoming towards all’.“This pastoral approach is important, but the church’s outreach cannot end there.”The document, known as an instrumentum laboris, was released ahead of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, due to take place in October to discuss young people.The report acknowledged the church’s traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, were “unpopular” among younger generations.It also conceded the question of sexuality within the Catholic world needed to be discussed “more openly and without prejudice.”“The Synod’s primary aim is to make the whole church aware of her important and not at all optional task of accompanying every young person, without exclusion, towards the joy of love,” Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri\u0026nbspsaid at a press conference to introduce the document on Tuesday.Pope Francis gives life advice: in pictures110 Pope Francis\u0027 guide to happinessPope Francis: \u0027Live and let

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky.

reaction.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warned today there is a low risk  that the mould could make a child unwell or cause a reaction.Mould can cause respiratory problems and trigger potentially deadly asthma attacks.The agency has recalled all affected batches as a precaution, but is not aware of any cases where a child has become unwell.A small number of batches from eight products are being recalled, no other cough syrups are affected.Dr Sam Atkinson of the MHRA said: Check if you have any of the listed cough syrups and if you do, please don’t use them.Take them back to where you bought them from.The mould is not always visible, so return any of the affected cough syrup bottles, even if it looks okay to use.If your child has recently taken one of these cough syrups, and, in the unlikely event that they have become unwell or had a reaction, please speak to your GP, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.Our highest priority is making sure the medicines you and your family take are safe.This is why, even though there is a low risk of a reaction, we have asked the company to carry out this recall and why we want people to check their medicine cabinets.Bell’s Healthcare Childrens Dry Cough Glycerin 0.75g/5ml Syrup, batch number:Morrisons Children’s Dry Tickly Cough Glycerin 0.75g/5ml Oral Solution, batch number:Numark

people ill.Inhaling or touching mould spores may cause allergic reactions like sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and rashes, according to the NHS.Moulds can also trigger deadly asthma attacks.Some people are more sensitive to mould than others, including babies and children, elderly people, people with existing skin problems like eczema, those with respiratory problems like asthma and allergies and those with weakened immune systems.Colette Harris, Asthma UK’s Deputy Director of Digital Health, said: Coming into contact with mould can be a huge problem for the 1.1 million children with asthma in the UK, as it can cause allergic reactions, trigger asthma symptoms and in some cases, lead to a potentially life-threatening asthma attack.We would advise any parents who are concerned about their child’s medication to return it to where they bought it from.It is vital that parents of children with asthma who are allergic to mould avoid it where possible, especially as some babies and children are more likely to be affected by mould than adults.Parents should also look after their child’s asthma by making sure they are taking their preventer medicine as prescribed.If you have an affected batch you should stop using it and return the bottle to the shop you bought it

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters.

Labour\u0027s Holly Lynch is also pregnant.Ms Swinson voted despite her baby already being overdue.After the vote, Ms Swinson tweeted: This all happened because the government, fearing a defeat that would have plunged Mrs May\u0027s premiership into a serious crisis, suspended pairing, the arrangement between the parties to accommodate sick MPs and those away on parliamentary business.The government also took exceptional measures to maximise its own vote.Sky News was told of plans to delay the 90-minute debate on the Lords amendments by an hour to allow a Tory MP to undergo an important medical procedure before dashing back to vote.The plan was to make a government statement, taking up about an hour.Home Secretary Sajid Javid was lined up to announce a crackdown on knife crime, but the Gosport hospital deaths report meant it was Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who stepped in with a statement.Conservative MPs were very surprised to see Paul Flynn turn up to vote. He hadn\u0027t been seen around the Commons for some time and Tory whips assumed he was too ill to vote. Labour\u0027s numbers were also boosted by the new MP for Lewisham East, Janet Daby, elected in a by-election last week.But as it turned out, the government won fairly comfortably by 16 votes, after a behind-the-scenes deal with the leader of the Tory rebels, Dominic Grieve, meant all but the most die-hard pro-Remain mutineers backed down and voted with the government.There were just six Tory rebels: Heidi Allen (South Cambridgeshire) Ken Clarke (Rushcliffe) Phillip Lee (Bracknell), who quit as a minister last week Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury) Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) and Sarah Wollaston (Totnes).There were only four Labour rebels, despite earlier claims by Labour Brexiteers that there may be as many as 15.They were the usual suspects: Frank Field (Birkenhead) Kate Hoey (Vauxhall) John Mann (Bassetlaw) and Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton).

Second, what about the sacrifice of Dr Lee?He quit the government last week over its handling of Brexit but when the amendment was put to a vote he decided to abstain. Today, he voted against the government, but found himself on the losing side.So he has lost his government job and lost his fight in parliament on Brexit.

The Tory government is recruiting a \u0026pound70,000-a-year aviation negotiator for Brexit - who, er, doesn\u0027t need any knowledge of aviation. The statement has been spotted by eagle-eyed observers of the Department for Transport website. The new \u0027Head of Aviation EU Exit Negotiations\u0027 will lead the UK government\u0027s entire negotiation position on aviation in Brexit talks. The role will pay between \u0026pound62,500 and \u0026pound70,900 a year, and also involve making future aerospace laws and steering the future of our aviation safety. Despite all this, the job ad says: Prior knowledge of airspace and the aviation sector is an advantage but not necessary.  Labour MP Gareth Thomas, of anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: How can the government be advertising for vital jobs... yet not require experience in that sector? Planes will be grounded, holidays will be ruined and business operations will grind to a halt - all because this government has conducted Brexit like the political equivalent of Captain Mannering and Private Pike. This is becoming a national embarrassment. Ryanair also questioned why the job is only being advertised now - almost two years to the day after Britain voted to leave the EU.

Convention usually allows MPs who are on the Parlaimentary estate, but are too sick or elderly to physically walk through the voting lobbies to still have their votes counted. In practice this means even if an MP is in the Commons car park in an Ambulance, they can still vote. But Government whips are understood to have refused to accept this procedure, and are insisting on even infirm MPs physically passing through the lobbies in order to have their vote counted. Labour MP Naz Shah was seen being rolled through the Commons in a wheelchair this afternoon as MPs voted on the Brexit bill.  Pregnant Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson voted despite being past her due date. Tory chiefs allegedly imposed the measure amid fears they faced defeat before backing down in their latest EU (Withdrawal) Bill humiliation. A senior Downing Street source said they were unaware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate. But a Labour spokesman confirmed the party’s whips had been told “nodding through” would not be available. He said: “As I understand it there has been a refusal to nod through people who are not in a state to vote in the normal way, and that’s obviously unacceptable.” Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, of the Best for Britain campaign, said: “The Government played dirty on this one, using some real gutter tactics. “They tried to take advantage of sick and elderly Labour MPs in a desperate bid to win this Brexit vote, but had to concede with only hours to go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa makes last minute concession","story":"NewsTheresa May makes last-minute concession on Brexit bill in bid to prevent Remainer rebellionThe Government has proposed to let the House of Commons Speaker decide whether the motion put forward for the ‘meaningful vote’ would be amendable\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter14:20, 20 JUN 2018News (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May has made a last minute concession to her Brexit bill, which could give MPs the power to send her back to the negotiating table if she comes back without a deal.  The Government has proposed to let the House of Commons Speaker decide whether the motion put forward for the ‘meaningful vote’ would be amendable. Previously, Theresa May had insisted the vote would be on an ‘unamendable’ statement - meaning MPs would have their say, but it wouldn’t make a difference in practice. This new plan would give the Speaker the power to change that - and choose to give MPs a veto on the final deal. And it would effectively block ministers from overturning his decision.  MPs will vote tonight on two similar technical definitions of Theresa May\u0027s promise to give Parliament a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal - one proposed by the government, and one proposed by a pro-EU member of May\u0027s Conservative Party, Dominic Grieve. Parliament will decide which version to approve later on Wednesday in what is expected to be a very tight vote. The vote would be politically damaging for May to lose, and could make a \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit less likely. Mrs May’s Brexit team have been frantically negotiating with Remain-backing Tory MPs, hoping to find a compromise that would prevent an embarrassing rebellion.

Tory rebel ringleader Dominic Grieve has announced he will give his backing to the revised plan, indicating pro-EU will follow suit and vote with the government. Brexit Secretary David Davis wrote to MPs to inform them that an official ministerial statement will be issued on Thursday making clear it is ultimately for Speaker John Bercow to decide whether they get a meaningful vote on a no-deal withdrawal from the EU. MPs voted narrowly in favour of the government\u0027s position, by 319 votes to 303 - a majority of just 16. Mr Grieve pulled support for his own amendment, tabled by Viscount Hailsham in the Lords, which would give a meaningful vote in the Brexit process. Drawing groans from MPs on the Labour benches, he said: Having finally obtained, I have to say with a little bit more difficulty than I would have wished, the obvious acknowledgement of the sovereignty of this place over the executive in black and white language I am prepared to accept the Government\u0027s difficulty and support it. I am prepared to accept the Government\u0027s difficulty and in the circumstances to accept the form of amendment it wants.  Mr Grieve told MPs that if unsatisfied with the deal Parliament could issue a vote of no confidence or use other methods to bring its very clear view to bear on the Government. While pulling support for his amendment, he said he would still move it for MPs to vote and have their say. Prominent pro-EU Tory Nicky Morgan declared that she was ready to back the Government on this basis, raising the prospect that a rebellion thought likely to push the issue to a knife-edge may be on the point of crumbling. Potential Tory rebels were bristling at Theresa May\u0027s plan to offer only a symbolic vote on an unamendable neutral motion which would simply note that no agreement has been reached with Brussels.  They want a meaningful vote allowing them to approve or reject the Government\u0027s proposed next steps. The statement, which circulated in Westminster as debate began on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, made clear that Commons standing orders give the Speaker the final say on whether a motion is amendable or not. This may be enough to persuade some rebels that their concerns have been addressed, though it is thought likely that ministers will be confident of being able to draft a motion which will be judged neutral by Mr Bercow if the need arises. Ms Morgan tweeted: On this basis Parliament\u0027s vote is meaningful - and I will support (the) Government amendment. But prominent anti-Brexit rebel Anna Soubry appeared unconvinced, saying Mr Davis was dancing on the head of a pin and tweeting the hashtag #worldgonemad. Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon dismissed the compromise as a fudge, while Labour whips said it was meaningless. Meanwhile, Labour accused the Conservatives of refusing to co-operate with a long-standing convention permitting sick MPs to vote in Wednesday\u0027s division. Under the convention, MPs who are too ill to make their way through the voting lobbies can be nodded through from an ambulance or car parked in the parliamentary courtyard.  At least one Labour MP and possibly more were understood to be planning to come from hospital to be nodded through for Wednesday\u0027s crucial vote on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which could be decided by the narrowest of margins. A senior Downing Street source said he was not aware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate, but a Labour spokesman confirmed the party\u0027s whips had been told nodding through would not be available, denouncing the move as obviously unacceptable. Tory rebels believe they can inflict defeat on the Government as the flagship legislation returns to the Commons after the Lords again backed giving MPs a meaningful say on the final deal. The Prime Minister staved off a Tory rebellion on the move last week but faces a bruising battle in the latest round of voting amid claims she failed to implement a compromise that opponents believed they were promised. Phillip Lee, who resigned as a government minister in order to back a strengthened role for Parliament, acknowledged there had been a concerted effort to win over would-be rebels, including the dark arts of persuasion in the corridors of power.

The royal procession kicked off at 2pm just hours after a carriage horse broke loose and went running down Ascot High Street. An Ascot spokesperson later confirmed to the  that the animal was quickly caught and was not part of 2pm royal procession, which featured the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Although clouds were threatening downpours earlier the sunshine finally showed its face in time for the Queen\u0027s arrival as temperatures soared to 24C.   Charles and Camilla presented the winning prizes in the aptly-named Prince of Wales\u0027s Stakes at 4.20pm after Poet\u0027s Word created history to give Sir Michael Stoute a record-breaking 76th Royal Ascot victory. The Earl of Wessex performed the same prize-giving role in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at 3.40pm. The Queen watched on as her horse Seniority failed to secure top spot in the 5pm Royal Hunt Cup, with Settle for Bay running away with the title. Camilla looked smart in a green coat dress as she rode with her husband and nephew Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn ahead of The Lord and Lady Vestey, The Lord and Lady de Mauley, Michael Magnier, The Lady Susan Hussey and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Richards. Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, also joined the royal party this afternoon and were seen cheering on the horses from the stands. After the procession the royals were seen walking through the course chatting happily with each other as they made their way to the royal box.  The Queen was pictured flicking through one of the official programmes wearing a powder blue Stewart Parvin coat teamed with a Rachel Trevor-Morgan Milinery hat decorated with pink flowers. Husband Prince Phillip was noticeably absent as he was pictured riding his carriage around Windsor Castle instead. Olympian Mo Farah presented medals to jockey Oisin Murphy, Signora Cabello owner John Quinn and the Phoenix Thoroughbred team after they took part in the Queen Mary Stakes race.    Glam ladies and dapper gents poured into the Berkshire race course joined by a host of celebrities for day two of the sporting bonanza. Britain\u0027s Got Talent\u0027s Declan Donnelly was pictured at the races with pregnant wife Ali Astall this morning and Jeremy Kyle was joined by fiancee Vicky Burton.

TV presenter Lizzie Cundy was pictured sporting an all red show stopper while stylist Charlie Elmy-Britton and celebrity milliner Layla Leigh posed in purple and white numbers by the racing track.      Security remains in force today with punters facing breathalyser tests and bag searches as organisers seek to clamp down on anti-social behaviour this year. Yesterday the excitement seemed to have got a bit too much for quite a few race-goers , who were pictured having a lie down on the grass and swigging from champagne bottles. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle joined the Queen on the first day of the huge sporting event and presented the winning trophy for the 4.20pm race, the St James\u0027 Palace Stakes, to jockey Frankie Dettori after he galloped to glory on Without Parole. The Duke of Sussex watched on as his new wife was pecked on the hand by Dettori, who took top spot in the St James\u0027s Palace Stakes on Without Parole on the first of the five-day event this afternoon.  The Duchess wore a white Givenchy dress for her racing debut - Clare Waight Keller of the French fashion house designed her wedding gown - with a monochrome Philip Treacy hat. They arrived with the Queen on the royal carriage procession alongside Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Each day members of The Royal Family will travel in Ascot Landaus from Windsor Castle to the racecourse. The Queen - who yesterday wore a buttercup yellow coat dress, alongside daughter Princess Anne in blush pink - heads up the procession each day. Bookies traditionally take bets on the colour of the head of state\u0027s hat, and they had hoped to have better luck than Tuesday when the favourite yellow was heavily backed.  But Coral revealed they were left feeling blue on Day Two of Royal Ascot after the colour of the Queen’s hat was successfully predicted by punters for the second day running. Blue had been backed into the 2-1 favourite ahead of the Royal Procession and Coral customers were left cheering as the Queen emerged wearing a light blue headpiece.“It’s the second day running the favourite in the betting for the Queen’s hat has won and a lot of our customers will be thanking Her Majesty as they collect their winnings. It’s left us feeling a little blue and perhaps the Queen will be looking to back Shades of Blue, or maybe even Come on Leicester in the first race if blue is to be the colour today at Ascot,” said Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead.  The procession was followed by The Queen Mary Stakes at 2.30pm, The Queen\u0027s Vase at 3.05pm, The Duke of Cambridge Stakes at 3.40pm, The Prince of Wales Stakes at 4.20pm, The Royal Hunt Cup at 5pm and The Jersey Stakes at 5.35pm. This year Ascot management has scrapped the practice of roaming alcohol sellers in the stands and enlisted trained sniffer dogs to monitor attendees. There has also been a crackdown on beer sales and an increased stewarding presence. Organisers also installed ‘drug amnesty boxes’ for the safe disposal of illegal substances at the popular annual event which runs until Saturday.

Louis Fice, 16, was sent home for wearing shorts instead of trousers during the recent heatwave. And now the tough army cadet says he will wear his navy two-inch-above-the-knee skirt every day - borrowed from one of his female friends. The sixth former claims he is now fighting for equality for all genders after teachers scolded him for wearing his makeshift uniform. Louis, a student at Aberaeron high school in Aberaeron, Mid Wales, said: Let’s stop this inequality and get shorts in the dress code - it’s 2018, not 1950.  I got sent home Wednesday for wearing shorts because I was hot and my shorts are \u0027not in the dress code\u0027 yet girls were walking around in skirts. So to break the barrier I turned up in a skirt and was told by every teacher to change. I\u0027m not just fighting for equality for boys, I\u0027m fighting for equality across the board. He described his long trousers as being uncomfortable in the summer - especially with a heatwave forecast for the next week.

He also claimed he was banned from Grosvenor Casino back nine years ago.  Both Rainbow Casino and Grosvenor Casino refused to comment when approached by BirminghamLive .  Now Balvinder has revealed his \u0027two corner fraction betting system\u0027 which he claims has made him tens of thousands of pounds in casinos throughout Europe.  The system sees Mr Sambhi play eight numbers by placing a chip on two \u0027corners\u0027. He waits 12 spins where the numbers 8, 9, 11, 12 AND 26, 27, 29, 30 do not win. Then he places two chips on two corners, to ensure he wins if the ball lands in 8,9,11, 12 or 26, 27, 29 and 30. He then waits another 12 losing spins with no winning appearance of those numbers, before repeating the bet - which he says offers him odds of 4.5/1.  Mr Sambhi, 46, said: ‘‘I’ve never lost with my system and the casinos don’t like that. ‘‘They don’t want winners in their premises – just losers. “I even deliberately lose on some days to give the casino a little back so I am not seen as a constant winner. Mr Sambhi has written a book about his system called Breaking The Roulette Wheel. He added: “Experts have always said that winning at roulette is just down to luck. But I’ve developed a system based on simple mathematics which helps me win every time I play. “Some days I win a little and some days a lot. My biggest single daily win was just over \u0026pound4,000. ‘‘But the fact is I was winning consistently and nobody has ever done that before with roulette.

Authorities are warning families to urgently return the cough syrups to the shop from which they were bought. One of the ingredients in the medicines could cause them to grow to mould, which would make children very unwell or cause reactions. Affected products include some own-brand syrups from Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u0027s, Superdrug, Wilko and Tesco. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said only a small number of batches from eight different products are being recalled and no other cough syrups are affected.  Check if you have any of the listed cough syrups and if you do, please don\u0027t use them, take them back to where you bought them from, said the MHRA\u0027s Dr Sam Atkinson. The mould is not always visible, so return any of the affected cough syrup bottles, even if it looks okay to use. If your child has recently taken one of these cough syrups and, in the unlikely event that they have become unwell or had a reaction, please speak to your GP, pharmacist or other healthcare professional. Our highest priority is making sure the medicines you and your family take are safe. This is why, even though there is a low risk of a reaction, we have asked the company to carry out this recall and why we want people to check their medicine cabinets.

The family, who wished not to be named, said the children reacted like a pack of wild animals when asked whether they had had stolen a set of keys to the family\u0027s van. In an interview with the Liverpool Echo, the family - including two grandparents, their daughter, son-in-law and grandson - explained how the children slashed and stabbed them with weapons, including a knives, screwdriver and a large, curved flick blade. The grandmother said the incident, in Broadgreen, Liverpool, came after the family were alerted by a neighbour their van had been broken into.  The 76-year-old said: I was getting ready to go to the quiz at the pub over the road and the bell rang. And it was the lad over the road, and he said - \u0027I have just seen a lad going into your husband\u0027s van.\u0027  \u0027He opened it, went into the van and looked around, then went away, then came running back again and took something out of the van.\u0027 The pensioner said she told her husband about the incident and told him to go and lock it, which is when he realised he had left the keys in the ignition and they had been stolen. She added: My husband and son-in-law were then trying to get the battery out of the cars on the drive, because the van keys had my car key on it as well and we knew they would come back for them. The pensioner said her grandson spotted a group of lads acting suspiciously, not far from the house, and the family including both 76-year-old grandparents, daughter, son-in-law and grandson, walked over. She added: There was four of them and we didn\u0027t bounce over and we said \u0027we don\u0027t want any problems or trouble, we just want the keys back.\u0027 And that\u0027s when they turned gangster and said \u0027we haven\u0027t got any keys you cheeky f******g b*****s. So my daughter said again, \u0027we don\u0027t want any bother, if it was your dad you would want the same, he is a pensioner, just give him the key\u0027. And that is when one of them just punched my husband in the face and pulled out a knife.  The grandmother said the group began jumping on the backs of her family, trying to slash and stab them, during which the van keys fell out of the pocket of one of them. She said: They were animals. They were jumping on our backs, they went to stab me and my daughter shouted he is going to stab you and pulled me away. I was in shock. They were kicking the hell out of the three of them and just kept swinging and slashing with their knives. During the fight they dropped the keys - they fell out of one of their pockets. All of this over some keys. We were literally fighting for our lives. One had a screwdriver and two had Stanley knives and one had a big curved flick blade.  They pulled their hoods up and my husband said he remembers just seeing big brown wide eyes, then he had his face slashed. Then one of them pulled this flick knife from a bum bag and stabbed my grandson Jack and blood was just gushing out. And my daughter was shouting \u0027he has been stabbed, he\u0027s been stabbed\u0027. The grandmother said one of the gang scratched her daughter\u0027s face and broke her tooth, meanwhile another used a screwdriver to attack her son-in-law who suffered injuries to his back, legs and arms. Her grandson, aged 20, was taken to hospital with a stab wound to his stomach and is in a stable condition, however his family were told it could have been much worse. The grandmother said: The blade nicked his liver, the surgeon said if it had been an inch either side he wouldn\u0027t be here. He is very lucky.  He didn\u0027t think he was going to make it - he even said to his dad \u0027if I don\u0027t make it this is the name of one of them who did this.\u0027 He was supposed to be going to Thailand on Friday for a two week holiday - I was going for his money today. My husband has had five heart bypasses, he has had bowel cancer, I have had cancer, we have all been through it - we don\u0027t need anything else. Her husband, also 76, said: If you see someone\u0027s keys in someone\u0027s van you knock on and say your keys are here - you don\u0027t rob them.What is this mentality that when you get dressed you put a knife in your pocket?

It always sounds so easy in theory: grab some crisps and sandwiches, head out to the nearest green space with the family and let the good times roll. But in reality, there\u0027s always something vital that gets forgotten. Like spoons. Or something to sit on. So to help you enjoy the sunny days in style, we\u0027ve put together some handy tips.  Keep your cool    No one wants a limp, soggy sandwich - so refrigeration is important for lunch. You could keep things cool with a pre-frozen ice pack, but they tend to over-cool the food near them, which can spoil certain foods. Instead it\u0027s better to get a coolbox with a built-in refrigeration system. The Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox is ideal for \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) because you can use either a mains or car power supply to keep those cucumber sandwiches chilled.   Let the kids help make the lunch (yes, really)   If you\u0027ve got small kids, then get them involved in making the lunch. Get some plastic containers, like Halfords Plastic Stacking Containers , currently half price at \u0026pound6, and have them put either fruit or salad into each.   They can either be responsible for their own - or if you\u0027re feeling brave, the whole lunch. Just prepare yourself for a rogue strawberry in the tomatoes!  Be prepared for rain (this is the UK, after all)   There\u0027s no need to worry about sudden inclement weather at a well-planned picnic.  Make sure you pack the Halfords 300 Fully Waterproof Gazebo , \u0026pound69 (was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21). This rather brilliant shelter will hold off heavy rain and offers 50+ UV protection, so no matter what\u0027s happening to the weather - you\u0027re going to be covered.   Also grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , currently half price at \u0026pound10 - so that even if the grass is a bit damp, you can be sure of a dry place to sit.  Armed with these, you\u0027ll be able to eat in comfort whatever the British weather brings.  Don\u0027t compromise on cutlery  No matter what you packed for your picnic you\u0027re going to want to eat it off something nice. Taking plates, bowls and cutlery means that you can take anything you like on your picnic. In the mood for pasta, rice, or potato salad? No problem, if you\u0027ve got knives and forks for all.   These Halfords sets of bowls, plates and cutlery all come in awesome bright colours - and they\u0027re all currently half price. Packs of six Bowls , six Plates , and 18 pieces of Cutlery are priced at just \u0026pound3 each. All-in-all that\u0027s a lot of mouths you\u0027ll be able to feed in rainbow style!   The Five Fs      The \u0027five Fs\u0027 are the key to a great picnic. The first four are family, friends, food and furniture. We\u0027ve dealt with food already, and it\u0027s nice and cool, thanks to the coolbox. You\u0027ve got your family and friends with you too - and they all need somewhere to sit. That\u0027s where the furniture comes in.  For optimum comfort grab some Urban Escape Moonchairs for the adults, \u0026pound30 (half price) and a few Kids Folding Chairs \u0026pound5, (half price) for the little ones.   A Halfords Roll Up Aluminum Table , \u0026pound20 (was \u0026pound30, save \u0026pound10) will finish this off to perfection.   Now, the adults can sit back with a glass of wine - served in durable Acrylic Wine Glasses , (half price at \u0026pound5 for four) - while the kids take care of the final \u0027F\u0027...   Fun!

Despite being one of the most famous women in the world right now, Meghan was given a name tag. And she wasn\u0027t the only one, as all the royals had one of the purple badges with their full names and details of which areas they were allowed into. But unlike her husband Harry and sister-in-law Kate at previous events, Meghan didn\u0027t wear hers and instead carried it with her clutch bag.  Lots of royal fans thought she broke the rules by not attaching it to her gorgeous off-white Givenchy dress, but it turns out that isn\u0027t the case. Many of the other royals - including Princess Anne, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice - also decided not to pin actually wear their tag for this year\u0027s event.  However all the royal gents, including Prince Charles and Harry had theirs proudly pinned to their jackets. Although they all have to have a badge to get through security they don\u0027t actually have to wear them, reports People. There\u0027s only one person who doesn\u0027t need a name badge at all - the Queen.  Meghan\u0027s off-white dress was made completely from a delicate material so a pin would have left a mark. In previous years her sister-in-law Kate has worn lace dresses, which wouldn\u0027t have been ruined by sticking the badge through it. Meghan made her Royal Ascot debut just weeks after marrying into the family, while Kate waited five years.

A survey conducted by webuyanycar found an increasing number of motorists are now relying on dash cam technology to protect themselves and to monitor other road users.  Over 60 per cent have recorded a road traffic accident, dangerous driving, a car related crime or anti-social behaviour from pedestrians.  A recent freedom of information request by webuyanycar revealed the politan Police have reported a seven per cent reduction of motor collisions, year-on-year, from March 2017 to March 2018.  On average, there were approximately 397 fewer collisions per month on the Met Police’s roads in the 12 months leading up to March 2018, than the previous year.  Data from the Met Police also revealed a dramatic reduction in Traffic Offence Reports and Fixed Penalty Notices in the past 12 months, dropping by a staggering 30 per cent. Over a third of those with a cam have captured footage of dangerous driving, including tailgating, while 12 per cent have caught anti-social behaviour from pedestrians on camera. With the rise of ‘cash for crash’ incidents, some dash cam users have managed to record a fraudulent crash on their dash cam.   Richard Evans, head of technical services at webuyanycar , said: “We’re huge advocates of safe driving here at webuyanycar and it’s great to see a rise in motorists investing in motor safety technology.  “It is reassuring to see that road traffic accidents are on the decline and we hope that the number of collisions on the UK’s roads continues to drop. As motor technology evolves, we look forward to seeing future developments in technology that will help to make our roads a safer place.” Richard Evans added: “It is important for motorists to feel safe behind the wheel and that is undoubtedly driving the rise in dash cam use.  “Safety and security is also important when selling a car and that’s why webuyanycar offers motorists a safe place to sell their car in our branches nationwide.”   The survey reported that eight in 10 of those with a dash cam say it offers them peace of mind if they’re ever involved in a road traffic accident, while almost a quarter say the cam makes them feel safer on the road. Another 16 per cent of drivers reported feeling more conscious of hazards on the road with a dash cam fitted.  The research, commissioned by webuyanycar , showed that drivers in Northern Ireland are most likely to have a dash cam fitted than anywhere else in the UK, with 29 per cent of motorist investing in the technology.

Posted by Melissa Hope (@lissalet) the tweet informed people of what they should do if a service dog approaches them on its own. It reads: So today I tripped. Fell flat on my face, it was awful but ultimately harmless. My service dog, however, is trained to go get an adult if I have a seizure, and he assumed this was a seizure. I went after him after I had dusted off my jeans and ego, and I found him trying to get the attention of a very annoyed woman. She was swatting him away and telling him to go away. So I feel like I need to make this heads up.    If a service dog without a person approaches you, it means the person is down and in need of help. Don\u0027t get scared, don\u0027t get annoyed, follow the dog! Thousands of people have shared the post, admitting they had no idea they were meant to follow the dog. However many also don\u0027t realise this isn\u0027t the case for support dogs in the UK. A spokeswoman for the charity Support Dogs, which trains seizure alert dogs to give an advance warning of an epileptic seizure of up to 55 minutes, said that they did not train their assistance dogs to run off or go for help in case of an emergency.  Instead support dogs will often stay with their owner and bark to attract attention to the situation. Toni Brown-Griffin, of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, is blind and epileptic. Because of this, she is supported by a black Labrador cross named Hetty, who is the first dog to be dually trained as both a seizure alert dog and a guide dog in the UK. Toni and Hetty have been together for seven and a half years, with the talented pooch set to retire in a matter of weeks. Throughout their time with one another, Hetty has been an incredible support to mum-of-two Toni when she has a seizure.  The 48-year-old has two different types of seizure and Hetty is able to work out which type she will have and when she is going to have it, alerting her before it happens so she can get to a safe space. The dog, who has won numerous awards for her service over the years, also assists with physical tasks, including taking Toni\u0027s top off, picking things up that have been dropped and finding things Toni has lost. In reference to Melissa\u0027s advice, Toni revealed that Hetty would never go off and seek help from a stranger.

But one woman\u0027s so-called acne cure has to be one of the most bizarre - and unpalatable - so far.  The unnamed American woman and dog-lover claims drinking her dog\u0027s urine helped clear her bad acne. In a video where she details her theory for why this has worked for her, she says: Many of you have asked me how I always look so good, how my makeup always looks so perfect, or how I always have this natural glow.

While urotherapy used to be practised in ancient China, Rome, Greece and Egypt, it\u0027s not a practise which health experts today endorse. Not only that, but no studies have provided sufficient evidence of its efficacy or health benefits.   It\u0027s a bizarre concept, Mr Zaki Almallah, consultant urologist at BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham tells Marie Claire .  The kidneys filter the blood and any excess fluid, and salts and minerals are expelled. The point of urination is to rid the body of excess.

Around eight tonnes were collected from the shore between the eastern resort of Nerja and Velez-Malaga just east of Malaga and another three tonnes between Torremolinos and Mijas. The situation was getting back to normal on Wednesday after a wipe-out weekend described as one of the worst since 2012. The jellyfish have been identified as mauve stingers, whose stings are said to produce a burning sensation, intense pain, inflammation and red rashes.  Around 150 people are reported to have been stung in the last few days on the Costa del Sol. The high number of jellyfish has been blamed on unseasonal rains and strong winds which brought them towards the shoreline just as the weather turned and a sudden rise in temperatures made beaches busier. Council cleaners were filmed on one beach using rakes to sift the animals out of the sand before scooping them into black plastic bin liners with shovels. A canoeist filmed himself paddling through jellyfish-infested waters near the shoreline as he said: “They’re packed in like sardines. This is incredible.” Tractors were also used to clear many of the jellyfish from the shoreline.  One holidaymaker described the situation as “horrible”, saying: “I’d love to get in the water but I daren’t. It’s horrible.” Last month bathers were banned from the water along much of the Costa Blanca because of Portuguese Men O’War. An 11-year-old boy was rushed to hospital after being stung by one of the jellyfish-like creatures on the few beaches that remained open on some of the most popular parts of the coastline with Brit holidaymakers. The red flag was also hoisted at La Marina beach near Elche - where the youngster was hurt - after he was stung. Lifeguards removed the animal’s tentacles from his arm but he was taken to nearby Elche Hospital after complaining of stomach and neck pain. He was discharged a few hours later after receiving treatment.

It took doctors three years to figure out why Mariah, 11, was so ill and specialists eventually determined that the dangerous black mould could be the cause. The girl had been exposed to the toxic mould every day she attended school. Speaking to Australia\u0027s 9News , Hayley said: It was black mould through her carpet, it was on walls, i could smell it from a mile away and Mariah could as well. Mariah was constantly unwell and suffered from severe nausea and her weight dropped dramatically.  Her mum added: Every organ in her body was pretty much inflamed. As a drastic measure, her family even moved from New South Wales to Queensland to be close to her doctor and with the hopes that the warmer climate would help her. At one point Mariah was so sick that she could not attend school or play with other children. Federal MP Lucy Wicks is now leading the charge for a national inquiry in Australia into the hidden danger of black mould. She has experienced similar symptoms when her house was damaged during a storm and black mould took hold.  Within a week or two I began to get some very strange symptoms, pneumonia, asthma, got very tired, she said. She was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS). My skin would feel like I was on fire, my brain would feel like it wasn\u0027t working properly, she said. I started writing my speeches down in parliament to avoid the embarrassment of not being able to remember the words that suddenly just might not be there. It was a really tough time.

Stood underneath a sagging \u0026shymakeshift shelter, I look on as jagged bolts of lightning streak the black sky and the wind whips up. This temporary city, cobbled together in less than a year with bamboo poles, scraps of tarpaulin and twine, looks like it will be knocked down any instant. For the 700,000 Rohingya refugees here in Bangladesh – who have escaped the worst genocide of this century in neighbouring Myanmar – the storms I witness are just the beginning of a three-month nightmare.  Their temporary homes are directly in the path of the cyclones that plague this vulnerable region from now until September. After being tortured and raped – and seeing their relatives murdered by soldiers in Myanmar who torched their villages – they are now prey to landslides, floods and waterborne diseases. Scores of people have died in recent days, including a two-year-old boy after a mud wall collapsed on him. At a Red Cross field hospital on the edge of the seemingly never-ending Kutupalong camp is nine-month-old Mohammad Ayas.  The helpless little boy broke his thigh bone when he fell from one of the treacherous slopes between the shelters. Icelandic nurse Hildur Sveinsdottir – here for a one-month secondment from her normal A\u0026ampE job – tells me such accidents are soon expected to occur daily. Fractures are very regular for us,” Hildur says. “It’s unimaginable what it will be like in a few weeks. The number of people getting injured or being killed will rise a lot if they get a really bad cyclone. Their shelters will not stand up.”  Experts say more than 200,000 people are at high risk from landslides and floods in the coming monsoon months. More than 1,000 shelters have already been destroyed as rivers of brown water surge through the narrow alleys of the camp, an hour from Cox’s Bazar city, on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. Assisted by aid workers, the Rohingya are digging drainage ditches and reinforcing their shelters.  Despite the extraordinary hardship they have endured, everyone I come across is determined to make the best of an appalling situation. Trucks bearing stacks of bamboo arrive at temporary depots all day long. Many of those collecting the only building materials on offer are boys, straining to carry their heavy load. In many cases, their fathers were murdered in Myanmar. Their mothers guard their precious scrap of land and look after younger siblings.  More than half of the people here are women and at least 60% are under 18. Many of them will be trapped once the paths become impassable. Speaking next to a stagnant pool of fetid brown water, mum Moriom Katu, 35, tells me her eight-month-old son died from dysentery and diarrhoea a few weeks before. “This is our fate,” she says. “We were shot at, burned and tortured as we tried to get away, and now we are here in this terrible location. Everything is so dirty. The water is full of diseases. People are getting sick all the time.”  Now she is concerned that her surviving children, a girl aged seven and a boy aged four, will be struck down by the same illness. There is never a quiet moment for the dedicated Red Cross medics. Hildur says: “We have respiratory problems, malnutrition cases, dehydration and infections that turn to abscesses because the water they have to clean cuts with is dirty. “There has been measles and TB. They want to wash and they want to take care of themselves, but the hygiene is so bad.”  On the 15-bed paediatric ward is a premature baby so tiny that I inhale sharply when I first see her. Unbelievably, Umme Kulsul is two months old. Her arms and legs are the width of an adult finger, but she has grown. Hildur tells me she was just ten centimetres long when she was born by emergency caesarean when her mother, Annuar Begum, 30, was only seven months pregnant. This was due to serious health problems, \u0026shyexacerbated by the escape from Myanmar to Bangladesh.  Since then, Umme has needed 24-hour medical care, yet I am told that in just over a week she will have to go back to the family’s shelter in the squalid camp down the road. It is difficult to imagine how her tiny body will withstand the elements. Equally at risk is Abdullah, 22, whose left leg is encased in bandages. He was shot while trying to flee the military’s reign of terror in Myanmar. “They surrounded my village,” Abdullah tells me. “While some soldiers torched the straw roof of our house, others lay in wait to fire at us.  “We were all screaming but they kept shooting. I was shot in the leg. “The bullet pierced right through my thigh and came out the other side of my leg. My aunt and uncle were killed in the crossfire.” Abdullah’s wound became badly infected because of the unsanitary conditions in the camp, and Red Cross nurses are doing their best to save his leg from amputation. Yet when he returns to his shelter, his wound will be exposed again.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Bus-journey-01-940x372.jpg ","title":"bus firms in plea to ease congestion as commute times in dundee and tayside soar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRush hour commuting times across Tayside have soared in the past decade, according to a local bus firm.Stagecoach East says that congestion has caused the time taken for some journeys in Dundee and Perth to increase by up to a third in the last decade.The company is now calling for fresh action from politicians to help it reduce congestion and emissions throughout Tayside.Stagecoach East managing director Paul Thomas said “short-sighted” transport policies are having a major impact on local bus users.His comments come after Transport Minister Humza Yousaf retabled new proposals at Holyrood to improve local bus services.Mr Thomas said: “This is not specifically about Stagecoach, or any other bus company – it’s about the impact of congestion on bus passengers and other road users in the area and the situation simply cannot continue if we are to carry on improving the local bus network and our environment.“Our passengers are paying the price for short-sighted policies that have led us to this point – we urgently need politicians to take practical action to get our towns and cities moving again.”According to the bus company, afternoon peak journey times on Stagecoach services from Ninewells Hospital to the city centre have increased by 20% in the last 10 years.Morning peak journey times between Broughty Ferry and Seagate have also increased by 31% over the same period.In Perth, meanwhile, morning peak journey times from Walnut Grove into the city centre have risen by 33% since 2010Mr Thomas added: “Effective bus networks can boost the local economy, improve traffic flow, reduce air pollution and help improve air quality.“We are playing our part by investing in improvements for customers including digital technology, new routes and new vehicles, but we need politicians to play their part to help buses flourish. All of the tools exist for them to take action now.”Stagecoach has written to local MPs, MSPs and councillors about the impact of congestion and how it is affecting customers every day.The company has also reported a 10% decrease in operating speed leading to an 8% rise in operating costs – with fears it could lead to fewer people using buses.The Transport (Scotland) Bill – which could see the introduction of low emission zones in cities, a ban on pavement parking and improvements to smart ticket schemes – is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament.Xplore Dundee’s new managing director Christine McGlasson recently told the Tele that congestion was a major issue affecting journey times for city customers.According to research issued by Greener Journeys, the UK Government’s seven-year freeze on fuel duty has resulted in a 4% increase in traffic since 2011.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Stagecoach is referring mainly to local roads and city centre congestion in this instance, although we do appreciate the frustration that delays can cause on our trunk roads and motorways too. Since 2007, more than £6.5 billion has been invested in the network and that includes major improvements which can bring congestion relief, not only on the trunk road network but to local roads, resulting in benefits for car and bus users.“We are continuing to spend more than £250 million a year to support our vital bus industry, allowing operators to keep fares at affordable levels and provide free bus travel to older and disabled passengers.“We also provide support to local authorities via the block grant so that they can support socially necessary bus services.“We have also doubled our active travel budget from £40m-£80m which will greatly improve public health and ease congestion.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the Tele’s build up concludes with our lowdown on the final section, Group H, possibly the least fashionable of all the groups, hipsters apart.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan

The connection with the charity came about because Andrew is father-in-law to a friend of Emily Crossley, a former reporter and anchor for Channel 4 News and CNN International, who co-founded the charity in 2012 after her son Eli was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. (DMD)Emily has advocated for patients around the world and spoken many times in the Houses of Parliament.The trust raised \u0026pound3.5million in its first three years, and then six years ago started the annual Duchenne Dash, which with big sponsors such as Maserati, brings in millions for research and also raises awareness of the horrible disease. Last year\u0027 Dash raised \u0026pound1 million.DMD is an inherited genetic disorder passed on by the mother that leads to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Symptom onset is usually between ages three and five and the disease primarily affects boys, although in rare cases it can affect girls.Sonia, who completed this year\u0027 Loch Ness Etape as part of her training, said: \"Every week, two families in the UK are given the devastating news that their son has DMD, and we believe there are at least two cases in the north.\"The Paris dash is to raise money for research and raise awareness.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process. There will be the option of pre-registration for exhibits the automatic production of labelling for the paintings and photos instant printing of receipts and immediate production of a list of entries to guide visitors.As in past years, people who come to view the exhibition will have free entry, with the option of making a suitable donation to the funds of the society. There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"working to preserve the yarns of yesteryear","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/06/18, 7:14 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPeople across Argyll and Bute are being encouraged to take part in a unique project that will help to preserve tales about the area for future generations.Argyll and Bute Youth Services is calling on people of all ages to help gather stories, film clips, photographs and objects about the area to celebrate the uniqueness of Argyll and Bute.The Digital Storytelling Project is part of the national Year of Young People and aims to bring together our younger and older generations to share their stories and folklore tales of yesteryear.Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: \u0026#8216This is not only a great way of capturing precious stories about the area, but it’s an excellent opportunity for a mix of generations to work together.\u0026#8216Argyll is teeming with folklore tales, from giant serpents and mermaids being spotted on our coastlines in years gone by, to stories of haunted caves and bloody battles \u0026#8211 we’ve got a lot to talk about.\u0026#8216The Year of Young People is all about bringing generations together and celebrating our young people.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone.

She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12704340.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/35265670_1680890188694011_7257840954613170176_n.jpg","title":"public hunt dog vanished irvine","story":"NewsPublic hunt for dog that vanished on Irvine beachMaisey\u0027s been missing for almost 24 hours.\u0026nbspShareByRoss Dunn11:04, 14 JUN 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dog owner is urging the public to keep an eye out for her missing pooch.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Glee as Melrose Primary choir raises the roof in Perth","story":"PERFORMING pupils from Melrose are officially amongst the best in Scotland.\nThe

colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the

savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

That is unacceptable, she said.\nMrs McDonald said she expects Irish leaders and their EU partners will make that absolutely clear to Mrs May and the UK Government.\nSpeaking earlier, Mrs McDonald said: \u0026ldquoWe are here because Brexit poses a real and imminent danger to Irish interests both north and south.\n\u0026ldquoWe are here because the British system so far has failed to come up with a credible proposal that would protect the Good Friday Agreement, that would prevent a hardening of the border and would protect citizens\u0026rsquo rights.\n\u0026ldquoDespite all of the rhetoric Theresa May has drawn a blank by way of response to those issues, so we believe that there\u0026rsquos game playing, there\u0026rsquos brinksmanship and that the Tory Government are playing a game of chicken with Brexit and with Ireland. We find that unacceptable, she said.\nHer comments come amid an ongoing impasse between the EU and UK on how to avoid a hard border post-Brexit.\nBoth sides have agreed to include a so-called backstop option in the withdrawal treaty. The measure would commit the UK to align with an EU regulatory framework in the absence of a wider trade deal.\nBut the shape of that fall-back remains a sticking point, with the EU dismissing the UK suggestion it should be a temporary arrangement, even if a broader agreement fails to materialise.\nMrs McDonald reiterated Sinn Fein\u0026rsquos call for the Prime Minister to grant Northern Ireland special status, allowing it to remain in the customs union and the single market.\nMrs McDonald added: \u0026ldquoThe British Government know what the answer is. They know precisely what the answer is but they\u0026rsquore playing games and I think certainly patience has run out with that approach. It\u0026rsquos dangerous, it\u0026rsquos reckless.\nDuring their visit to London the powersharing impasse was also on the agenda.\nThe devolved executive led by Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists collapsed 18 months ago, leaving Northern Ireland effectively governed by the civil service.\nBoth Mrs McDonald and Mrs O\u0026rsquoNeill blamed the stalemate between the Sinn Fein and the DUP on the Unionists\u0026rsquo coalition with the Tories since last summer\u0026rsquos general election.\n\u0026ldquoThe DUP have gone into hiding \u0026ndash they have a very toxic relationship under Theresa May\u0026rsquos wing, said Mrs McDonald.\nMrs O\u0026rsquoNeill added: \u0026ldquoThis political vacuum has been allowed because of this relationship and is all about trying to keep the Tories in power at the expense of government in the north of Ireland.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not acceptable. The British Government need to step up and play their role as co-guarantors of our peace process.\n\u0026ldquoThey need to step up and deliver rights that are available elsewhere to other citizens here whether that be marriage equality or language rights \u0026ndash all things that are freely available across these islands but not to people in the north.\n\u0026ldquoWe are being treated as this little backwater area where we can\u0026rsquot get our rights and we\u0026rsquore being denied economic prosperity because of Brexit.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just not a tolerable situation so that\u0026rsquos the message we would bring loud and clear to Theresa May today.\nIn a statement ahead of Wednesday\u0026rsquos meeting, the DUP branded Sinn Fein glorified lobbyists because of their boycott of the executive, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons.\nThe DUP\u0026rsquos deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP said: \u0026ldquoThey sit on the outside as spectators dependent on others to get decisions made.\n\u0026ldquoMeanwhile, the DUP MPs will be in the House of Commons using our votes to deliver more money for hospitals and schools and ensure we get the best deal for Northern Ireland as we exit the EU.\n\u0026ldquoSinn Fein\u0026rsquos blame game may seem attractive inside their organisation but to people who need ministers to make decisions in Northern Ireland

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.

The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.

However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.

They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.  Musselburgh is the company\u0026rsquos first of its so-called \u0026lsquoClapham-style\u0026rsquo stores in Scotland.  Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience. I am sure that they will feel that it has been worth it when they experience the new store."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7384717.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"UK playing game of chicken over Irish border  claims Sinn Fein","story":"              Sinn Fein leaders have accused the UK Government of playing a game of chicken over the question of the Irish border.  Party president Mary Lou McDonald and vice-president Michelle O\u0026rsquoNeill were in London on Wednesday for a meeting with Theresa May on the key Brexit sticking point.  Mrs McDonald said it is very clear that the Government is \u0026ldquoplaying for time, running down the clock, and playing what we believe is a very, very dangerous game of brinkmanship.  She said they heard nothing new from Mrs May in what she described as a frank meeting.  Asked if there was anything positive to come out of the meeting, Mrs McDonald told reporters: \u0026ldquoNo. We heard rhetoric which at this stage is well worn.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard again the contradictory message of protecting Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, no hardening of the border, but yet a determination to leave the single market and the customs union and to take the north with them.  Mrs McDonald said everything they heard in the meeting adds to their worries, rather than relieving their concerns.  \u0026ldquoThe British now wish to leapfrog, set aside, disregard, the Irish question, to pursue their own interests in respect of a new relationship that they may wish to craft.  \u0026ldquoThat is very dangerous for Ireland. That is unacceptable, she said.  Mrs McDonald said she expects Irish leaders and their EU partners will make that absolutely clear to Mrs May and the UK Government.  Speaking earlier, Mrs McDonald said: \u0026ldquoWe are here because Brexit poses a real and imminent danger to Irish interests both north and south.  \u0026ldquoWe are here because the British system so far has failed to come up with a credible proposal that would protect the Good Friday Agreement, that would prevent a hardening of the border and would protect citizens\u0026rsquo rights.  \u0026ldquoDespite all of the rhetoric Theresa May has drawn a blank by way of response to those issues, so we believe that there\u0026rsquos game playing, there\u0026rsquos brinksmanship and that the Tory Government are playing a game of chicken with Brexit and with Ireland. We find that unacceptable, she said.  Her comments come amid an ongoing impasse between the EU and UK on how to avoid a hard border post-Brexit.  Both sides have agreed to include a so-called backstop option in the withdrawal treaty. The measure would commit the UK to align with an EU regulatory framework in the absence of a wider trade deal.  But the shape of that fall-back remains a sticking point, with the EU dismissing the UK suggestion it should be a temporary arrangement, even if a broader agreement fails to materialise.  Mrs McDonald reiterated Sinn Fein\u0026rsquos call for the Prime Minister to grant Northern Ireland special status, allowing it to remain in the customs union and the single market.  Mrs McDonald added: \u0026ldquoThe British Government know what the answer is. They know precisely what the answer is but they\u0026rsquore playing games and I think certainly patience has run out with that approach. It\u0026rsquos dangerous, it\u0026rsquos reckless.  During their visit to London the powersharing impasse was also on the agenda.  The devolved executive led by Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists collapsed 18 months ago, leaving Northern Ireland effectively governed by the civil service.  Both Mrs McDonald and Mrs O\u0026rsquoNeill blamed the stalemate between the Sinn Fein and the DUP on the Unionists\u0026rsquo coalition with the Tories since last summer\u0026rsquos general election.  \u0026ldquoThe DUP have gone into hiding \u0026ndash they have a very toxic relationship under Theresa May\u0026rsquos wing, said Mrs McDonald.  Mrs O\u0026rsquoNeill added: \u0026ldquoThis political vacuum has been allowed because of this relationship and is all about trying to keep the Tories in power at the expense of government in the north of Ireland.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not acceptable. The British Government need to step up and play their role as co-guarantors of our peace process.  \u0026ldquoThey need to step up and deliver rights that are available elsewhere to other citizens here whether that be marriage equality or language rights \u0026ndash all things that are freely available across these islands but not to people in the north.  \u0026ldquoWe are being treated as this little backwater area where we can\u0026rsquot get our rights and we\u0026rsquore being denied economic prosperity because of Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just not a tolerable situation so that\u0026rsquos the message we would bring loud and clear to Theresa May today.  In a statement ahead of Wednesday\u0026rsquos meeting, the DUP branded Sinn Fein glorified lobbyists because of their boycott of the executive, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the House of Commons.  The DUP\u0026rsquos deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP said: \u0026ldquoThey sit on the outside as spectators dependent on others to get decisions made.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, the DUP MPs will be in the House of Commons using our votes to deliver more money for hospitals and schools and ensure we get the best deal for Northern Ireland as we exit the EU.  \u0026ldquoSinn Fein\u0026rsquos blame game may seem attractive inside their organisation but to people who need ministers to make decisions in Northern Ireland their tactics are becoming exposed."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7620739.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7730503.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc2 martini-tablet-src=/resources/images/7730503.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc3 martini-desktop-src=/resources/images/7730503.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Watch the moment famed Glasgow hairdresser is surprised with   137K Porsche prize","story":"              A FAMED Glasgow hairdresser received the surprise of a lifetime after winning a top-of-the-range Porsche worth \u0026pound137,000.

The damage was devastating but was contained by extraordinary feats of firefighting to the west wing of the building, and although the exquisite library was lost, no-one was killed or injured.  This time, the flames were hungrier they lit up the night sky and the neighbourhood again cleared of its residents.

Glasgow Council have stated that \u0026ldquothere is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, Historic Environment Scotland, and the art school is to save the building.  But surely the question is ought it to be replicated?  Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a superb architect, a gifted artist, and above all, a dynamic innovator. It is my contention that he would not approve of pastiche or replication.  Mackintosh won the competition for a new art school in 1897, while working as a draughtsman for Honeyman and Keppie, and attending the old art school part-time.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspHow the world reacted to the Glasgow School of Art\u0026nbspfire  The building was completed in two phases, the first phase in 1899. Over the following years, Mackintosh matured as an architect, honed his pared but organic design skills, and completed the second phase, the west wing.  The entire building was testimony to his creative genius and artistry.  Everyone loves Mackintosh now, but he was not always so well regarded in his home city.  It was 15 years before Honeyman and Keppie deigned to make him a partner, and he did not thrive. He left Glasgow with his wife and fellow artist Margaret Macdonald when architectural work dried up.  Neither has Mackintosh\u0026rsquos built heritage been well protected.

Somer and Areeb Umeed Bakhsh, who are 15 and 13 respectively, say they are terrified they will be killed because of their Christian beliefs.  The boys - and their parents Maqsood and Parveen - have failed to secure asylum in the UK after fleeing Pakistan six years ago.  The Bakhsh family are now seeking legal aid to appeal immigration decisions to return them to the sub-continent, where British authorities do not believe they are at risk.  Somer, who is studying five Highers at Springburn Academy in Glasgow and hopes to be an astrophysicist when he is older, said: \u0026ldquoI love Scotland and I do not want to go back to Pakistan.  \u0026ldquoThe thought of it terrifies me and it is very stressful to even imagine going back there.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot have a future and I can\u0026rsquot even read or write Urdu.  \u0026ldquoI want to live here in Scotland, it is my country and my home.

The family fled to Scotland after the murder of two Christians who were gunned down outside a court, while in police custody, in the Pakistan city of Faisalabad in July 2010.  Mr Bakhsh, an elder at Possilpark Parish Church, claims the people responsible for their deaths believe he is in league with them, know exactly who he is and would kill him and his family if they had the chance.  Paul Sweeney, MP for Glasgow North-East, said it would be \u0026ldquoinhumane to deport two teenagers, who are effectively naturalised Scottish boys.  He has urged UK Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes MP, to give the Bakhsh family permission to stay in the UK while the Home Office urgently re-examines their case.

But both have been unable to work in Scotland and forced to survive on benefits and charity due to their immigration status.  Mr Sweeney, said: \"I have met the family and was disturbed to learn that they are at risk of deportation to Pakistan where they have already faced discrimination and very real death threats for their Christian beliefs.  \"This family have already contributed a huge amount to our local community of Possilpark in Glasgow through the parish church and are exactly the sort of people that our country should be welcoming with open arms, not casting out to a dangerous future.  \"It is shocking that a highly skilled and motivated family like this have been kept in limbo for so long, unable to work or even drive a car."},{"url":null,"title":"The Mack can be restored  says Muriel Gray","story":"              THE Mackintosh building, \u0026ldquothe world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building, can be built again, the chairwoman of the Glasgow School of Art has declared.

I am not remotely pessimistic about it.  Ms Gray said that \u0026ldquothe biggest job next is to keep morale going, to roll up our shirt sleeves, and start again.But the will is there to do it.  As for the cost of reconstructing the building, she said \u0026ldquothat is ineffable at the moment. Questions have been asked about anti-fire measures at the site, but Ms Gray was adamant the board had done \u0026ldquoeverything we could to guard against a second blaze. She said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely at the top of our agenda. We were massively fire aware.  \u0026ldquoAnd we were completely re-assured that we had done everything, and appointed the correct contractors to apply absolute gold standard fire protection during the construction of one of the most valuable buildings that we have.  Ms Gray added: \u0026ldquoLast time we would be able to answer every question.We have absolutely no idea what happened this time.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos huge questions to be asked, but they are being asked by us, not only to us."},{"url":null,"title":"Our Top 10  Sneak preview of Scottish pop exhibition","story":"              FOR a small country, Scotland\u0026rsquos pop history is long and illustrious, its music scene diverse and vibrant, running from influential indie pioneers to global superstars. Now this dazzling cultural heritage is about to be celebrated in a landmark exhibition opening on Friday in Edinburgh.  Rip It Up, which runs at the National Museum of Scotland until November, is the first major exhibition of Scottish pop and explores the musical culture of the nation over the last 60 years.  Unsurprisingly, Glasgow features heavily, its musicians, scenes, venues and fans having been at the centre of so much of the action.  The exhibition showcases more than 300 objects \u0026ndash many lent by the artists \u0026ndash and brings together an unprecedented collection of costumes, memorabilia, instruments and props alongside archive footage and interviews with everyone from The Proclaimers, Franz Ferdinand, Simple Minds, Lulu, Midge Ure and Alex Harvey, to Gerry Rafferty, Annie Lennox, Young Fathers and Shirley Manson.  Delving into Scotland\u0026rsquos extraordinarily strong contributions to punk, new wave and indie, the exhibition also traces the influence of labels such as Postcard and Creation through costume, artwork and instruments, exploring the impact made by much-loved bands as diverse as Altered Images, The Skids, The Associates, Primal Scream, BMX Bandits and the Jesus and Mary Chain.  \u0026ldquoPopular music is a shared experience and a really important one in many people\u0026rsquos lives, says exhibition curator Stephen Allen. \u0026ldquoNobody has done an exhibition on Scottish pop on this scale and we want it to capture people\u0026rsquos imagination and allow them to reflect on their own experiences of listening to and enjoying music.  \u0026ldquoBetween the objects, the footage and the music, people will be able to learn more about their favourite artists and see their treasured objects up close, but also to discover music that is new to them in a whistlestop tour of over six decades of Scottish pop.  Here\u0026rsquos our top 10 objects to look out for in the exhibition.  Gerry Rafferty\u0026rsquos acoustic guitar painted by John Byrne, early 1970s.  This is one of several guitars painted by Byrne for his Paisley buddy Rafferty. He played this one, which has never been displayed before, on Top of the Pops in 1973, performing the Stealers Wheel classic Stuck in the Middle With You. The Baker Street star first came to prominence alongside Billy Connolly as part of folk band The Humblebums and went on to become a successful singer-songwriter and producer. He died in 2010 and remains one of the most talented and loved musicians of his generation.  PVC jumpsuit worn by Rezillos singer Eugene Reynolds in the band\u0026rsquos 1978 appearance on Top of the Pops.  Formed at Edinburgh College of Art in 1976, The Rezillos designed and made many of their striking stage outfits. With a distinctive high energy style, they were quickly noticed by major labels and went on to enjoy chart success. The band broke up in 1978, re-emerging as The Revillos fronted by Fay Fife and Reynolds. The Rezillos reformed in 2001 and continue to record and perform.  Original photograph of Average White Band with Marvin Gaye, 1976.  The American soul legend was one of the band\u0026rsquos idols and turned up to sing with them at a gig at the Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles. The funk and blues band from Dundee and Glasgow made their big breakthrough 1973 when they supported Eric Clapton and became hugely popular in the US, where the single Pick Up the Pieces and album AWB reached number one simultaneously in the US charts in 1974. Over the next decade they released critically acclaimed albums and successful singles, and their sound has been sampled by many other bands. They still perform today.  Annie\u0026rsquos Lennox\u0026rsquos Tartan trouser suit, made by Jeff Banks, 1983.  The suit was part of Lennox\u0026rsquos famously androgynous look, and was worn during the Eurythmics Touch tour in 1983 and 1984. Born in Aberdeen, Lennox is one of the most recognisable voices of the past 30 years. She earned a scholarship to London\u0026rsquos Royal Academy of Music at 17 and sang in new wave group The Tourists with Dave Stewart, with whom she went on to form the Eurythmics, one of the biggest bands of the 1980s.  Long-sleeved T-shirt worn by Paolo Nutini at his first T in the Park appearance in 2006.  PaOlo, from Paisley, was booked to play the T-Break stage for up-and-coming artists, but that week his first single Last Request reached the top five in the UK chart. He made a hastily arranged main stage appearance and went on to perform six times at the festival over the years, becoming a firm favourite.  Trouser suit worn by Lulu for concerts in 1969  Born Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie in Glasgow in 1948, Lulu began singing in clubs and halls whilst still at school. She came to the attention of Decca Records, which signed her with backing band The Luvvers. Lulu\u0026rsquos breakthrough hit in 1964 was a version of The Islay Brothers\u0026rsquo soul stomper Shout, after which the 5ft 1inch singer also established herself as an actor and TV star. In 1969, just after marrying Bee Gee Maurice Gibb, she won the Eurovision Song Contest. In the 1990s, she won a new generation of fans after teaming up with Take That.  Wee Red Bar poster advertising a Proclaimers concert on January 14, 1985.  Twin Brothers Craig and Charlie Reid developed their performance skills and gained a growing following by gigging regularly around Scotland, often in small venues such as the Wee Red Bar at Edinburgh College of Art. This gig was in support of the campaign against Apartheid in South Africa, and the brothers have always supported political causes.  Skirt worn by Eddi Reader in the music video for Perfect, 1988.  Eddi customised this vintage skirt she had bought in Forgotten Dreams, a second-hand shop in Glasgow, and wore it in the video for Fairground Attraction\u0026rsquos debut single, which went to number one in May 1988.  Singer-songwriter Reader began her career busking and singing backing vocals for various bands. After her stint with Fairground Attraction, as a solo artist she went on to record a number of albums, and has been feted for her versions of the poems and songs of Robert Burns.  Orange Juice poster and original artwork for the single Blue Boy by the band\u0026rsquos frontman Edwyn Collins, 1980.  The Glasgow-based band began by signing to Postcard Records, founded in the city by Alan Horne in 1979. The label famously adopted the ambitious slogan The Sound of Young Scotland, inspired by Motown Records and although only active for two years, gathered a roster of bands that included Aztec Camera, Josef K and Australian cult heroes The Go-Betweens. The label\u0026rsquos stylish tone and independent spirit continues to influence labels and bands today.  AMEK Einstein Super E mixing desk, 2001.  Record label Chemikal Underground \u0026ndash founded and run by indie band The Delgados \u0026ndash opened its first studio, Chem 19 Recording, in 1997 in Hamilton. The mixing desk featured in the exhibition was used between 2001 and 2012, with much of the label\u0026rsquos catalogue recorded there. The studio is open to hire and regularly used by artists including Arab Strap, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, King Creosote, Mogwai and The Twilight Sad.

More than 50 holes dug by people undertaking illegal metal detecting have been found at the Brunton Turret section of the 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, government heritage agency Historic England said.  Nighthawks, the term for illegal metal detectorists, have targeted the turret and well-preserved section of wall, which was built by the men of the Twentieth Legion of the Roman Army, in their search for ancient artefacts.  The ruins of the Brunton Turret section are surrounded by further buried archaeological remains from the frontier of the Roman empire, which are very vulnerable to damage from nighthawks, Historic England said.  The discovery is the latest in a spate of nighthawking incidents along the wall, at Corbridge, Housesteads and Steel Rigg, over the last three years.  All the sites are protected as scheduled monuments where using a metal detector without proper authorisation is a criminal offence.  Historic England is calling on visitors to Hadrian\u0027s Wall and Tyne Valley residents to report illegal metal detecting which is \"causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage\".  Mike Collins, Historic England\u0027s inspector of ancient monuments at Hadrian\u0027s Wall, said: \"We know that the majority of the metal-detecting community complies with the laws and regulations regarding discovery and recovery of objects from the land.  \"But the small number of people who steal artefacts and damage ancient sites are breaking the law and robbing us all of the knowledge and understanding that objects from the past can give us.  \"These nighthawks are committing a criminal offence and we\u0027d like everyone\u0027s help to ensure they are caught. Together we can protect the precious shared legacy that our archaeological sites hold.\"  Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime and policing advice for Historic England, said: \"Illegal metal detecting is not a victimless crime.  \"We may never see or fully understand the objects taken or damaged because they have been removed from their original sites with no care or record as to their history or context.\"  He added: \"Historic England will continue to work with Northumbria Police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the metal detecting community to identify the small criminal minority who are intent on causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage and to bring them to justice.\""},{"url":null,"title":"  39 Mundell  39 s position is untenable  39   says SNP Westminster leader","story":"              The SNP\u0027s protest at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions \"most certainly isn\u0027t\" a one-off, the party\u0027s Westminster leader has warned.  Ian Blackford said it would \"not be business as usual\" as he signalled the SNP\u0027s \"real determination\" to hold the Government to account over its Brexit legislation.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell\u0027s position is \"untenable\" he added, having \"failed to defend Scotland\u0027s interests\" through the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.  Mr Blackford was ordered out of the Commons chamber following a row with Speaker John Bercow during PMQs last week.  His SNP colleagues then walked out as part of their protest over what they claim is a \"power grab\" over Brexit.  Mr Blackford told the Press Association: \"Is what we did last week, is that a one-off and is that the end of it?  \"It most certainly isn\u0027t and what we do want to signal to the Government in London (is) that this will not be business as usual, our relationship with the Government, which will remain courteous, will be very different and we will seek to hold the Government to account as and when we can.  \"Now of course we\u0027re not going to signal to the Government exactly how and when we will do that, we are looking at a number of things that we can do.  \"This will be procedural, this will be what we can do around legislation, but we\u0027ll do it on the basis that we\u0027re discharging our duty to stand up for Scotland, but it\u0027ll be done in a way which is dignified, which does show respect, we will not show discourtesy.  \"But it will be absolutely crystal clear that there\u0027s a real determination that we have, and if I may say so as well that our colleagues that we work closely with in the Scottish Government have, that Westminster has to understand that we cannot accept what is taking place.\"  The UK Government has previously said the Bill delivers on its pledge to give \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  The Scottish Parliament has not granted a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation.  Mr Blackford earlier said the Government has to bring forward emergency legislation which respects devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people.  Asked if the ball was in their court, he said: \"It is, one I think the Government has got to bring forward legislation, two I think they have got to enter into talks through the joint ministerial committee with the Scottish Government but it has to be on that basis that they understand that they\u0027ve crossed the line and this is not acceptable.  \"I think on the basis of where we are at the moment, I do think that David Mundell\u0027s position is untenable.\"  Mr Blackford claimed Brexit Secretary David Davis was \"more appreciative and understanding of the position that we\u0027re taking\", adding: \"I think what the Government in London needs to have is someone that\u0027s a Secretary of State that understands the devolution settlement.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Tweet goes viral as Celtic fans go hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm","story":"              CELTIC fans have gone hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm which appears to bear\u0026nbspa resemblance to the club\u0027s badge.

The new seafood venture from Ondine Restaurant\u0026rsquos chef patron, Roy Brett and Gary Welch, owner of the famous Welch Fishmongers, is situated on Newhaven Harbour where boats have landed fish since the 16th century in part of the current fish market building.  The Edinburgh\u0026nbspeatery\u0027s signature dish is their version of the long-standing classic and describe as the \"ultimate fish and chips\", cooked fresh to order and available to sit in or take away.

The Labour leader said the Prime Minister had acknowledged the \u0026pound20.5 billion a year boost for the NHS would come from Brexit, economic growth and tax.  He asked at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions: \"There can be no Brexit dividend before 2022, economic growth is the slowest since 2009 - so which taxes are going up?\"  Mrs May said a long-term plan for the NHS had been set out, with money no longer sent to the EU available for the health service.  In response to heckles from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted Mr Corbyn saying he would \"use the funds returned after Brexit\" to invest in public services.  Mr Corbyn replied by telling the PM he said the money should be ring-fenced to replace structural funds to regions, agriculture, the fishing industry and research for universities.  He added: \"Can she be straight with people - which taxes are going up and for whom?\"  Mrs May said Chancellor Philip Hammond will set out the full funding package before the spending review.  She claimed there will be one circumstance in which there will be no money returning from the EU, telling MPs: \"That\u0027s if we adopted Labour\u0027s policy of getting a deal at whatever the price.\"  Mr Corbyn said the funding was \"less than is needed just to stand still\" as he asked why anyone would trust the Government with the NHS.  He said: \"The Prime Minister is writing IOUs just to stand still.  \"Until this Government can be straight with people where the money is coming from, why should anyone, anyone anywhere, trust them on the NHS?\"  Mr Corbyn also drew laughter from MPs as he claimed Mrs May\u0027s figures were \"so dodgy they belong on the side of a bus\".  Mrs May hit back, saying Labour\u0027s plan does not \"add up\".  \"He can stand up here all he likes and talk about the Labour Party\u0027s plans for money, but what we know is that the Labour Party\u0027s plans would bankrupt this economy, and the IFS have said Labour would not raise as much money as they claim even in the short run, let alone the long run.  \"In short, their plan absolutely doesn\u0027t add up.  \"Conservatives putting more money into the National Health Service, Labour losing control of the public finances and bankrupting Britain.\"  She said her party had \"consistently put extra money into the National Health Service\" and had announced a plan which gives the NHS \"certainty of funding for the next five years\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Sick MPs may be unable to take part in crunch Brexit vote","story":"              With Theresa May facing a knife-edge Commons vote over Brexit, Labour has accused the Conservatives of refusing to co-operate with a long-standing convention permitting sick MPs to vote.  Under the convention, MPs who are too ill to make their way through the voting lobbies can be \"nodded through\" from an ambulance or car parked in the parliamentary courtyard.  At least one Labour MP and possibly more were understood to be planning to come from hospital to be nodded through for Wednesday\u0027s crucial vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which could be decided by the narrowest of margins.  A senior Downing Street source said he was not aware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate, but a Labour spokesman confirmed the party\u0027s whips had been told \"nodding through\" would not be available, denouncing the move as \"obviously unacceptable\".  Tory rebels believe they can inflict defeat on the Government as the flagship legislation returns to the Commons after the Lords again backed giving MPs a \"meaningful\" say on the final deal.  The Prime Minister staved off a Tory rebellion on the move last week but faces a bruising battle in the latest round of voting amid claims she failed to implement a compromise that opponents believed they were promised.  Phillip Lee, who resigned as a government minister in order to back a strengthened role for Parliament, acknowledged there had been a concerted effort to win over would-be rebels, including the \"dark arts\" of persuasion in the corridors of power.  But he claimed the rebels may have the strength to defeat the Prime Minister - who he said he still counts as a friend - unless an 11th-hour concession is agreed.  Dr Lee told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \"We were always going to get the normal dark arts of Westminster taking place, fully expected, but my understanding is that the position taken by a number of colleagues is solid, which is why the Government is still in negotiations.\"  Asked if there were enough rebels to defeat the Government, he said: \"Potentially, yes. But... this for me personally is a position of integrity, that I think Parliament deserves to have a proper role in this process, a truly meaningful vote.\"  He rejected some of the claims made about the consequences of a Government defeat which would give Parliament a greater role in the event of a failure to agree a Brexit deal.  \"I cannot follow the argument, in fact I think it\u0027s nonsense, that somehow this makes it harder for the Prime Minister to do a deal in Brussels.\"  He added: \"I continue to be hopeful that the Government will accept our position but fundamentally this is not about the Government, this is about Parliament and - I would argue - this is about my country, this is about securing a Brexit deal which is good for my country in the longer term.  \"I think, in the unlikely event that Government fails to get a deal, Parliament should play a part in trying to find a solution.\"  Dominic Grieve, one of the leading figures in the stand-off, said he expected negotiations to \"go right to the wire\".  The possibility of a rebellion \"all depends on where we go on the negotiations and at the moment I don\u0027t know the answer\", the former attorney general added.  Tory Remainer Anna Soubry posted a lengthy statement about why she will rebel and denied being a \"traitor\".  \"Getting Brexit right is vital and is the most important set of decisions our country has taken in decades,\" she wrote.  \"Whatever we were told during the referendum, you can\u0027t simply unravel 43 years of membership of the EU in a year or two and getting a new trading deal is far from the \u0027simplest\u0027 of matters as we were assured.\"  Peers on Monday backed an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, tabled by Viscount Hailsham, that would require the Government to allow MPs to vote on how it would proceed in the absence of a Brexit deal by January 21 next year.  MPs will now vote on whether to adopt the motion, which was brought in after pro-EU rebels led by Mr Grieve accused the Government of reneging on measures they believed had been agreed to see off a rebellion last week.  The Prime Minister has warned against any moves to \"tie her hands\" during negotiations with Brussels, saying that Parliament must not be able to \"overturn the will of the British people\".  Under Government plans, if MPs reject the agreement reached by Mrs May with Brussels, or if no deal has been obtained by January 21, Parliament will be offered the opportunity to vote on a \"neutral motion\" stating it has considered a minister\u0027s statement on the issue.  Crucially, the motion will be unamendable, meaning MPs cannot insert a requirement for Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.  The Commons vote comes as Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, appears before MPs at hearings of the Exiting the EU and Home Affairs select committees."},{"url":null,"title":"Claims food supplements can slow Alzheimer  39 s progress are   39 irresponsible  39 ","story":"              Experts have strongly condemned \"irresponsible\" and \"deeply cynical\" claims that a new food supplement can slow the progress of Alzheimer\u0027s.  A study of 13 patients found that a combination of fish oil and eye-protective nutrients led to \"significant\" improvements in memory, sight and mood.  Trial patients who took the Memory Health supplement \"displayed overwhelmingly positive responses\", according to a press release accompanying the product\u0027s launch.  Progression of the disease was delayed and the supplement helped \"maintain cognitive abilities and quality of life\", it was claimed.  A month\u0027s supply of 30 of the capsules costs \u0026pound27.50 and is available online from www.memoryhealth.  But leading experts strongly criticised the research behind the product, calling the \"breakthrough\" claims irresponsible and warning that the findings were \"highly unlikely to be true\".  Thirteen patients with mild to advanced Alzheimer\u0027s disease were given the supplement for 18 months and their progress assessed.  Each Memory Health capsule contains a combination of macular carotenoids and fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids.  Macular carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin are plant-derived pigment compounds that are thought to protect the retina from damage.  The new approach to tackling Alzheimer\u0027s was pioneered by Dr Alan Howard, inventor of the low-calorie rapid weight loss plan the Cambridge Diet.  Dr Howard, who chairs The Howard Foundation charity that promotes nutrition research and was one of the study authors, said: \"This represents one of the most important medical advancements of the century.  \"Alzheimer\u0027s disease is the largest public health crisis the UK has ever faced, and drug companies have so far fallen at every hurdle in finding a solution.  \"This study gives us that breakthrough, in a unique natural compound of nutrients.\"  Colleague Professor John Nolan, founder of The Nutrition Research Centre Ireland (NRCI) in Waterford, where the study took place, said: \"I believe this is a valuable discovery that will challenge perceptions worldwide about the role of nutrition in brain function.\"  However, independent experts reviewing the results published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u0027s Disease were not impressed.  Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"Whilst any research in Alzheimer\u0027s disease is to be welcomed, this is too small a trial and lacks a placebo control so that its findings are highly unlikely to true.  \"In fact I would place no reliance on these results, especially since we know little effect of fish oils or carotenoid supplements on other outcomes in proper trials.\"  Professor Robert Howard, head of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, said: \"This report is sadly not much more than low-grade anecdotal evidence. Certainly, it falls seriously short of the standards of a high-quality clinical trial in terms of scale and conduct.  \"The accompanying claims made by Dr Howard seem irresponsible and completely unsupported by any reasonable reading of his data.  \"Sadly, people with dementia and their carers will grasp at any straw and I would worry about the impact of media reports around what seem either naive or deeply cynical attempts to exploit this.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at the charity Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said: \"The experimental design of this study makes it hard to draw meaningful conclusions about the effect of these supplements on the symptoms of Alzheimer\u0027s... claims about the significance of these findings should be met with caution.\"  Memory Health is licensed on a not-for-profit basis by the Howard Foundation with \u0026pound1.50 from every purchase supporting research into Alzheimer\u0027s disease."},{"url":null,"title":"How can Scotland become a world leading nation in cyber resilience ","story":"              Come the end of October 2018 the Scottish Government is set to increase the scare-factor around this side of the United Kingdom especially within Scotland\u0026rsquos public sector.

Deputy First Minister John Swinney\u0026rsquos vision is for Scotland to become a world leading nation in this field of expertise. If Scotland is to achieve this goal then its public sector must set a precedent for all others to follow. But with 60% of small businesses having been breached in the last year and with almost 40% of Scottish SMEs spending nothing on IT security* it seems that most of the public sector still need to act.  With the fears around cyber security more heightened than ever before, the Scottish Cyber Resilience scheme was developed in 2017 to lay the groundwork for minister\u0026rsquos long-term goal. The WannaCry ransomware attack of May 2017 accelerated the entire program after more than 300,000 computers were infected. Since then several requirements have been issued to those in the public sector regarding how government departments, local authorities and NHS boards can become more secure online.  While a large portion of Scottish public bodies already have cyber security measures in place, it\u0026rsquos the aim of Scottish ministers for the entire public sector to become exemplar in this field.  The following info gives an overview of cyber resilience and explains the steps the public sector should be taking:  What is Cyber Resilience?  Cyber Resilience means an all-encompassing approach that covers not only protective measures but also measures to respond and recover if you are attacked. Since cyber security is a risk management exercise, you should always be prepared for the worst to happen as there is always a margin of risk for things to creep through. That\u0026rsquos why, to cover all your bases, you need to be resilient and not just secure.  Products such as ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security best practice, and specifies the requirements for implementing an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS offers organisation-wide protection of all information in all its forms. By implementing an ISMS you would be in a position to identify risks and continue to protect against them.\u0026nbsp All leading cyber resilience programmes incorporate requirements that ISO 27001 lays out and eases the process of implementation.  How do I become compliant?  By taking the necessary steps, sooner rather than later.\u0026nbsp Steps such as confirming a Cyber Essentials pre-assessment has taken place, ensure staff have undertaken cyber resilience training, and have a cyber incident response plan, are just some of the initial actions the Scottish Government has proposed the public sector to take.  Alan Calder, the founder and executive chairman of IT Governance, one of the Scottish public sector\u0026rsquos preferred providers, says that it is critical that Scottish organisations start their compliance journey as soon as possible. \u0026nbsp  He said: \u0026ldquoCyber-crime is perhaps the single biggest threat to modern businesses and attacks are continually on the rise. The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos legislation is something that we as an industry welcome to encourage more organisations to effectively incorporate cyber resilience into their practices.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos fantastic to see is that the scheme incorporates the requirements of leading examples of cyber security such as the international information security standard ISO 27001 and the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme. That the Scottish Government has acknowledged that effective business continuity management makes up a crucial part of a comprehensive cyber resilience programme.  Where can I get support?  IT Governance has helped thousands of companies with their compliance journey\u0026rsquos including the University of Edinburgh and Glasgow city council.\u0026nbsp  The Scottish Government has listed a range of existing standards, guidelines and controls that can contribute to increased cyber resilience. IT Governance can help organisations meet compliance obligations through the implementation of an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS, business continuity management, incident response management and penetration testing.  IT Governance has recently opened a brand-new Edinburgh office to further support local organisations, and the Scottish public sector, to align their cyber resilience strategies with international best practice. The company is a specialist in ISO 27001 implementations, CREST-accredited Cyber Essentials certifications, penetration testing PCI DSS and the GDPR.

Highland \u0026amp Islands MSP David Stewart had been promoting a member\u0026rsquos bill at Holyrood on the issue in light of last year\u0026rsquos lethal blaze at Grenfell tower.  It had received overwhelming cross-party support, with more than 50 MSPs from all five parties backing it, meaning it would have advanced through parliament.  However the Scottish Government has now taken over the plan, speeding its progress, as part of a broader programme of post-Grenfell safety improvements.  Sprinklers and fire suppression systems are currently mandatory in all high-rise domestic buildings, whether private or social, with a floor more than 18 metres high.  The new measure will extend that to all new build social housing.  A recent review also recommended expanding the use of sprinkler systems in houses in multiple occupation used as care facilities or with more than 10 people.  Mr Stewart said: \u0026ldquoFire sprinklers have been proven time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.  \u0026ldquoThe strong backing for the plans from the public, industry and across the Parliamentary Chamber has been so encouraging and I am delighted that the Scottish Government have seen the sense in these proposals and have decided to take them on.  \u0026ldquoThe ball is now in the Government\u0026rsquos court to respond effectively and quickly to this overwhelming support.  \u0026ldquoI intend to work closely with the Government on the plans and will continue to campaign to ensure that this new requirement makes it onto the statue books as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoMy hope is that, as fire sprinkler technology becomes more widely used, eventually all Scottish homes will be protected by this life saving technology.  Housing minister Kevin Stewart said the government would bring forward legislation as soon as practicable in the parliamentary session.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to further improve standards in our social housing and this work will be taken forward alongside the recommendations of the two reviews of building standards and fire safety which we will consult on later this summer.  \u0026ldquoI look forward to continuing to work together with David Stewart and the very many others who have contributed to date in order to see this legislation through."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow to trial 5G mobile network","story":"              Glasgow has been named as one of seven cities to become trial areas for a 5G roll-out.  Vodafone UK will introduce the fifth generation wireless systems between October and December this year.  The mobile operator says it will form part of its investment in building a \"world-class\" network infrastructure to support Gigabit UK, where users can access ultra-fast connection speeds of one gigabit per second.  In addition to Glasgow, engineers are laying the groundwork for 5G at more than 40 sites in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Liverpool, London and Manchester.  Discussions with enterprise customers are also under way which could lead to the testing of new 5G applications such as augmented and virtual reality in offices, factories and hospitals.  The 5G trial was announced on Wednesday after Vodafone won the largest block of 5G spectrum in the recent auction.  The company says the coming trials will ensure it is ready for the commercial launch of full 5G in 2020.  Nick Jeffery, Vodafone UK chief executive said: \"We want to make 5G and new fibre broadband services available to consumers and business throughout the UK, delivering a gigabit society for all.  \"We will also be bringing ultra-fast 4G to several hundred sites in hard to reach rural areas this year, building on our position as the network that offers the best voice coverage in the UK.\"  The Gigabit UK programme also offers customers \"superior fixed broadband\" using gigabit-capable fibre connections  Seven cities - Aberdeen, Coventry, Edinburgh, Huddersfield, Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Stirling - will have access to Vodafone Gigafast Broadband towards the end of this year."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP    39 No rope strong enough  39  to hold Scotland to UK under   39 cliff edge  39  Brexit","story":"              There is \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Government pursues a \"cliff edge\" Brexit, the SNP\u0027s Europe spokesman has warned.

Tain is my home town and I care about it \u0026ndash and the same is true of the other communities that I have the honour to represent.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sailor in distress proves false alarm","story":"A lifeboat rushed into action on Friday night after a yacht was\u0026nbspreported to be in trouble in the Pentland Firth.A boat was launched from Scrabster, but on nearing the 30-foot vessel\u0026nbspthe RNLI crew ascertained that the sailor \u0026ndash on his way home to Denmark\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash was not in any danger.\u0026ldquoHe was fine, but he\u0026rsquod been struggling with the tides to get through and that was all, said Andy Pearson, the station\u0027s full time mechanic.\u0026ldquoSomebody had obviously seen him dodging through the tides trying to make his way through the Firth, and he was using his experience to get through.Pearson said that the lifeboat stayed with the man \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquoquite an old experienced sea dog \u0026ndash to make sure he negotiated the Skerries safely.\u0026ldquoSomeone filed a report with good intent and it\u0026rsquos good for us to go out and check that they are ok, he underlined.Thurso is the most northerly RNLI lifeboat station on mainland Scotland.Crews of the Scrabster station\u0026rsquos Severn class all-weather lifeboat have received 17 awards for gallantry.Pearson said that the man was not planning on stopping before sailing across the North Sea to Denmark \u0026ndash a distance of around 450 nautical miles.He stressed that any small vessel low in power should monitor what the tides are doing before they try and negotiate the Firth.\u0026nbspWednesday 20 Jun 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114264.jpg","title":"Special delivery for retiring Lybster postie","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe started in 1988, taking over from another postie who was a familiar figure to a certain generation, Donnie Bremner from Mid-Clyth.Thirty years ago Murray had to go over the Ord to Helmsdale to meet the train north to collect the mail then take it to the local sorting offices in Dunbeath and Lybster. All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 8:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04110000/04110627.jpg","title":"Wicks Bremner monument gets a facelift","story":"A MONUMENT at Wick in memory of wreck-raiser and civil engineer James Bremner has been given a facelift.\u0026nbspThe Wick Paths Group, which was instrumental in getting the work at the memorial under way, plans to place an interpretive panel at the site telling people about the work Bremner carried out.Group secretary John Bogle said: \u0026ldquoThere are a wealth of stories about James Bremner. I\u0026rsquom sure there are a lot of people who won\u0026rsquot know them.He explained that only the base of the memorial, which was erected in 1903, was still to be refurbished with the interpretation panels set to complete the whole project.The path along by the memorial is on the Wick section of the John O\u0026rsquoGroats Trail, a 147-mile route from Inverness.Mr Bogle pointed out that interpretation panels were already in place on the stretch of the trail through Wick, with one at the Trinkie. However, two existing panels are being moved to the Braehead and North Head.He said the paths were already proving popular with local people and visitors and the group is keen to provide information about the area.Mr Bogle added that the civil engineer\u0026rsquos gravestone \u0026ndash in the graveyard of Wick St Fergus Church \u0026ndash had also been tidied up recently.Wick Harbour Authority chairman Willie Watt MBE said: \u0026ldquoFor me James Bremner is one of the unsung heroes of Caithness. He is just an amazing character. Nothing was too difficult for him and he treated everybody he worked with the greatest of respect. He was a great leader and motivator.Mr Watt pointed out that one of the Wick engineer\u0026rsquos greatest achievements was the refloating of the SS Great Britain \u0026ndash the largest ship of its time \u0026ndash when she ran aground off Ireland in the 1840s.He said that Mr Bremner was sent for from Wick, along with a few of his men, when other engineers had failed in one of the biggest salvage operations of that era.James Bremner (1784-1856) was born at Stain, Keiss. He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 8:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 20, 2018 at 11:22 amDon\u0026#8217t miss out on a chance to win this brilliant prize worth £420!

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events. We all share the same vision in terms of upholding Orkney’s reputation as a quality food and drink location and we’re all very proud to be representing the islands on the national stage.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
