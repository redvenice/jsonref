Director Frank Capra based the Martinis — the impoverished Italian family to whom Bailey gives a loan to buy a house — on his own family. In the film, the Martinis are shown travelling with a goat in their car — ‘capra’ is the Italian for goatFARM GIRL FARCEDonna Reed, who plays George’s wife, Mary, was from rural Iowa. She proved her countryside credentials by milking one of the cows on the set — this won her a bet with Lionel Barrymore.In another scene she breaks a window by throwing a rock through it. Capra had employed a marksman to shoot the glass out, but Reed achieved the feat unaided.Ginger Rogers turned down the role of Mary, saying she thought the character was boring — something she lived to regret.DRUNKEN STUPORThe child actor Bobby Anderson played George Bailey as a boy in a flashback scene in which he is slapped by Bedford Falls’ drunken chemist, Mr Gower.Anderson said later that the actor in the role, H.B. Warner, really had been drunk during filming, and hit him so hard he drew blood.SPOT THE IN-JOKEHenry Travers, who plays the angel Clarence Odbody, had appeared in another movie the previous year called The Bells of St Mary’s. This is showing at the cinema that George Bailey walks past at the end of It’s A Wonderful Life.CENSORED AGAIN...In the film, banker Mr Potter embezzles $8,000 but doesn’t suffer any consequences. This was almost unheard of at the time — U.S. film censors had a rule that criminals must either be seen to be punished or to repent.BOX OFFICE FLOPThe movie cost $3.7 million to make — a vast sum at the time — but only earned $3.3 million at the box office. It secured six Oscar nominations but won only one —the Technical Achievement award. It was the repeat showings on TV that established the film’s enduring popularity and won it fans in succeeding generations.COMMUNIST FEARSIronically, given it’s a film that celebrates all the virtues of family life in small-town America, the director was accused by U.S. politicians of spreading Communist propaganda.         The movie cost $3.7 million to make — a vast sum at the time — but only earned $3.3 million at the box officeThey claimed that the bank threatening to bring down Bailey’s business was portrayed unfairly as ‘uncaring’. In the end the House of Representatives Un-American Activities Committee decided to take no action.DIRECTOR\u0027S CUTCapra, who won three Oscars as Best Director and also made such classics such as It Happened One Night, You Can’t Take it With You and Mr Smith Goes To Washington, was in no doubt about his personal favourite movie. He screened It’s a Wonderful Life for his family every Christmas holiday.THE FESTIVE FILMThe U.S. TV channel NBC shows It’s A Wonderful Life every Christmas Eve, a tradition so famous that it’s been used in a host of other movies to establish that it’s December 24. They include Gremlins, Home Alone, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, as well in TV shows like Cheers and The Sopranos."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/18/17/07419DFB000007D0-0-image-m-4_1563466486733.jpg","title":"Adorable four year old Downs syndrome high fives spectators fun run","story":" \u0027I ran with him and he kept sitting down loads, but when he got to the crowd he milked it and kept high-fiving everyone. When he got near the finish, he started sprinting and was cheering himself along too. He was properly milking the crowd. \u0027He\u0027s a little crowd pleaser and loves a good high-five. He does that\u0027s when he knows he\u0027s done something good. \u0027The attention from the crowd helped him finish. They were cheering him on as he approached the line.               Four-year-old Lincoln Fay entered the IronKids 500 metre race last weekend with  his three siblings\u0027At the end, because he\u0027d already escaped under the barrier and run to the finish line once, the commentator was shouting Our friend\u0027s back!\u0027 The heartwarming video has been viewed 15,000 times and racked up more than 600 comments, likes and shares. Ms Parsisson, a healthcare assistant, said: \u0027This is his third year, he loves it. He always does it with his twin sister, who doesn\u0027t have Down\u0027s Syndrome. You can see her in the video and she stops for him. \u0027Before the race, he jumped under the barrier and was running up and down with me chasing after him. He didn\u0027t win but I think Lincoln was impressed he\u0027d managed to outrun his sister.               Lincoln, who has Down\u0027s syndrome, high-fived as many spectators he could at the end of the run\u0027We were behind because all the different waves had gone past us - we were the last ones to come in.\u0027 She said the twins are very close and rarely apart from another - except from at school where Lulu has been placed in a different class due to her \u0027mothering\u0027 Lincoln too much. Ms Parsisson said: \u0027 They\u0027re brilliant together and Lulu really looks after him. He\u0027s had to go in a separate class to Lulu because she mothered him so much. \u0027He\u0027s not shy though and he\u0027ll engage with anyone, so when he has attention like that he takes all he can get. \u0027He\u0027s a very sociable little boy anyway and he takes to anybody. My uncle does IronMan a lot - he\u0027s done it about six times. We always go down and support it each year and that\u0027s how we got the kids into it.\u0027          He is seen high-fiving at least 16 people in the heartwarming video footage Despite being full of energy and giving the other racers a run for their money, Lincoln has had to overcome major health setbacks since he was a baby. Doctors claimed Lincoln would be years behind developmentally, yet he smashed all his milestones and even goes to a mainstream school. Aged two, he underwent major heart surgery and currently faces other problems, including difficulty swallowing, and issues with speech, but has never let it dampen his joy for life. The family have started signing together so Lincoln, who struggles with his speech, never has to miss out on the fun. Ms Parsisson said: \u0027We just don\u0027t treat him any differently because we\u0027ve got four kids - he\u0027s treated like the others. He does struggle, but not like we thought he would. \u0027At this year\u0027s sports day, he did his running race and he carried on running all the way down the field. He didn\u0027t stop until his teacher had to chase him. \u0027When he was two, he had a major heart operation too and his speech is struggling at the moment, so we\u0027re all signing with him. \u0027He\u0027s a bit slower at developing, but the mainstream school really help him with one-to-one support. It was really special to see him finish. A lot of health professionals told us he wouldn\u0027t walk until a late age but he does really well.

At one point, we feared we would be kidnapped.It turned out the men knew our itinerary from the IRGC, which had bugged our vehicle, intercepted our interpreter’s mobile phone and bribed our driver. They knew exactly who I was. So serious was the risk judged to be, in fact, that we were given police protection – not against criminals or terrorists, but against the Basij and other agencies of the Iranian state. In the end, the hardliners won and we felt obliged leave four days early.Yet I still have huge affection for the Iranian people. I’ve been back since and have now written a book about why Iran so distrusts the West and Britain in particular.         Mr Straw believes that misunderstanding the Iranian temperament will cause further problems          Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, pictured yesterday at a service of thanksgiving for former Cabinet Secretary Lord Heywood, said Britain will never be trusted by the current Iranian regime         According to Mr Straw, Iranians have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’       If we are to solve the current Gulf crisis in the Strait of Hormuz, then it is crucial to understand our shared history and why Iran today behaves as it does.The book is called The English Job, for example, because of a ubiquitous phrase in Persian – ‘it’s always an English job’ – which Iranians use when things go wrong.They have good cause to be resentful against the ‘cunning, colonial fox’, as they describe us. Iran never was a British colony but that didn’t stop us exploiting the country for treasure and power.At least our colonies got roads, sewers and railways. Quite the opposite was the case in Iran. Britain and Russia, after competing with each other for control of the country, eventually struck a deal which stopped all railway building right up until the 1920s.We bribed and cajoled Iran to do our will throughout the 19th Century and early part of the 20th Century and, if that didn’t work, we landed troops.         Mr Straw has written a book as to why Iran distrusts BritainWe invaded Iran in the First World War, helping cause a catastrophic famine in the process. In the Second World War, with the Russians, we jointly occupied the country for five years from 1941-6.We deposed a Shah in 1941 and installed his weaker, more compliant son.When the Iranian parliament waged an eight-year struggle to nationalise BP’s huge refinery and vast network of oil wells, MI6 and the CIA responded by organising a successful coup against the elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh, in August 1953.We helped prop up the Shah in the mid and late 1970s, even when it was obvious that he was losing popular support. Catastrophically so, in fact. In 1979, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in a revolution led by Ayatollah Khomeini and that, in turn, led directly to the start of the Islamic Republic of Iran.But the worst was to come in 1980, when Iraq’s newly appointed president, Saddam Hussein, decided, without any justification, to invade Iran. Millions on both sides lost their lives in the bloody war that followed.The whole of the West – America, France, the UK and Russia – backed Iraq (with only Israel, improbably, supporting Iran). For eight years, Iran was effectively alone. It managed to avoid abject defeat, but this searing experience has defined everything that has happened since and shaped the attitude of those in power today.Iran’s Supreme Leader since 1989, Ali Khamenei, never ceases to preach that the West cannot be trusted. In 1980, he came close to being assassinated by a renegade Iranian terrorist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq – once supported by Saddam and now by John Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser – and lost the use of his right arm.The single most powerful military figure in Iran is Major-General Qasem Soleimani, the man behind the Revolutionary Guards’ seizure of the British-flagged tanker. His world view, too, was forged in the crucible of the war with Saddam.It’s Khamenei and Soleimani who now call the shots, both literally and figuratively. Iran, in their view, is fighting for its very survival.Bolton calculates that by strangling Iran through sanctions, the Islamic revolutionary regime will collapse and the government, led by President Rouhani, will come begging for a deal.This approach won’t work. It is based upon a complete misunderstanding of the Iranian psyche. Already, American pressure has strengthened hardliners such as Khamenei and Soleimani and has weakened moderates like Rouhani. An often discontented population has been unified. After two centuries of humiliation, what Iran seeks above all is respect and recognition.As I know, having been involved for three years in negotiating the first phase of nuclear talks with Iran (2003-6), if Iran is shown that respect, a deal is possible.Without that, the cat and mouse game in the Gulf and continued instability in the wider Middle East will continue.We may not like the way Iran is behaving but comprehending why they do so could prove critical. The English Job: Understanding Iran, And Why It Distrusts Britain, by Jack Straw, Biteback, £20. "},{"url":null,"title":"German tourists ordered leave Venice brewing coffee foot famous Rialto bridge","story":"Share this article The holidaymakers were marched to a police station after a local resident reported them to the authorities, the city council said.It was the 40th time the rules have resulted in tourists being ordered to leave town since they were brought in May, it said.\u0027Venice must be respected, and bad-mannered people who think they can come here and do what they want must understand that, thanks to local police, they will be caught, punished and expelled,\u0027 Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said.

Among items for sale are François-Xavier’s famous sheep in epoxy and wool, an elephant side table, monkey lamps and a 6ft rabbit in patinated bronze. The auctioneers will not give inidual price estimates for the lots.Les Lalanne, as they were known, lived and worked at a rambling property at Ury, near Fontainebleau, creating their surreal parallel universe of functional fauna and flora. French president Emmanuel Macron described it as a mix of the “dreamlike madness of fairytales and the sublime disorder of nature”.Florent Jeanniard, the Sotheby’s expert cataloguing the sale, says it is the first time the couple’s personal collection has come up for auction. “These are not just works seen in galleries and exhibitions but pieces that were in their home and part of their daily lives,” Jeanniard told the Observer. “As they lived with these objects, I think we can safely say they were, of all their works, the ones they preferred.”The lots – 200 of them by Les Lalanne – are expected to fetch up to €22m (£19.7m). Pre-auction public exhibitions will be held from 3-6 October in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris.Les Lalanne met in 1952 at a gallery show of François-Xavier’s paintings. At the time, he rented a studio flat next to the Romanian-born sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, who would visit with bottles of vodka and cartons of Sobranie cigarettes, and who introduced him to Max Ernst, Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp.After the couple moved in together, François-Xavier swapped painting for sculpture. It was the start of a partnership that lasted more than half a century, though they created separately and collaborated on only a handful of works.Their first joint exhibition in 1964 was a disappointment. Abstract art was à la mode, with an emphasis on the aesthetic not functional. Critics were not impressed. “Those who criticised our work said it was ‘grotesque’ because they felt sculpture should not serve any other purpose that to be looked at. The idea of sculptures that had a use was a complete nonsense,” Claude said afterwards.Popular acclaim eluded them but the couple gained a following among collectors, celebrities and fellow artists, including Magritte and Picasso.In 1966, François-Xavier sent a “herd” of 24 bronze and wool sheep that would soon become his trademark to the Salon de la Jeune Peinture in Paris. They attracted the attention of art collectors and celebrities, including Saint-Laurent and his partner Pierre Bergé. YSL commissioned a series of 15 intricate Claude Lalanne mirrors for his studio and asked her to make moulds of the body of his model and muse Veruschka – born Countess Vera von Lehndorff – that were used in his 1969 autumnwinter collection.At Ury, the farmhouse, studios and garden are packed with Lalanne creations. Visitors are confronted by a huge rabbit with windblown ears, hooves for feet and a bird tail. A bronze cat with an elongated body and what appears to be a fishtail, opens to become a bar. There are cabbages on legs, and sheep sculptures graze in the courtyard.Today, a Lalanne work can reach up to 10 times its catalogue estimate at auction. (The Windsor Castle grasshopper has been moved due to renovations, but a spokesperson said it was still part of the duke’s “private collection”.)“There was always a small circle, an exclusive circle, including Saint-Laurent, Bergé, the Rothschilds, people who knew about art as well as collectors interested in their work, even if they weren’t known to the wider public,” Jeanniard said.This latest auction has raised eyebrows in France, where there are mutterings about the couple’s private collection being sold instead of being transformed into a museum or art foundation. Jeanniard dismissed the criticism. He said the Lalannes’ four daughters had been forced to sell the works to pay death duties.“To my knowledge, nobody from the French state has approached them with another solution, so they have no choice. That’s the system in France,” he said. “Besides, instead of being proud and saying how wonderful that these French artists are getting worldwide recognition, there is criticism. It’s very Paris, very French.”He added: “These works are extremely poetic, surreal and more and more universal. Like Egyptian or Greek art, they are a continuation of a certain classicism. It’s art that is universal and speaks to the whole world.”As he toured the Ury house and studios, Jeanniard was asked what was his favourite Lalanne creation. “All of it,” he said, without hesitation. “The whole collection.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a9a775753fe3d4963d01187665bc13ee1b784b/252_0_1425_855/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43ab0c24e39c9ac7eb5246197d05fb58","title":"the pioneering female photographer ida wyman in pictures","story":"The US documentarian has died aged 93.

Later that evening, PNG police visited his hotel room to tell him he was being deported from the country.“I just walked up the public road to the East Lorengau transit centre and just politely asked to go in,” he said. “The immigration guy at the gates asked for my passport, I gave it to him. He said ‘Ok you can go now, but I’m keeping your passport’. So I said I wasn’t going anywhere until I got my passport back.“He did give me my passport back. We left. Five or 10 minutes later we were just walking down the main road in Lorengau and got bailed up by four heavily armed police officers and instructed to get in the vehicle.“They said: ‘We are deporting you’. I said I think you will need to make it more official than that. Later that night they came and instructed me to leave Manus and PNG.”McKim told reporters in Hobart on his return on Saturday that things were “worse than it has ever been” on the island.“And that’s because they’ve lost hope for the future,” he said.He said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, could “simply agree with Jacinda Ardern” – who visited Australia on Thursday – that the refugees should be resettled in New Zealand.“Ms Ardern has made it abundantly clear that her offer remains … He could bring an end to six years of human misery.”On Friday, PNG’s chief migration officer, Solomon Kantha, said McKim “failed to request access to the centre through the appropriate channels” and lacked “appropriate authorisation”.McKim said this statement was “riddled with inaccuracies”.“They said I demanded to enter, I made no such demands. I simply stood on a public street and asked politely.“They said I hadn’t gone through proper channels. Well I actually emailed their chief migration officer a few days ago, and formally asked permission to enter and never heard back.“But the issue is not me, the issue is these guys have been imprisoned illegally for so many years and treated so badly. And we have a prime minister who with a stroke of a pen could end this torture.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b22dca01bbed23406da4c45c1e9c538de38be7b9/0_481_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dd1db6ea0ac7819fece87043cd6d025","title":"six years and i didnt achieve anything inside manus a tropical purgatory","story":"As 200 men enter their seventh year in limbo, Australia’s offshore detention experiment is winding down. But the loose ends left behind are devastatingby  Helen Davidson on Manus IslandFor six years Shamindan Kanapathi has been lying to his parents.Since 2013 the Sri Lankan refugee has been telling his mother and father he successfully made it to Australia and resettled safely in a new life. Only his siblings know that the 28-year-old has spent the entire time detained on Manus Island.“They feel really sorry for me, and it’s very hard when I speak to them they keep asking what’s happening. They ask about my future.”Kanapathi is not alone. There are several refugees in Papua New Guinea maintaining the heartbreaking lie.Omar Jack was 18 when Australia sent him to Manus Island in 2013, after he fled the Darfur region of Sudan.“I don’t tell them because I’m sure if I tell my mum about what’s going on, she will never be OK. You know, mum’s mum,” he says.Jack is also burdened by the fact that he, the eldest son, fled Sudan with the plan to bring his family out to join him when he got to Australia.“Maybe I will tell them one day, but not at this stage,” he says. “But it’s been six years and I didn’t achieve anything, not even for myself, forget about my family.”Jack and Kanapathi are among the fewer than 140 refugee men still on Manus Island, detained under Australia’s offshore processing regime under which thousands were sent to Papua New Guinea and Nauru in a bid to deter people from seeking asylum in Australia by boat.Now entering its seventh year, Australia’s greatest modern controversy is winding down, but the loose ends left behind are devastating.

PNG police say they will\u0026nbspcharge him with arson and attempted suicide.“This place is not like other communities, Manus Island has been isolated for a long time, so it’s hard for them to accept someone coming from the outside,” Kanapathi says.The refugees say most people are kind to them but also describe drunken abuse and violence at the hands of locals who are jealous of the Australia-funded housing, food and healthcare, off limits to them.“Someone always tells me what time I go to eat, what time I get my tablet, someone has to decide everything for me – it’s not a freedom,” Kanapathi says.“Even if you’re in Australia … if you don’t have your rights it is going to be hell for you.”When  Australia visits Lorengau, the mornings begin with torrential rain, soaking the wide empty streets around the central market where mostly women sell fresh produce, fish and nuts. Huge sea turtles, stripped of their shells, are spread on the grass. People pick their way around puddles and flooded drains, sit under the eaves talking or chewing betel nut.Asked what they think of the project, many shrug.Manusians are doing what they can to tolerate and adapt, to take the jobs not filled by hundreds of Australians, to hold on to their island culture while welcoming people from very different ones.In the market a couple of refugees stop to talk near the entrance to the fish section. A PNG man asks them to move with an air of weary tolerance.The men apologise, shift over and continue their discussion of who has left Manus recently, doing a quick headcount. Some share recent stories of locals threatening black magic against them, or of a recent rejection for US resettlement.Most of the men stay inside their rooms, sometimes for up to six days at a time, some eating just once a day, because if you eat more than that you have to find something to do with your energy, and there is nothing to do.At a small supermarket a young Afghan man sits on the edge of a fridge. He’s waiting for his friend and watching the late afternoon traffic of people shopping. He was rejected for US resettlement a few years ago and now there is nothing but the daily pattern of life. Everything is the same here, he says. It doesn’t change. Entering his seventh year on Manus Island, he says it’s been too long, but he sounds resigned.It has been too long for everyone in Lorengau, the town without choice.Locals talk of the days it began: with the Australian army and navy brought in to their remote town, intimidating most people from asking any questions.Then the refugees began arriving from Christmas Island, taken off boats intercepted on their way from Indonesia to seek asylum in Australia. At peak there were more than 2,000 incarcerated inside the purpose-built facility inside the Lombrum naval base, a short boat ride around the nearest headland.An epidemic of tragedy followed: mental illness, self-harm, suicides, murder, assaults and mass hunger strikes.Then in late 2017, after a brutal 24-day standoff brought the centre to a close, the men were moved closer to town and given more freedom to walk around.They live in three compounds – East Lorengau transit centre, Hillside Haus, and West Lorengau. Each is on the outskirts of town, down long dirt roads leading into thick jungle, the entrances to the centres manned by Paladin guards.They accept no visitors, and the refugees must abide by a 6pm to 6am curfew. If they want to find work, or organise travel, they must go through JDA Wokman, the logistics contractor.As numbers dwindle due to medevac transfers, Port Moresby transfers and US resettlement, authorities appear to be consolidating people into East Lorengau.Some who refused to take part in the refugee process in the early years were given negative determinations as a result, and now beg to have their claims assessed so they can apply for US resettlement.As they did while in detention, men have formed their own communities based on their homeland.“We love each other, we support each other,” Jack says. “Each one of us has a community and the community is our family. Sadness and happiness we are all together.”They are also supported by a network of advocates in Australia, mostly older women who some of the men affectionately refer to as “grandmothers”.Ben Pokarup is a burly local man from an outer island, who has helped the refugees however he can over the years.“In Manus, I think, a lot of people are full of hospitality and they sympathise with them,” he says outside his home, a traditional men’s hut just outside town.But Pokarup says he also has concerns, including for the welfare of local women who forged relationships with some of the refugee men, had children, and are now alone.“The fabric of our Manus society was also absolutely destroyed because of these connections,” he says.Hugely controversial contracts, paid by the Australian government, have also caused great ision. Pokarup says Australians get paid as much as 10 times what a local earns working for a company which takes its profits back to Australia.“Because of the economic downturn of the country as a whole, the furthest islands of PNG – as I think we are – live with a lot of disadvantage,” Pokarup says.“We have no other economic activity, and when Australia leaves Manus, there is hardly any tangible infrastructure left behind.”Pokarup is also chairman of the Manus tourism board. He says the region’s reputation was destroyed in an instant, but he hopes people will come to visit again soon.“I don’t think our leaders were in the right frame of mind when the project came,” he says. “They shut their mouths up, and the actions Australia took were a new colonialist approach, and made some of us … I don’t know what to say, angry or sad.”Healthcare is a lightning rod for the concerns of people like Pokarup. Australia has funded a clinic, run by Pacific International Hospital, exclusively for the refugees. But it operates only in business hours and is frequently accused of abrogating its duty of care, shunting patients to the Lorengau hospital.“I actually confronted the PIH doctors when two or three of our guys were up at the hospital,” says Pokarup, referring to some refugees.Lorengau’s hospital is grim. Perched at the top of a hill, it is a series of worn-down, brightly painted weatherboard buildings connected by covered walkways.Hand-painted signs label the dentistry, operating theatre, dispensary and emergency rooms. The emergency department has four cupboard-sized stalls separated by thin walls and doorways covered by curtains. Every one is occupied, and people sit outside, under the covered balcony, some attached to drip stands.What this place could have done with the $2m a month Australia has given PIH.“They have their own problems to look after and you see the conditions,” says Kanapathi. “The Australian government should have paid that money to the local hospital and built it up, so it would be fit for the refugees and the local people.”A sign on the outskirts of Lorengau proclaims the town as “the pride of Manus” and the first listed quality is “a healthy mind”.Last month the number of suicide attempts and acts of self-harm since the shock Australian election result reached 100. A young man set himself on fire inside his room at asylum seeker accomodation, prompting the local police to announce he would be charged with arson and attempted suicide.A national PNG newspaper published a reader’s letter decrying that all this self-harm was affecting their children, so if refugees wanted to set themselves on fire, PNG could help them burn. It’s quieter now in Lorengau, and the acts of self-harm have slowed.There is a wary calm among the people from very different backgrounds, thrown together through no choice of their own, but no one – refugees and locals alike – knows why these men are still here.On Friday the PNG prime minister, James Marape, demanded a timeline from Australia to end the regime “as soon as possible”.Had Labor won the election and followed through on its pledge to accept New Zealand’s offer to resettle refugees, it could have been over within a year or two.“Now … it’s over. It’s so so sad a story. Really, when I look at the refugees, I feel deeply sad when they share their stories with journalists. We’ve done this a million times. A million times.”Kanapathi and two fellow Sri Lankan refugees want people to know they don’t want to come to Australia.Kanapathi says he would happily agree never to come to Australia if he was allowed to go to New Zealand.“Every Australian must understand that no refugee came to Australia thinking Australia is heaven,” he says. “They just want to get away from their problems and they need a safe place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f54aab84d37185e4b7647ab457bf9a45bd3473d/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020fec2a396235e5c4fec5dc35b9039b","title":"moon best books about earths satellite","story":"Fifty years since Apollo 11 landed, the novelist shares her favourite books and poems about Earth’s mysterious satelliteThere she is, 239,000 miles from Earth. A lover’s moon, a poet’s moon, a painted moon, made of green cheese, home to the Man in the Moon, visible above the lights of Moscow and Manhattan, Tokyo and London. Hanging as the silent  of rivers and woods. Symbol of the mystery of the universe.None of this has changed since Apollo 11 landed on that broken silent surface 50 years ago. The moon is just as familiar and just as remote. The mythical and magical moon, the lunatic moon that drives men mad, Earth’s moon, lifting tides and raising sap.Ted Hughes’s poem “Full Moon and Little Frieda” is one of my favourite moon poems – everyone knows the moment of amazement and delight when we see the moon rise. I live in the countryside, and go to watch the moon come up over the wood behind my house. I know what it is, and why it is, but still it moves me and calms me.Alice Oswald’s A Sleepwalk on the Severn is perfect in its mooniness. The moon in this poem is changeable – even to herself – and dreamy as she wanders asleep among the mudflats. She is Shakespeare’s inconstant moon that lights the lovers on the balcony in Romeo and Juliet. This is the moon as part of our nightly imagination.Poets have always loved the moon, and it was Sappho who first called the moon silver. The moon is Earth’s satellite – which is why she can’t be a planet, and as she doesn’t generate her own light, she isn’t a star. But there is nothing passive about her. She stops the Earth wobbling too much as we spin. It’s called obliquity. The moon steadies us. Literally. And if you plant your vegetables using a moon calendar (yes I do) the results are surprising.Earth and the moon work as a pair an Earth-moon system. If you were standing on Mars, it would look as though they were twins, side by side, one blue, one white. This cosmic closeness was picked up by Italo Calvino in his wonderful story “The Distance of the Moon”. He imagines a time when Earth and moon were so close that their inhabitants had relationships with one another, until gradually distance began to separate us, and now we gaze forlornly at our far-away loves.There is some science behind this beautiful sad idea – it may be that the moon is a huge chunk of Earth that broke off, as the space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock explains in The Sky at Night: The Book of the Moon. It’s a book for children and adults alike, the kind of thing that makes you marvel about both our solar system and our nearest neighbour.Ronald Hutton tells a different story in his history of modern pagan witchcraft, The Triumph of the Moon. This is the moon of women, wild things, the night, the triple goddess. It is a scholarly book, and fascinating if you seek to understand the moon as magical, as symbolic, as more than a satellite in space, as a living emblem in the vast space of our imaginations.And everyone everywhere should read HG Wells’s The First Men in the Moon and Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon. Take them on holiday this summer of the moon.• Jeanette Winterson’s Frankissstein is published by Jonathan Cape.

Do the latest reforms represent progress – or a PR exercise?At the Luna food factory on the south-east outskirts of Jeddah, Mashael Elghamdi sits at her computer in an artfully ripped ACDC T-shirt and jeans. The faint whirr of machines processing cans of beans, cream and evaporated milk can be heard over the sound of eight women typing and sometimes laughing. A screensaver of a smiling Cameron Diaz gazes out from one corner of the room. This is an all-female office. And because there is no need for the full-length abayas women are legally required to wear when interacting with men at work or in public, it is a riot of colour.On the factory floor below, women in custom-made overalls on an all-female production line apply labels to cans. “All the women you see here do everything themselves,” says supervisor Fatima Albasisi, who oversees 90 workers. A staircase and a corridor separate the female factory workers from their male counterparts, while the men-only offices are in a different building. “If there’s a problem with the machines, they can fix it,” Albasisi adds. “If I could, I’d have a factory entirely run by women, no men at all. In my experience, women show up to work on time and make fewer mistakes.”The Luna food factory has been segregated since women began working as administrators here eight years ago. On the factory floor, the first 40 women started in 2013. “We work harder than the men,” Elghamdi tells me, back in the office. “For me, it’s better to be separate. If we work with the men, I have to wear my abaya and my niqab – it’s less comfortable.” She works in data entry, but also oversees worker safety for women. “It’s easier for them to tell me what they need,” she says. “It’s hard to go to the men.”Not all offices or factories in Saudi Arabia are gender-segregated it hasn’t been a legal requirement since 2005. But many employers continue to separate the sexes, to balance the conservative values of a majority-male workforce with the country’s apparent desire to get more women into work. As the physical barriers come down in other social settings, women-only workspaces are a symbol of both the future and the past the question of whether they are a necessary step towards full female participation remains a murky one.Saudi law specifies that women may work only in “fields suitable to their nature” and prohibits them from jobs considered “detrimental to health” or “likely to expose women to specific risks”. In practice, these opaque rules are often interpreted by employers as a means of banning women from anything physically challenging. (At the Luna factory, tasks such as moving heavy boxes are restricted to the men’s section.) A Women in the Workplace initiative, launched in January, requires that women be given separate spaces to work if they ask for them prevents women from being left alone with male colleagues and mandates that women can work as cleaners or in room service only at all-female hotels or resorts.If Saudi officials are to be believed, greater reforms are on the horizon. Recent changes – such as repealing a ban on women driving – are intended to signify the kingdom’s readiness to modernise. A 2016 directive also cut the power of the religious police, the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, who once watched over women’s behaviour in public: they are now unable to arrest women for crimes such as mixing with men who are not family members, or to berate them for showing their bare hands. The contrasts can be jarring: a Nicki Minaj concert originally scheduled for this month in Jeddah drew the ire of Saudi women, angry at Minaj being able to perform – “to go and shake her ass… and then you tell me to go and wear the abaya”, one Saudi woman said in a video posted to Twitter, viewed more than 37,000 times. Minaj has since cancelled her appearance, citing her support “for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression”.For Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir to the throne and de facto ruler, known as MBS, women’s participation is the embodiment of a new Saudi Arabia. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, and the subsequent cover-up, may have combusted much of the kingdom’s carefully crafted image on the international stage. But MBS remains powerful, despite the CIA’s assessment that he personally ordered Khashoggi’s killing. His mantra of change filters down from on high everyone I speak to, from street vendors to government officials, tells me, “Things are different now.” They may not always be speaking freely – a female minder accompanies me on official appointments.Long before Khashoggi’s murder, there were brutal efforts to silence critics or anyone pushing for deeper reforms. According to Amnesty International, 104 people have been executed this year. The kingdom has conducted “an unprecedented crackdown on the women’s rights movement”, Human Rights Watch says – last year arresting and prosecuting 11 women who pushed for the right to drive before it was legal, or simply spoke out against laws restricting women. According to human rights groups and their families, the women were subjected to brutal torture, including waterboarding and electric shocks. Seven have been bailed this year all await sentencing for “coordinated activity to undermine the security, stability and social peace of the kingdom”.Against this background, women-only spaces are a powerful visual signifier of change, positioning women as symbols of the new Saudi Arabia. But what do they mean to the women themselves, caught between the state’s promises and their own daily struggles to navigate a conservative society?An hour north of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast, diggers churn the sandy earth on a flat, barren plain beneath an unforgiving midday sun. There is little more to see than the sparkling turquoise-tinted glass of an empty administrative office, but the site is touted as the future of female employment in the kingdom, an “oasis” designed for women. The complex will include 48 factories producing medical supplies, food and technology.By the time construction had begun near the more progressive city of Jeddah, the government rhetoric around women’s rights and “privacy” had shifted. The Jeddah “oasis” will be “an environment that will encourage women to work”, but one where men will also be permitted, says Bandar Al-Toaimi, Modon’s communications director, gesturing at the open space as we tour the site. He says any decisions about features that could attract female workers, such as segregation, are “up to the ministry of labour’s rules and regulations”. Have any women been consulted about the design? Toaimi says he will check with the project department, but does not respond to follow-up emails. After months of detailed negotiations about my visit, I expected to see a 5 million sq m site, the foundation of a metropolis. But the complex is little more than a network of roads connecting piles of sand.Toaimi argues that the industrial park will be “a big enabler in the recruitment of females in Saudi Arabia”, as our four-wheel drive speeds along freshly built roads. Like al-Ahsa oasis, the Jeddah complex will feature a nursery and, potentially, a bus to help women get to work – though Toaimi adds dismissively that “transportation now is not an issue – women can drive”. Exactly how many isn’t clear: I fail to spot any female drivers in Riyadh or Jeddah when I visit, although a few women tell me they have obtained their licences and are cautiously starting to drive. In the months that follow, Saudi women say driving is starting to become the norm.Toaimi is upbeat about international investment but light on the details as he points out a cluster of shuttered grey factories around empty parking spaces. “We will give incentives to encourage investors to come – and ensure they have a good number of women working there. Maybe even a full facility,” he says.The global trend for women-only spaces such as the US co-working startup the Wing, which recently expanded to London, women-only train carriages in Japan and a networking retreat in Finland might sometimes create a sense that the world is catching up with Saudi Arabia. But while gender-segregated offices proliferate there, few can claim to be founded by women for women. In the offices of SheWorks, Riyadh’s sole women-only co-working space, women work on business plans from hot pink office chairs, or perch on mauve sofas, bright against the dusty cityscape outside. If men visit for meetings or training sessions, they enter via a separate door to one of the walled-off meeting rooms behind frosted windows. The office sits atop a nursery, where women can leave their children while they work. “I picked this building specifically because there is daycare downstairs,” says founder Maha Shirah, who opened SheWorks in late 2014.“There’s sort of a club vibe to it,” Shirah says of the space, looking at a nearby group clustered round a laptop. She adds that SheWorks hinges on the professional networks women build there, choosing to segregate themselves rather than being told to. “I decided to make this a women-only space because my customers wanted that,” she says, adding that she would change it if they wanted to admit men. SheWorks offers a relaxed environment where women can remove their abayas.Shirah scoffs at the promises of privacy or protection that often accompany gender-segregated workplaces. “I don’t want privacy to be forced on me,” she says. “It’s just like when you force me not to drive. No, I want to have the option. And this is what all women want in the world.”But women creating spaces to suit their own needs depends on increasing the number of female architects, a challenge in a country where women were prevented from studying the subject for decades, until 2011. Even now, “a lot of women graduating in architecture or interior design don’t have jobs,” says Haifa Al-Hababi, assistant professor of architecture at Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. Al-Hababi estimates that up to 15 women have government architecture positions, which she hopes will help increase wages and participation across the industry. She is positive about the knock-on effects of the recent reforms. “Before, you couldn’t spot any women walking along the street,” she says. “If you saw this, you’d have thought you were dreaming. Now, you see a lot of women using public space.”Gender segregation took hold in Saudi Arabia as part of a wave of conservatism that spread across the Middle East in the 80s, after Iran’s Islamic revolution. For many, separation begins at a young age: all public schools are single sex, as are many universities, some of which beam lectures given by male professors into halls of female students by video link, or keep female students apart from their male peers on a mezzanine floor.Saudi women are still legally classified as minors for their entire lives, under ship system that entitles their husband or male relative to make decisions about matters such as travel on their behalf. Recent reforms mean women no longer need a ’s permission to start a business or open a bank account. In public places, the partitions that separate “families” from “singles” (meaning men) are slowly going out of style. But decades of tradition are not easily swept away. This remains one of the most segregated societies in the world, with strict norms on gender conformity. The law bans men from “behaving like women” and it is illegal to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. At Kore gym in Riyadh, designed by a female architect and entirely operated by women since it opened last year, women train on fearsome-looking machines or crawl on the floor with bands across their legs as part of the “workout of the day”. In one corner, 18-year-old weightlifter Shirah Abdullah gulps water and chats with a friend between reps of lifting 200lb barbells. Asked what draws her to the space, she grins and says: “The community – it’s amazing here.”Kore is one of a growing number of gyms for women made possible by a change in licensing laws – a rebuke to an earlier crackdown enacted by clerics who claimed that gyms would encourage women to leave their families. The owners of Kore say several new branches are planned. But this is not without risk the Saudi General Sports Authority closed one such gym this year, claiming that a video on social media showing a woman exercising in tight sportswear was “promoting the gym disgracefully and breaching the kingdom’s code of conduct”.The women-only basement of the Panorama mall in Riyadh stands deserted, with unlit window displays of pale lace ballgowns and wedding dresses in an empty space tinted soft pink by neon lights. The ministry of labour has identified retail as a target sector for increased female employment, but this part of the mall will soon make way for a cinema, another symbol of the new Saudi Arabia. The upstairs mall – now mixed gender – will remain.Some women will miss segregation. Shop assistant Hanadi Faraj, rearranging gowns inside a friend’s boutique, tells me, “I don’t like working around men – I feel shy.” At the mall’s entrance, women wait for taxis next to a large mural merging MBS’s face with that of his father, King Salman. “I prefer women only,” says Yara Alfantoukh, a customer waiting outside with her mother. “It means I have more freedom.”Other young women prefer to navigate the challenges of gender integration. “The problem is, a lot of people have never been in a mixed environment,” says physics student Nouf Jaber, 22, who is reading a Haruki Murakami novel on the grass outside a public library in Riyadh. She points out that Saudi Arabia introduced a new anti-harassment law in May, but women still have to battle a conservative culture to report problems. “It’s one thing at work, where there’s more respect – it’s another thing for people on the street,” Jaber says. “On the street, people aren’t afraid for their jobs.” Yet she is hopeful of a future without public segregation. “I don’t feel we should be separated in restaurants or malls – that’s what caused this problem in the first place,” she says. “Suddenly they removed the barriers and no one knows what to do – I met guys who were so nervous around women that they couldn’t speak.”Jaber is considering job options for when she graduates, and recently visited the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, where she saw no women in the building. “They told me they are starting to initiate female employment,” she says. “But it’s all just talk.”One thing is certain: while the world of women’s work is evolving, public spaces are still dominated by men. As I leave a restaurant in Riyadh one evening, a large four-wheel drive pulls up next to me. “You must wear the hijab – cover your hair! Cover your hair!” a man roars, his voice filled with rage. The logo of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice is emblazoned on the car door. The officer looks over again in disgust, and drives away.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4844ef9c33fb0a90c9279d6af4c34a877f6351/741_828_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f151201598cf33bd1406845c2ef666be","title":"tell us about your favourite canal boat shop","story":"There are more licensed boats using Britain’s canals than at the height of the industrial revolution – and barge-based businesses are booming too.

Not only did Wilde and Beckett go to school here, but Brian Friel was born up the road, Seamus Heaney not too far away, same with Patrick Kavanagh, WB Yeats grew up in Sligo… It’s the epicentre of an amazing concentration of writing talent. Seán thought it would be wonderful place to hold a festival. Local people put him on to me and I was enthusiastic from the get-go.The inaugural festival was in 2012. How has it evolved?It got off to a cracking start because we got decent funding and brought in powerful international artists. People were fascinated to see where Beckett spent his formative years. These landscapes influenced him hugely. He spent a lot of time swimming in the lakes and excelled at sport here.Beckett was actually quite a cricketer, wasn’t he?Yes, he’s the only Nobel laureate to appear in Wisden. But not the only Irishman to be great at cricket, as Eoin Morgan proved last week.Has the festival been good for the town?It’s a two-way street: Enniskillen has done well out of visitors and locals have had their hometown opened up to them. We don’t have many purpose-built venues, so Seán puts on events in unusual spaces. You may never have seen inside the Methodist church, but during the festival, you can go in and listen to a fabulous string quartet play Schubert, Beckett’s favourite composer. It’s broken down barriers.Coming back must be a trip down memory lane?Very much so. It also saves me explaining why I’m here. People go: “Back for the festival?” I say “Yep”, and that bit’s done. It saves 20 minutes of small talk. As a kid, I remember being inspired by touring companies coming here to put on plays and meeting the actors around town. That’s when I realised this could be a profession. That point of contact for young creative people in any town is really important. They might experience something life-changing. The arts don’t care what your background is. They belong to everyone.Would you like to do more directing?The variety of switching disciplines is interesting, but I have to be careful. When something like Line of Duty happens, your profile is such that you’re asked to do different things. I’m careful not to spread myself too thinly or it just goes mad.Were you as relieved as the rest of us that Hastings wasn’t unmasked as corrupt kingpin “H” in Line of Duty’s latest series?Absolutely. Someone came up to me the other day and said: “You don’t realise how invested I was in you.” It’s extraordinary. But people had better watch out – it’s written by Jed Mercurio, so anything could happen. He’s killed off all kinds of Bafta-winners! At a time when people are finding it difficult to put their trust in anything, they thought: “If Ted’s corrupt, that’s the end.” People on Twitter were saying Ted should go in and sort out Brexit. He represents clarity, and there’s comfort in that. I’ll have to write The Thoughts of Chairman Ted. A little blue book.He’s beloved for his catchphrases. Does Jed Mercurio write them all or do you contribute?Sometimes they’re in Jed’s scripts, other times I’ll chuck something in. If we’re doing a Q\u0026ampA in Belfast, we might ask the audience to jot down a few suggestions. “I didn’t float up the Lagan in a bubble” came from one of those. “Now we’re sucking diesel” was mine. There was this crazy drinking game going around too. If I said “fella”, you had to take a gulp. If I said “mother of God”, down a whole pint. If I said “sucking diesel”, drink a whisky. By the end of the episode, there must have been blokes falling about all over the place.You’ve formed a close friendship with castmates Vicky McClure and Martin Compston. Is it true you’re the resident cook?That’s right. We stay in adjoining apartments during shooting and I’ll rustle up bowls of pasta or fry-ups. We learn our lines in Vicky’s flat. If there’s any late-night partying, that’s at Martin’s.Are you one of those actors who don’t like watching themselves on screen?I only tend to watch the bits I wasn’t in. I’ll watch Line of Duty to see what Martin and Vicky got up to while I was stuck at the AC-12 office.Do you have any dream roles you’d like to play?I’d love to do something funny. Our work often deals with tough subjects. You do your research and it can be quite dark. So after all these years of drama, I’d like to go to work someday with the sole intention of making people laugh.You turn 61 in a fortnight. How do your 60s feel?I’m just enjoying still being able to walk up a flight of stairs, so I count my blessings. Although a bit of grunting has started when I get up from a chair.What makes you happy when you’re not working?I would say going to watch Arsenal, but that’s not the enjoyable experience it used to be. Gardening, cooking, going for a pint with my mates – just the ordinary stuff.What’s up next for you?I’m currently in Dublin shooting the second series of Blood, a TV drama by a great writer called Sophie Petzal. It airs on Virgin Media here in the Republic and did big numbers for Channel 5 in the UK, so that’s exciting. This autumn I’m making a documentary about Beckett for BBC Four. And in February, we start on Line of Duty series six. Let’s see what Mr Mercurio comes up with this time…"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/548579d795ffcf95b321a07726aafee9fff16426/0_129_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e1fd3a68dfddf44eebb59769b5705f","title":"trevor horn webchat post your questions now","story":"The 80s hitmaker and creative force behind the Buggles, the Art of Noise and many others will be answering your questions at 1pm BST on 23 JulyHe’s credited as the man who invented the 80s – or at least its sound, thanks to his early acquisition of a Fairlight sampler and a LinnDrum machine. Whoever else might lay claim to that title, Trevor Horn certainly predicted pop’s most visual era as half of the Buggles, with their massive 1979 hit Video Killed the Radio Star, and then capitalised on it in the decade to come. He collaborated with that great pop showman, Malcolm McLaren, cofounded the ZTT label and brought the world Frankie Goes to Hollywood, with their indelible imagery and pristine knack for controversy.His work that decade is a murderers’ row of hits: ABC’s The Look of Love, Grace Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm, Godley \u0026amp Creme’s Cry, Pet Shop Boys’ Left to My Own Devices. He might as well have been the guy who invented the 90s, too: as part of the Art of Noise from 1983, Horn pioneered the sampling technology that would change the sound and scope of hip-hop in the years to come.His success continued through the 90s – Horn was behind Seal’s eponymous debut album – and into unexpected places in the early 2000s: ersatz Russian lesbians tATu’s English market debut, 200kmh in the Wrong Lane, contains three Horn productions, and is an underrated millennium-era classic.For better or worse (probably for better, to be fair), Lena Katina and Julia Volkova don’t appear on Horn’s most recent album, Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties, which employs Robbie Williams, Gabrielle Aplin, All Saints and Seal, among others, to do, well, exactly what it says on the tin. That’s the album Horn is touring this month – starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 27 July – and the occasion for his visit to  HQ, where he will be taking your questions at 1pm BST on Tuesday 23 July.

In addition to its obvious uses as a TV catch-up service, the BBC iPlayer rarely gets much credit or promotion for the breadth and intelligence of its film selection: too often I forget to check what’s on its menu for a couple of weeks, and am surprised by the accumulated treasures when I return.At the moment, for example, you can catch gems as assorted as Ben Wheatley’s excellent family-feud tragicomedy Happy New Year, Colin Burstead, Nicholas Ray’s stony-hard 1952 noir On Dangerous Ground or Miloš Forman’s whirling Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon – all streaming, of course, for free. Like an eccentric but generous auntie, the iPlayer always has some manner of treat in its bag if you just rummage around for it. Covering its highlights for this column, however, can be tricky when many films have such short, limited streaming windows: like a more haphazardly structured version of Mubi, it’s not a model that permits a lot of procrastination.When it comes to content from the online-only channel BBC Three, however, there’s rather more leeway. Still going digitally three years after being dropped from the airways, the channel is hanging on to its youth-targeted remit, with laxer scheduling to match: its films hit the iPlayer for five months at a time, giving them more word-of-mouth time to find younger, less vigilantly Beeb-attuned viewers.Best of all, however, is its fresh, bracing selection of international documentaries – unlike the many fine films found in the BBC’s Storyville strand, they aren’t overly disguised with channel branding, though the broadcaster has a habit of embellishing the titles in rather naff, literal-minded ways. Rightly nominated for an Oscar it really should have won, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap (here appearing as Minding the Gap: An American Skateboard Story) is both desperately moving and formally exhilarating in its long-term examination of two Illinois skateboarders growing up and coming to terms with damaged masculinity – both their own and that of others. If you missed it during its brief cinema run this spring, don’t sleep on it again, particularly when it’s free.A couple of festival dates aside, you wouldn’t have had a chance to catch Nancy Schwartzman’s bluntly powerful Roll Red Roll (or A High School Rape Goes Viral: Roll Red Roll, to again use the BBC’s ungainly moniker) on a big screen. The film-making is ungarnished in this fuming, activist-spirited study of high-school sexual assault, but its message is undiluted: centred on a rape case intermeshed with toxic football-team culture in an eastern Ohio school, it takes the shape of a true-crime thriller as it traces the perpetrators and consequences of the act. Riveting and conversation-starting, it’s not what most would choose to see on a night out – but it’s exactly the kind of streaming fare a public broadcaster should be making freely available.Ray \u0026amp Liz(New Wave, 15)Photographer Richard Billingham makes a vital film-making debut, dramatising his working-class childhood with social acuity and cinematic verve.3 Faces(Drakes Avenue, 15)Eight years into the film-making ban imposed on him by the Iranian government, Jafar Panahi’s darkly playful feminist mystery is his most inventive and elastic subversion of it.Alita: Battle Angel(Fox, 12)This James Cameron-scripted manga adaptation boasted dazzling 3D effects in cinemas without those, it’s just a lot of busily clanking metal.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn(Eureka, U)Elia Kazan’s first film remains less known than it should be, since it’s among his greatest: a graceful, empathetic Irish-American coming-of-age story, gorgeously transferred to Blu-ray.Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean(Eureka, 15)Another welcome Eureka re-release, Robert Altman’s elegiac bauble of Americana lives up to the oddball allure of its title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78278c1044599bf88862fe062583bdf74d67b53/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=774e7cbf02f0f5576d3315a94b4a2c84 880w","title":"arsenal v fiorentina international champions cup live","story":"That’s all for now.

And that’s all she wrote from Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium as Arsenal’s starlets impress once more in a 3-0 triumph over Fiorentina on goals by Eddie Nketiah (twice) and Joe Willock.90 min: The fourth official signals for three minutes of added time. A composed right-footed finish by the teenager from the center of the area off build-up play from Mkhitaryan and Lacazette and Arsenal are headed for three points.88 min: Martinelli showed electric pace in beating a defender in full trot and is all alone with only the keeper the keep but he can’t deposit the finish! So close to making it three for Arsenal and really putting a stamp on his introduction with the team.83 min: A poor giveaway by Xhaka forces Maitland-Niles to bring down Sottil and the midfielder is shown yellow, giving Fiorentina a free kick that’s deflected out for a corner. The pace seems to be petering out of this one. 81 min: The announced attendance for today’s match is 34,902.79 min: One (presumably) final wave of substitutions for Arsenal as Mustafi, Thompson, Xhaka, Ozil, Maitland-Niles and Martinelli come on for Medley, Monreal, Burton, Jenkinson, Nelson and Nketiah, who was brilliant today.75 min: Willock is cut down in a run on goal with a hard tackle and he’s treated by the medical staff briefly before remaining in the game. One final water break before the final quarter hour. 72 min: A raft of changes for Fiorentina as Baez, Millenkovic, Hancko, Simeone and Eyserric come on for Terzik, Ranieri, Benassi, Vlahovic and Sottil.Chants of “Ed-die! Ed-die!” ring through the lower bowl after Nketiah bags his second of the day with an elementary right-footed finish after some wonderful interplay up the right flank involving five different Arsenal players. What a day for the youngster: a pair of goals for his team and denying Fiorentina another with his clearance off the line in the 36th minute.61 min: The pace has dipped a bit at the hour mark as we pause for a mandatory water break. Emery takes the opportunity to make a few more changes with Mkhitaryan, Willock and Sokratis coming on for Saka, Olayinka and Chambers.57 min: Lacazette’s free kick has pace but doesn’t get down over the wall and soars out for a goal kick. 56 min: Terracciano comes off his line to punch a ball away but he’s well outside the box and whistled for a handball. Very weird. He’s shown yellow and Arsenal have a free kick from a dangerous position.52 min: Lacazette finds room at the top of the area and sends a thunderbolt on goal but the keeper blocks it straight to the foot of Nelson, who is offside. Arsenal appear to have reverted to a 4-3-2-1 formation. 49 min: Vlahovic has a crack on goal after catching Chambers out of postion but Leno is there to make the save.47 mins: A couple of changes for Arsenal with Leno coming on for Martinez and Lacazette for Kolasinac and the Gunners moving to a back four.46 min: And we’re off and running in the second half!Fiorentina have had their chances, but Eddie Nketiah’s goal is the difference as the Gunners lead 1-0 at the break on a sweltering Saturday in Charlotte.45 min+2: Moments from the half-time whistle Fiorentina dice the Arsenal back four once again with a deft flick from Saponara to Vlahovic, whose cheeky left-footed shot beats the keeper but rolls inches wide of the goal.45 min: Another defensive miscue by the Gunners, this time a botched offside trap, leads to a golden chance for Sottil who goes clean through on a long ball on the right, but Martinez is able to make the save. The fourth official signals for three additional minutes.41 min: The pace of this one has dragged to a near standstill and who can blame the players with this heat? Saponara is shown yellow for late tackle where he showed no real intention of going for the ball. 36 min: Another iffy moment for the Arsenal defense as Ceccherini’s header on goal is blocked by Nketiah on the back line.31 min: Jenkinson takes a crack from the right side of the area and it’s deflected out for a corner for Arsenal, who have come to life over the past five minutes and testing the Fiorentina defense along the flanks. Another water break as the sun goes down over the roofline of the stadium (if not the 91F temperature yet).27 min: Jenkinson is well positioned to make it two for Arsenal but a last-gasp tackle by Ranieri busts up the clear opportunity. That leads to a quick Fiorentina counter and a shot by Benassi that goes just wide past a fully extended Martinez wide of the far post. Big cheers from the crowd as Aubameyang and Ozil warm up along the touch line.25 min: Brilliant work by the young Nketiah to beat Venuti down the left side with the ball, but with no one trailing in support he’s left to take on the keeper on his own from a narrow angle and his shot is easily corralled. 21 min: Fiorentina send two men toward the far post as the ball is crossed in and Vlahovic’s nearly converts but it goes out for another corner. Eyebrow-raising defending has been an undercurrent for the Gunners today but they’ve not been made to pay for it yet.18 min: Another careless giveaway by Arsenal after the restart as Monreal is intercepted and Fiorentina counter quickly, but it’s disrupted by Chambers.Saka surges down the left flack before finding Kolasinac, who cuts back to Nketiah at the penalty spot and the 20-year-old cracks it into past a defender and the keeper into the back of the net. A wonderful right-footed finish by the promising youngster and Arsenal lead as the team’s take their mandated water break.15 min: More poor defending by the Gunners as Vlahovic takes advantage of a miscue and forces a good save by Martinez. Sottil nearly deposits the rebound but it’s cleared out for a corner.11 min: Now a chance for Fiorentina as the Saponara cuts into the area unmarked to meet a cross from the right flank, but he’s unable to put the header on target.8 min: Arsenal have their first serious chance of the day when Kolasinac’s shot from just outside the area deflects off a Fiorentina player and just wide of the left-hand post. The Gunners are able to work another shot off the corner but it’s quickly cleared by the Italian side.6 min: More good possession from Arsenal as they probe and look to crack Fiorentina’s well-organized 5-4-1.3 min: A steady spell of possession for Arsenal from the kickoff, but a bad giveaway at the back leads to an opportunity for Vlahovic, whose shot inside the area is blocked by a defender. Lots of red shirts everywhere in the building: a strong Arsenal crowd. And Megan Rapinoe is here.1 min: And they’re off! Arsenal are attacking from right to left in their yellow kits, Fiorentina from left to right in their all-white strips.Hello and welcome to Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium for today’s friendly between Arsenal and Fiorentina. It’s a scorching Saturday with a temperature of 91F (33C) about a half hour before kickoff as the Gunners look to make it three wins from three in their pre-season tour of the United States.

Three days into their visit, they had an offer accepted on a small, 19th-century cottage on Sartfell in the west of the island. The derelict cottage – the third highest on the island – sits alone on the brow of a hill and is known locally as Cloud Nine.“The cottage wasn’t really fit for 20th-century living, never mind 21st,” recalls Peter, a retired management consultant with a background in scientific research. The couple, who are both in their 60s, appointed the architect Will Foster to design a contemporary, carbon-neutral home for them next to the existing cottage.While their project was going through design and planning, the Isle of Man was applying for Unesco Biosphere Reserve status. “It was serendipity,” says Peter. “The island’s status was awarded in 2016, and this has given us a unique opportunity to do something we didn’t think possible.”The couple has built a Riba award-winning home (a first for the island) and, working with the Manx Wildlife Trust, they have transformed what was seven acres of farmland into a nature reserve. The project has been renamed Sartfell Restorative Rural Retreat, but the couple are clearly still living on cloud nine.“It is a privilege to be here,” says Carole, a retired educator. “Every morning, when we’re up having breakfast, we spot something out the window, drop our spoons and rush to get the binoculars. When we bought the land, there was nothing but grass and bit of bog,” she continues. “The bioersity has increased 1,000-fold: rare orchids, hen harriers, kestrels, buzzards, choughs and butterflies are all back in abundance and there are frogs in the new lake.”The lake was dug out of the land, and the rocks that were excavated have been used to clad the cast concrete shell of the building. “The architect installed a weather station on site and monitored the weather for a year before commencing the build,” explains Peter.Foster recorded 90mph winds on Sartfell, so the need to feel sheltered informed the design, which is moulded into the slope. Long, horizontal slot windows provide panoramic views across the reserve to Scotland and Ireland.“When the wind is howling and the rain is horizontal, we’re warm as toast in here, looking out at this wild weather,” says Peter.The lake also conceals a ground source heat pump, which heats the entire three-storey building. (A wood-burning stove is used to bump up the temperature on the coldest days.) “Pristine” spring water comes from a nearby borehole and the couple is planning to install a wind turbine, which will generate enough electricity to run their home and feed back into the grid. Turfed roofs provide further insulation and allow the new building to merge into the hill.A palette of raw materials has been used inside: cast concrete walls and polished floors run throughout the interior, and a spectacular iron staircase connects the three levels. On the lower ground floor are two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a games room, garage and plant room the kitchen, library and open- plan living space is on the middle floor and a panoramic office is at the top of the building.Having given themselves nine months to enjoy their retreat on Sartfell, the couple are about to begin the next phase of the project. Their vision – which is entirely self-funded – is to build a visitor centre and work with local charities and trusts to educate school children and eco-tourists about natural history, sustainable living and bioersity. Visitors will be able to explore the nature reserve and see how green energy works. (The original 19th-century cottage will soon be available to rent.)“There is a very healthy social conscience on the island,” says Carole. “But we need more young people to be interested in these things from an early age.” Peter adds: “A lot of the work we’ve done here is a process that will go on for the next generation. This is our last home, but it is also a resource for the future.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c12d7bed18a088889ea5a6eeccd2a9f99cbc345/0_348_5501_3301/master/5501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a14479723a7f64aadf81877775e16bd","title":"my new novel allowed me to grieve years after losing my baby boy","story":"In 2006 the writer Clare Mackintosh gave birth to twin boys 12 weeks prematurely. At first everything went well, but then one twin picked up a dangerous infection, and mother and father were faced with a terrible decisionAuthors are told to write what they know, but my own story was, for many years, too hard to even contemplate. I was too scared to explore the emotions I kept locked away. I wrote other books instead – became known for twisty thrillers – then last year I sat at my desk with new resolve. It was time.In November 2006 I delivered twin boys 12 weeks prematurely. Josh and Alex were baby birds, with screwed-shut eyes and translucent skin. They drank my milk through a narrow tube, breathed via a mask over their tiny faces, and day by day grew stronger.By the end of our first month in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) my husband Rob and I were pros. We told new parents where the fridges were for expressed milk, the quickest route to the canteen and where to buy a parking pass. We were in by seven and home 13 hours later, our days filled with beeps and whirs, and the stillness of a ward where lives hung in the balance.Hope for the best, they tell you, but prepare for the worst. Stress was a fish bone lodged in my throat and for months I breathed shallow and fearful, as though I might choke. I still get that feeling now, triggered by a photograph, a memory, a hospital corridor.The boys made excellent progress: breathing, feeding, putting on weight. The consultant was delighted. They wouldn’t be home by Christmas, but perhaps soon after. We began to feel excited about becoming a family.Hope is a seesaw balanced by despair and it took less than two days to tip from one to the other. Alex picked up an infection called Pseudomonas, and within hours he was being intubated. His temperature was dangerously high his pulse erratic. He began fitting.Then they took us into the quiet room. The quiet room had blinds at the window and judiciously placed tissues. The crying room, it should be called, because the news delivered there is never good. We sat on a peach sofa as the consultant told us Alex had bacterial meningitis the next few days would be critical.My memory of those days is fragmented: movie scenes I watched through closed fingers. Doctors, lumbar punctures, brain scans. A cocktail of drugs snaking into veins through bruised skin. Then the quiet room again. Walking down the corridor towards it, the consultant a few steps ahead. Afterwards I wondered whether she was silently practising how to break the news.Alex had suffered a haemorrhage so extensive that no part of his brain was untouched. In time, the consultant said, he might be able to breathe independently, but it was doubtful he would ever walk or talk.“He’s unlikely to be able to swallow,” she said. Strangely, of all the terrible news delivered in the quiet room, it was this that had the biggest impact on me. “We need you to make a decision about his future.”I recall the panic starting. Not just for the decision itself but for the act of making it. The weeks in NICU – and, before that, in Maternity, legs crossed against early labour – had lost us our agency. Yet now, when it mattered most, they were handing it back.The options were both straightforward and impossible. Keep Alex alive or let him die. Seeing it like that, written with such starkness, is as horrific as it felt that day. I recall the sensation of the ground shifting beneath my feet, as though some seismic change were taking place. Whatever we decided, life would never be the same again. The consultant was gentle and compassionate. “You need to imagine two futures,” she said. “One with a profoundly disabled son, one without that son at all.”I thought of the poem by Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken. “Two roads erged in a yellow wood  And sorry I could not travel both.” I wanted to see both roads, to know for certain what lay ahead. I wanted to know how the story ended.Panic bubbled to the surface. Rob and I had been married for three years. We were good at talking things through at finding a compromise when we disagreed. But here, there could be no compromise.“What if we don’t agree?” There was the longest pause before the doctor replied. “You have to,” she said, “because the alternative is unthinkable.” It would be to the unthinkable I would return, years later, when I wrote After the End, although it was far from my mind then. Instead I was standing at Frost’s crossroads, trying to see 10 years down each path.One way: a life without Alex. A family of three instead of four. Our future on this path was unarguably clear, and unarguably painful. When I tried to visualise it, I was overwhelmed by the pain in my heart, so intense I could hardly breathe. The second road was less certain, but no less painful. A child who required round-the-clock care. Who might never have any awareness of the world around him. A child who wouldn’t kick a ball, or climb a tree, or crawl into my lap for a cuddle.We walked through the hospital grounds, numb with grief. I watched a woman and her partner carry twin babies to their car and felt a sudden rush of bitterness. Why us, not them? I blamed myself for letting the babies come early. We tried to list the arguments for each option, circling endlessly back to the same refrain. I can’t, I just can’t. I called my father, himself a doctor. I told him I needed him, not as a grandfather, but as a medical professional. I can’t imagine how he must have felt and – looking back – it seems horribly unfair to have asked him.He was calm and wise, and everything I needed. He talked about the Hippocratic oath and the importance of doing no harm. He talked about working with nature, not against it, and he gently suggested we consider not whether Alex might live, but whether that life would be meaningful – not to us, but to him.Rob and I drove home in silence, trapped in our own nightmares. We talked through the night, falling asleep on the sofa and waking to find our cheeks wet with tears, clinging to each other as though we were drowning.Back in the quiet room – how I’d grown to hate that room – we told the consultant we wanted to remove Alex from intensive care and let him die.“For what it’s worth,” she said quietly, “I think you’ve made the right decision.” I wondered if she would have said the same if we’d asked to keep him alive, if she was simply giving us the validation we so needed to hear. I hope not, because in the years since I’ve clung to her words for reassurance.They brought Alex to us, free from machines for the first time since he was born. He won’t feel any pain, they insisted, and I wished there was a drug to do the same for us. I couldn’t tell you how long the three of us sat in that room. I read him stories and sang a lullaby, while all the time I fought to stop my tears, because I didn’t want my boy to see me cry. We brushed his hair and changed his babygro, and packed a lifetime of love into every second.The days that followed are a blur. Grief and disbelief morphed into guilt. What had we done? The doctors had said might never walk, not would. They had said unlikely to swallow, not would never. Miracles happen all the time – Alex could have recovered, he could have laughed, could have loved, could have lived. “What if?” was the constant whisper in my ear. What if you’d let him live?Writing has always been my way of making sense of the world. Back then I was a police officer, not an author, but I found I had a burning need to write about what had happened. What if we’d made a different choice? What if Rob and I had disagreed? What if the doctors had been wrong? What if, what if, what if…I couldn’t have written After the End immediately after Alex died, not only because it was too raw, but because I didn’t know how it ended. As the title suggests, the story is about what happens after a life-changing event, and for us the clock had stopped. I didn’t know then that the world moves on, that it’s possible to laugh again, love again, live again. I didn’t know that Alex’s death would teach me to seize the day, to smile more, to celebrate each fleeting moment.Writing After the End was a deeply emotional experience. What happens in the book is Max’s and Pip’s story, not mine, and the filter of fiction finally enabled me to grieve. The story broke my heart all over again, but it mended it, too, and I finally made peace with our decision. None of us can predict the future, but we can shape it as it happens. We can choose to live again. After the End by Clare Mackintosh is published by Little, Brown at £12.99.

One particularly fierce preying mantis arm posture recurs in much of the night’s high-spec choreography. Her ruffled fuchsia top, matched with pink hot pants, visually combine proud folklore and Instagram-melting R\u0026ampB couture.Just as compelling, though, is the older drama of Catalina, an update of a classic flamenco ballad by Manuel Vallejo that appeared on Rosalía’s first album, Los Ángeles (2017). She asks the crowd to be as silent as it can, for what is a masterclass in vocal control as Rosalía swells from racked coo to harsh anger.Perhaps even better is A Ningún Hombre. Here, Rosalía’s dramatic a cappella is shadowed by a Greek chorus of backing vocals, laden with disorienting effects – far more like FKA Twigs than mainstream pop. “A ningún hombre consiento que dicte mi sentencia,” she declares – I’ll let no man sentence me.For a mainstream-courting artist, Rosalía draws greedily from left field. Revving motorcycle-engine percussion and screeching tyres signal De Aquí No Sales (You’re Not Getting Out of Here), a series of threats of violence from a man to a woman. Soon the dancers are back, leading the fast hand-clapping – palmas – of flamenco, as the vocals themselves seem to pixelate.Rosalía has been touring these songs for some time now – a few weeks ago, she wowed Glastonbury. But recent months have seen a concerted uptick in excitement as she has teased what everyone assumes is a forthcoming third album with a series of fiery bangers.That most-watched video of 2019 – Rosalía’s recent collaboration with Colombian reggaetón singer J Balvin, Con Altura – came out in March. At nearly 550m views, Con Altura is, in many ways, a perfect pop storm. Sung in Spanish, the language spoken by 577 million people in the world, according to a recent study, and rising (Chinese is top of the table, English is third), it reaches parts of the world that Taylor Swift cannot. Tonight, it’s greeted with ecstatic cheers by a crowd who are in great part Spanish-speaking, but not entirely.There’s not a lot of flamenco in Con Altura instead, reggaetón looms large. Initially a Puerto Rican genre, reggaetón has been spreading across the Spanish-speaking world since the 90s and has been happily co-opted by US hip hop and R\u0026ampB. (An old hand, Daddy Yankee – reggaetón’s pioneer – currently holds the crown for most-watched music video of 2019, male or female, with Con Calma.)Anglophone pop artists became wise to Spanish-language trends more generally a few years back, most obviously with Justin Bieber’s reworking of Luis Fonsi’s Despacito (2017). Pop stars such as Madonna have since fallen into line. Katy Perry jumped on Daddy Yankee’s Con Calma last April with some verses. Having begun as a flamenco moderniser, Rosalía’s entry into world pop was via reggaetón. In 2018, her first massive exposure came on the back of her first collaboration with J Balvin, a guest slot on his Brillo single, reprised tonight.Con Altura, which was her second co-sign with Balvin, is more than just the right song in the right language with the right syncopation at the right time: it’s also awesome. “Altura” is easy to grasp, whatever your mother tongue – Spanish for “height” or “altitude”, loosely, “con altura” here means “with swagger” (with the merest hint of “being high”). The video is, playfully, set on a plane. In interviews, the 25-year-old is at pains to emphasise how visuals and choreography hold equal weight to her music. Flamenco is, of course, both cante (song) and baile (dance).A week ago, Rosalía upped her game again with the double-whammy of Dios Nos Libre Del Dinero (God Free Us from Money) and Milionària, collectively released as Fucking Money Man – a rare incursion of English into Rosalía’s art. Performing it, the spotlight is on her alone, as the singer considers the root of all evil in one breath, and then, in an explosion of dancers, palmas and geyser-like vocals, plays devil’s advocate for the folding stuff moments later. There’s another outbreak of English in a captivating cover of James Blake’s Barefoot in the Park, as per the collaboration between the two artists released in April this year.There have been questions asked in Catalonia about Rosalía’s singing Milionària in Catalan, while using Spanish expressions: s of the Catalan language consider it wrong to dilute it with Spanish. A debate also rages within flamenco over Rosalía’s cultural appropriation of Gypsy traditions. But tonight’s crowd has nothing but love for this artist, whose mission is to modernise the ancient emo of flamenco and play with genre assumptions. That she does so with a knock-out voice, eye-watering imagery, wit and style is la guinda del pastel – the icing on the cake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

And in a few days Boris Johnson could well be handed the keys to No 10. That will make things worse, not better.Any responsible future prime minister would have spent the past few weeks seeking to find a consensus in parliament for a way forward, building bridges with our European allies rather than Donald Trump, and making the case for unity not ision across the country. For Labour, we have also made it clear that whoever becomes prime minister should have the confidence to put their deal, or no deal, back to the people in a public vote.Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have not been responsible. Instead they have vied in an arms race towards a more and more extreme form of Brexit. Deeper red lines, even more ludicrous promises, but absolutely no coherent or workable plan for the country.Johnson has boxed himself in. He does not want to work with parliament to break the impasse, he wants to silence it. In a rallying cry to the extreme Brexiteers in his party, he vows to leave the EU on 31 October “do or die”. That means, by Wednesday afternoon, no deal is likely to be official government policy for the first time.In the absence of honesty from the Conservative party leadership, it is Labour’s duty to spell out the very real consequences of a no-deal Brexit. It is also our duty to take whatever steps are necessary to prevent it.There is no such thing as a “managed” no deal. There will be chaos and legal uncertainty. It won’t be Johnson paying the price of a no deal it will be working people, their families, and communities across the county. Manufacturing and farming will be hard hit, crucial medicines will be unavailable and EU citizens living in the UK will be left in limbo.The government’s own economic watchdog has warned that crashing out of the EU would tip the economy into recession. I have spent the past three years travelling across the country talking to businesses and all of them have warned me about the dangers of rupturing our trading relationship with the EU overnight.The consequences for Northern Ireland are unthinkable, too. The risks of a return to a hard border are real and could fracture 30 years of progress made under the Good Friday agreement.We simply cannot allow this to happen. Parliament must be put on a war footing to stop a no-deal Brexit when the new prime minister enters office. We did so in March and we must do so again.Every tool in our armoury must be deployed: amending legislation, forcing emergency debates and triggering no-confidence votes. The majority in parliament must act – and that will involve coordinated work across all political parties.Last week we claimed a significant victory by making it clear that shutting down parliament in the autumn would be not only unconstitutional, but also unlawful.The significance of the victory was not just that we succeeded in preventing a future prime minister shutting down parliament, but also its size and spirit. To win by a majority of more than 40 demonstrates a bloc vote determined to stop Johnson’s reckless ideas. And as for the spirit of the vote, I was struck by the fact that many Tory MPs seemed relieved rather than reluctant about rebelling – feeling a sense of pride in doing the right thing.On Tuesday morning, some ministers will sit around the cabinet table for the last time. They know very well the dangers of no deal. They will have been briefed about what it would mean for jobs, the economy, our public services and the union. They will have seen the advice and read the evidence.After they have resigned this week, I will want to work with all those former ministers who, like me, want to ensure that parliament can stop a disastrous and chaotic exit from the EU.So, this week will change everything. The national interest will lie in stopping no deal, not defending a reckless and irresponsible prime minister. The majority in parliament share a common goal: to block a disastrous no-deal scenario. I urge that majority to work together – and together we can take a stand that could change the fate of our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e6df3f62b59278ae421e8154a28b401be8fc79/605_26_2775_1664/master/2775.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cbd3911b3ea3314b03b684f024d57ad","title":"keir starmer seeks alliance against no deal with tory ex ministers","story":"Labour will seek immediate talks with Tory ministers who resign from the government on Wednesday – including the chancellor, Philip Hammond – in the hope of building a cross-party alliance to prevent Boris Johnson from embracing a no-deal Brexit.The plans, revealed to the Observer by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, underline the extent of opposition the probable next prime minister will face from across the House of Commons if he fails to negotiate a new Brexit deal that can pass through parliament by late autumn.Johnson, firm favourite to win the Tory leadership contest on Tuesday and enter No 10 the following day, has promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October come what may, which means he will be prepared to leave without a deal if necessary.But after MPs last week voted by a majority of 41 to make it more difficult for a new prime minister to force through no deal by shutting down parliament, further cross-party plans are being made to block that option.Starmer will approach Hammond and others, including the justice secretary, David Gauke, for talks on how to prevent no deal this week. Writing in today’s Observer, Starmer says parliament must be put on a “war footing” to prevent a no-deal outcome, with party allegiances put aside in the national interest.“On Tuesday morning some ministers will sit around the cabinet table for the last time,” Starmer says. “They know very well the dangers of no deal. They will have been briefed about what it would mean for jobs, the economy, our public services and the union. They will have seen the advice and read the evidence.“After they have resigned this week, I will want to work with all those former ministers who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous and chaotic exit from the EU.”Starmer says Johnson and his rival for the Tory leadership, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, have competed over recent weeks in an “arms race towards a more and more extreme form of Brexit. Deeper red lines, even more ludicrous promises, but absolutely no coherent or workable plan for the country.”Hammond suggested in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde and Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung last week that he could vote to bring down a Tory government that sought to drive through no deal against parliament’s wishes. Asked to rule out supporting a no-confidence motion in a Johnson government, the chancellor responded: “I do not exclude anything for the moment.” He added: “I will do everything in my power from my position to make sure that parliament blocks a Brexit without agreement.”The chancellor has also expressed concern about spending pledges and promises to cut taxes made by both Hunt and Johnson during the leadership contest, urging them to “stop and think” before announcing measures that the country will in all probability not be able to afford.Johnson will also come under intense pressure over whether or not to press ahead with the proposed HS2 rail project after it was reported that the costs could surpass the current budget of £56bn by almost £30bn. According to a report in the Financial Times, the chairman of the project, Allan Cook, has written to Bernadette Kelly, the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, to warn that the high-speed line from London cannot be finished within the official £56bn limit.The paper reported that, according to Cook’s preliminary findings, the project’s final cost could spiral to between £70bn and £85bn.A source close to the project told the newspaper the costs had increased because of a “combination of poor ground conditions found during the surveying work, the costs of engineering a railway to a very high specification, and the further additional costs of it being designed to run at even higher speeds than other comparable rail projects”. Johnson has said during Tory leadership hustings that he wants a review of the costs of the project.Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday that additional rail capacity was urgently needed, but that confidence was waning in the government’s ability to deliver HS2.“We desperately need additional rail capacity that connects with a fully developed Northern Powerhouse rail network,” he said. “These are critical elements of the advanced railway network that our country needs over the coming decades to address the climate crisis.“We also proposed a peer review of the project, but the government said no. They should reconsider their stance and embrace that independent review. It is clear that the government and HS2 have a lot of work to do if they’re to restore confidence in this project.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76fabc81c7ebe54179e60fa8d3ad1573514bf0f/244_665_5078_3047/master/5078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a8ea7678966e500f035208de1ff52a","title":"massive delays in cataract operations elderly vulnerable private sector","story":"People with poor eyesight are being forced to wait almost six months for operations on the NHS to remove cataracts, official figures reveal.Patients in Herefordshire are facing average delays of 168 days – five months and 17 days – for cataract surgery, according to data collected by NHS Digital, the health service’s statistical arm. Waiting times in Great Yarmouth and Waveney in Norfolk are the second worst in England at 163 days, while they now average 154 days in North Lincolnshire.The revelations have sparked warnings that the mainly older people affected are being put at increased risk of a fall because their vision is so impaired while they wait, and also that too many clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are restricting access to the operation in order to save money.“It often results in people losing their independence and becoming depressed as they can no longer do ordinary things like drive, go out at night and see bus numbers. People are more at risk of falls, which can lead to hip fractures and hospitalisation, which can be devastating.”She accused many local NHS bodies of defying guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which says that people with a cataract should be referred to have it removed promptly if it is giving them cloudy vision and affecting their quality of life. However, many CCGs are refusing to treat patients whose eyesight has not deteriorated enough in their judgement.The number of cataract removals by the NHS has risen relentlessly over the past decade – from 284,897 in 2007-08 to 377,397 in 2017-18. The vast majority of those having surgery are aged 70 or over.But the NHS Digital figures show that for many this is an achingly slow process. People in 17 CCG areas are having to wait at least four months on average for operations. In North Cumbria and Dudley, for example, the mean wait has reached four months and 28 days, while in Harrogate and Vale of York it is four months and 26 days.NHS Digital sets out the mean time in days that people have to wait in all 195 CCG areas. It does not give the longest delays endured by inidual patients, which, in many cases, will be much longer than the average.Geoffrey Dean, 80, had a cataract removed in Leeds from his left eye on 9 July after close to the NHS’s 18-week (126 days) supposed maximum wait for non-urgent care. “It’s just been frustration after frustration for me, waiting for the surgery that I needed. I was on the point of going private because I was so frustrated at waiting so long to get it removed on the NHS,” he said.He fell while waiting for the operation, injuring his hip. He also had to give up driving – “My car is my lifeline because I’m on my own” – after his eyesight deteriorated so much that he posed a risk behind the wheel. However, his sight in his left eye is now “fantastic” and he hopes to resume driving after the cataract in his right eye is removed.This means that almost one in five of the 377,397 NHS-funded cataract procedures in England that year were done in the private sector.Firms that have benefited from the NHS’s increasing inability to remove cataracts quickly enough include Ultralase, which runs 20 treatment centres in the UK. It promises to treat people within eight weeks. The growing number of cataract patients it is treating includes those who have been refused treatment by the NHS, a spokeswoman said.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We expect all patients to have timely access to cataract surgery. Through our NHS long-term plan, we will boost the number of planned procedures and reduce waiting lists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ed3e61dfcde10eaa4f4209401511d261ac3ec8/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=378c4cb2de709455ec0f718b0faa91ca","title":"dilian whyte interim wbc heavyweight title oscar rivas","story":"• Whyte wins unanimous decision after ninth-round knock down• Dave Allen taken to hospital following defeat to David PriceDillian Whyte got off the floor to beat Oscar Rivas to claim the interim WBC heavyweight and finally emerge from the shadow of Anthony Joshua. However he may still face a lengthy wait to get the world title fight he has long craved.Whyte never tends to make things easy. Rivas looked to have Whyte down and out in the ninth round, when a huge right uppercut, followed by a left hook, dropped him heavily early in the round. But Whyte is nothing if not durable and regained his composure to control the final three rounds and claim a unanimous points decision, scores of 115-112 (twice) and 116-111 reflecting his dominance.Much has been made of the time he has spent as No 1 in the WBC rankings, which now stands at more than 600 days, without getting a shot at their champion, Deontay Wilder. A lot of contenders have come and gone in that period. He found himself sidelined by one mandatory contender, then while negotiations for a Joshua-Wilder fight ground to a fruitless conclusion. One champion (Wilder) did not want to face him, another (Joshua) did not want to pay him what Whyte felt he was worth.That worth was more than the £5m he was reportedly offered to face Joshua in April at Wembley Stadium for the WBA, WBO and IBF titles. After negotiations collapsed, and other options fell through, Joshua ended up facing Andy Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden, in New York, last month, and suffering a shock defeat.While a big part of Whyte must feel that he should have been the fighter to beat Joshua, Ruiz’s victory has given Whyte the chance, really for the first time, to have a career not wholly defined by his rivalry with Joshua.After a string of tough fights, Rivas was another sturdy test for Whyte. Unbeaten in 26 fights, the Colombian, who now calls Montreal home, had the power, speed of hand and ambition to cause Whyte problems.Rivas began well, looking sharp and forcing Whyte backwards. In the second round, though, a stunning right hand from Whyte appeared to hurt the Colombian, although Rivas withstood Whyte’s follow-up attack.Whyte began to take control, working behind his jab, and keeping Rivas off him. He managed to force Whyte back to the ropes for most of the seventh round, but Whyte looked comfortable trying to draw the his sting.In the eighth, Whyte fought back with a good left-right and as Rivas tried to muscle Whyte around, the Londoner smothered him and held.And when Rivas did land a good right, Whyte responded with an uppercut that got the crowd on their feet.Things dramatically changed in the ninth, as Rivas knocked down Whyte and looked close to stopping him. Whyte rode the storm, though, as he has done several times in his career before and closed out the victory.Getting to Wilder will not be straightforward. The American has announced that he will next box Luis Ortiz, the Cuban, in November. After that, a rematch with Tyson Fury is said to be agreed. It will be down to Eddie Hearn, the promoter, to ensure the wait is not too long.Dave Allen was taken to hospital after leaving the ring on a stretcher following his defeat to David Price in a heavyweight clash on the undercard in London. Allen was pulled out by his corner at the end of the 10th-round, after taking a steady beating from Price, the former British champion and Olympic bronze medal-winner.He received oxygen while sat down, but as he tried to get off his stool, his legs buckled and he was transferred to a stretcher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d05f4be051e62b913839b7151e485d56ee2b1a/0_133_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ff3df166f093d525edbff4ba330cbc","title":"england new zealand netball world cup semi final match report","story":"Call it karma. Less than a week after England stole a World Cup from under the careful moustaches of New Zealand’s cricketers, the Silver Ferns took a measure of revenge for their menfolk. They beat the Roses by just two goals in a nerve shredder that denied Tracey Neville’s women their first Netball World Cup final – and indeed, their best ever shot at the trophy.Neville blamed “basic errors” for the 47-45 defeat and the captain, Serena Guthrie, denied the emotion of a home semi-final had got to the players. “That has nothing to do with our performance today,” said Guthrie. “We had two teams going against each other with different tactics and we didn’t execute well enough.”But Guthrie conceded nearly three times as many penalties as the unflappable Laura Langman in the rival captains’ battle at centre, and the goal shooter Jo Harten, who missed her first two shots of the game, said her team “wavered at critical moments”. “Trying to control nerves, there’s no scientific cure for that,” said Harten. “In the heat of the moment and with the crowd roaring you on, balls go astray.”The Wheel of Liverpool on the docks – stationary throughout this tournament for “essential maintenance” – was finally taking on passengers. The wheel was turning: it felt like a sign and perhaps it was – just not for the Roses. Instead a long-stalled New Zealand team, that finished with its worst ever placing at last year’s Commonwealth Games, were back in action, thanks to the coaching of Noeline Taurua and the return of a number of experienced (previously out of favour) players like Langman.Guthrie described England’s start as “disappointing”, although in the stands the emotion was more like collective shock. New Zealand scored five unanswered goals in just over three minutes. Maria Folau – booed, for the first time this week, as she took to the court – had spent the day before this game designer shopping with her husband, Israel. She demonstrated her own elan from the outset, curving the ball into the net in silky parabolas from every conceivable position, and even some inconceivable ones.It was New Zealand’s defence, however, that was England’s thorniest problem. Jane Watson’s long arm was everywhere, tipping balls out of the shooters reach, and her zone defence alongside Casey Kopua kept Harten and Helen Housby so physically constrained that at times all four women seemed glued together in a single clump.And yet England bounced back. By the end of the first quarter they had reduced the gap to three goals and in the second they looked, for a time, the team more likely to win. Folau had missed her first attempt after the break, the ball skewing a full 270 degrees around the rim. England grabbed the turnover and hunted for position until Housby was under the post – she missed but Harten scored from the rebound and followed up with a brave shot from halfway back in the circle. Housby added two of her own to draw level at 13-13.As New Zealand threatened to string together another lead, Neville sent on Natalie Haythornthwaite and told her shooters to switch bibs. Housby got in Watson’s face and Neville’s shooters totalled 15 for the quarter. Going into half-time England were three goals up, and several inflatable clappers had exploded from excitement.But for the remainder Watson’s tentacles were everywhere. At the other end the goal shooter Ameliaranne Ekenasio missed only once all match, the one error coming in the 52nd minute. “We didn’t learn our lessons quickly enough,” said Neville. “We seemed to be chasing the game, which is something we haven’t done in this tournament.”England lost the lead 11 minutes into the second half and never regained it. With three minutes to play Housby dragged them back to within two goals, as the England bench screamed their approval. But no one could fashion a turnover and New Zealand began a game of playground catch to run down the clock.Neville’s swansong will not now be a World Cup final against Australia – a team that brazened out their own tense semi-final while barely using their first-string players – but a bronze-medal match against South Africa. Phlegmatic after the game, she praised her players and a “world-class” opposition and noted the impact of Layla Guscoth’s absence: “We gave it our all but didn’t have the legs.”Harten, meanwhile, was “utterly devastated. That was the most realistic shot we’ve had of getting into the World Cup final and we’ve just fallen short of our goal … We’ll pick ourselves up and go again tomorrow, that’s for sure. We don’t want to finish on a loss. We want to take home a bronze medal tomorrow.

The risk is that the event itself lacks consequence but, as personal and season’s best times were consistently adjusted over the course of the day, it did not feel that way inside the London Stadium.The headline act from a British point of view was Muir, who announced herself on the international stage at this event three years ago when she broke Dame Kelly Holmes’s British record in the women’s 1500m. Now 26 and a European champion, Muir had been expecting to race against the Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon but the Kenyan withdrew late on with an adductor strain.In her absence Muir took it on herself to dominate the race, sitting just behind the pacemaker from the off and holding her position without ever seeming to exert herself. Her finish was more impressive than her start, however, as Muir covered the final 300 metres in 43.14 seconds and blew away the field to win by several lengths in 3min 58.25secs.“It may have looked easy, but it wasn’t,” Muir said afterwards. “I didn’t realise I ran a 57-second last lap and I’m so, so happy about that. The girls are really strong and I know that my advantage is in that kick, so I just sat in there and tried to take it easy. It was all about winning today and I did that.“London is a really fast track and it’s always a great atmosphere. The conditions are usually pretty good – it was a little bit windy today but the whole vibe of the place is really special and it makes athletes raise their game. My goal now is to win a medal in Doha.”Expectation also surrounded the 100m sprinter Hughes who, like Muir, won gold in Berlin and last summer also posted a personal best of 9.91sec. Excitement surrounding the 24-year-old only increased on the day after he breezed through his heat in a season’s best 9.96. It was a race that also featured his fellow Briton James Ellington, who was making his first competitive appearance since a serious motorbike crash in 2017.The final promised more as Hughes went up against a field that not only included the Canadian Olympic bronze medallist Andre De Grasse but the Jamaican legend Yohan Blake and current African champion, Akani Simbine. Hughes could finish only second, however, as the South African went on to win in 9.93. Hughes bettered his time from the heats as he edged past Blake in a photo finish but it was a more awkward run and contributed to a slight sense of anticlimax.“There’s a long season ahead and I’m taking my time to get sharp,” said Hughes, who had raced four times in 2019 before this weekend. “I’m happy to get a season’s best and I’m happy with the music that was playing before the race started, it got me fired up. Looking forward, I trust in my coach and I trust in myself as well. As I go forward I get more confident.”Hughes is a native of Anguilla, one of the British Overseas Territories, and chose to represent Britain. Dobbin, meanwhile, was born in Doncaster but competes for Scotland and broke a Scottish record in finishing third in the women’s 200m.With Dina Asher-Smith sitting this race out in favour of the 100m on Sunday, this was an event dominated by the Jamaican Elaine Thompson. The double Olympic champion won easily in 22.13. But Dobbin’s 22.5sec finish shaved 0.09sec off her personal best and deservedly won the acclaim of the crowd. “I usually start the season slowly and I didn’t expect it would come good today”, she said. “It’s a really great feeling.”Elsewhere there were some marquee performances and not every one came from a Jamaican. That said, Danielle Williams probably delivered the most impressive of them as the sprint hurdler ran 12.32, the second fastest time in history and a Jamaican record, in the 100m hurdles final. Interestingly, the fastest ever time in the event was also recorded at the Anniversary Games, in 2016, when the American Kendra Harrison’s 12.2 broke a record that had stood for 28 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb7575e3e79c69642b47791b84c2bc6448152e9d/462_210_3225_1935/master/3225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82a0d81358935fa723c4ba6f95ad3ab","title":"england v australia womens ashes test day three","story":"That’s all from us for today. The match report will be up here soon. Thanks for all the messages, it was an intriguing day. Have a lovely evening everyone. Good night!Well that was a curate’s egg of an innings by England. A super partnership between Jones and Knight, but after Jones fell the momentum slowed. Sciver played very well for her unbeaten 62 - but it had become a rearguard action with Brunt and Shrubsole defending doughtily. Debut Test fifties for Jones and Sciver. I guess England decided that the humiliation of losing the Test as well as the ODIs, and the state of the pitch, meant it wasn’t worth sending everyone in to have an old heave-ho. What a day for Sophie Molineux, three wickets on debut! 83rd over: England 199-6 (Sciver 62, Shrubsole 1) Last over of the day and the ball is thrown to Gardner. Sciver dashes a single. The last ball is to Shrubsole, Gardner pauses, fielders move from x to y, a seagull flies across the ground, Australia call for a helmet and shin pads and the crowd start slow hand clapping. Now then.... Shrubsole places glove on hip and ... the ball is legside ...and she pads it away. At stumps, England trail by 221 with just a day to go. To win back the Ashes, England needed to win the game. 82nd over: England 198-6 (Sciver 61, Shrubsole 1) Sciver whips Molineux to mid-wicket and they run two. Then a half-hearted chop. This has end-of-day written all over it. 81st over: England 195-6 (Sciver 58, Shrubsole 1) Australia choose not to take the new ball. Gardener continues as the shadows start to creep across the pitch. Just a single as the overs tick away. 80th over: England 194-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1). Shrubsole soaks up five balls of the over. Just a single to Sciver. Avitaj Mitra has the germ of an idea.“Hello Tanya!Clearly, this test is plodding away to an inevitable draw (as things stand currently).“Suggestion:England bat for 20 overs tomorrow.. score 271 (thus avoiding the follow on) and declare. The Aussies bat another 15-20 overs, score say 90 runs and declare.“England would need 240 odd in 50 overs on a pitch taking prodigious spin.Of course, *very* unlikely to occur, nevertheless.. considering the paucity of Women’s test matches.. this would set up a potentially thrilling finish.Opinions welcome.”I love it! But it won’t happen. 78th over: England 192-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1). It is maiden city at Taunton. Another from Molineux. Ah, there’s Enid Bakewell giving a cheery wave. . One of Wisden’s Five Greats and incredibly young at heart with a candy-crush obsession. Heres’s a super piece by Joe Wilson.77th over: England 192-6 (Sciver 56, Shrubsole 1) Gardner has a spring in her step, understandably, spinning on her right foot, arm diagonally across Shrubsole’s toes. Sciver and Shrubsole have a mid-wicket chat. Are there instructions?Will they tarry a little less? And while we’re at it women’s cricket experts - I’m ashamed to ask this but why only four days?76th over: England 190-6 (Sciver 54, Shrubsole 0) Shrubsole is watchful, pretty keen to get down the other end as Molineux flights the ball with some style. 75th over: England 189-6 (Sciver 54, Shrubsole 0) A wicket maiden for Ash Gardner! A great little innings there by Brunt - 75 balls and blood sweat and tears in that there 15. Brunt edges onto the stumps via her pads . The end of a super vigil - but I fear doom’s door is now open. Gardener’s first wicket in Test cricket!74th over: England 189-5 (Sciver 54, Brunt 15) Molineux spins one past Shiver’s bat. Tasty. Then paddle-sweeps for two. The new ball will be available in six overs. 73rd over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Schutt bowls another maiden. The acceleration waits for another over. Abhijato has an answer to Geoff’s question:“I’m inclined to go with Alyssa Healy, the next best all-rounder in the side. She pulls off excellent feats of athleticism behind the stumps to back up a consistent pair of gloves, while also being a highly successful aggressive opener in the mould of Gilchrist. Her outstanding run of form won Australia the last T20 World Cup and she could very well do it again. If I can’t have Ellyse Perry in my team, I’ll shout and stamp the ground like Tanya if I can’t have Alyssa Healy in my team, I’ll cause a riot.”72nd over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Another maiden by Molineux. 71st over: England 186-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Sciver is tempted to have a go at a wide one from Schutt. Don’t do it Nat! Oush, the next one nearly goes through her, a desperate last minute jam down with the bat. So we’ve got 12 overs to go, and England still trail by 234. They must risk defeat to have a go at victory, no? They must hit, hit and hit again. Scratching my head. Anyone?70th over: England 185-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Lanning turns to Schutt with her idiosyncratic two-step-bend at the top of her mark. A word here for Brunt who is having to play an atypical knock, curbing her natural instincts. Actually I read a super piece (that will appear in the next Nightwatchman magazine) about the mental strain needed to do that. Geoff Wignall is setting OBO readers quizzes: “I was wondering: if you could steal one of the Aussies to play for England but you couldn’t have Perry, whom would you choose (and why)?”I can’t have Perry? Why not? Shout and stamps. 68th over: England 185-5 (Sciver 52, Brunt 14) Nicole Bolton hurts her right hand ing to stop a drive at extra cover. The physios runs on with their bag of tricks and they bandage up her wrist and thumb with flesh coloured tape. Sciver watches Molineux’s next three deliveries with great care and shows a beautifully straight backJohn Box too wants a scorecard. Fingers crossed! If it doesn’t get sorted tonight - not sure if I’ve emailed the right person - we’ll get it done for tomorrow morning. Thanks for the reminder. 67th over: England 182-5 (Sciver 51, Brunt 11) . I’m enjoying Vlaeminck’s effort and enthusiasm. All long limbs and youth. Brunt pulls down to long leg off the last ball, they go through for a single and that’s the fifty partnership. Ah, the camera pans back. How gorgeous Taunton looks, those spires and hills. The warmth of the evening sun. No jumpers on the fielders yet.66th over: England 180-5 (Sciver 51, Brunt 10) I don’t want to jinx anyone here but Sciver and Brunt are looking - dare I say it - untroubled out there. They nurdle a couple from Molineux, order a pinna colada and enjoy the evening sun.65th over: England 178-5 (Sciver 50, Brunt 9) Sciver cuts Vlaeminck confidently and that’s her maiden Test fifty in her fifth Test. She’s played very well. She smiles broadly but there is still a lot to do. England trail by 243.64th over: England 171-5 (Sciver 49, Brunt 7) Jonassen again. Sciver pulls a shortish ball, it floats towards the boundary and she moves on to 49. This is the saddest thing about the lack of long-form women’s cricket.63rd over: England 171-5 (Sciver 45, Brunt 7) Vlaeminck runs in accompanied by a chorus of seagulls. Hold on to your ice-creams. Just one off the over, a single down to fine leg.These Australians seem an impressive and unrelenting bunch.Re the treatment of women’s cricket: I’m sure if this was a men’s test I wouldn’t have to scroll down to 5 hours ago to discover the Aussie 1st innings total - might even get a scorecard link. A matter for your corporate overlords?Er....I’ve gone blank as to what we normally do. Let me try for a link. 62nd over: England 170-5 (Sciver 44, Brunt 7) Jonassen raises her hands and her voice for hearty lbw shout - but it was bat before boot. Not out. Just discovered that Nat Sciver nudged Vlaeminck for the 100,000th run in women’s Test cricket in the last over. Rosette someone!61st over: England 169-5 (Sciver 43, Brunt 7) Tayla Vlaeminck runs in - 70mph isn’t bad for a loosener. She was a bit all over the place in her first spell, perhaps a little longer out at pasture will have settled the nerves. She mixes it up - a bouncer, full length and a widish delivery on the offside. Just one from the over. Another cracking piece on Perry. Loving the fact the best writers WANT to write about women’s cricket. What a sea change. 60th over: England 168-5 (Sciver 42, Brunt 7) A Nat Sciver e saves her skin as she and Brunt scamper two from Jonassen. A little later on in the over Sciver is tempted forwards to prod and the ball, I think, falls just short of Meg Lanning at slip. Australia’s spinners revelling in Ciderabad. And that’s drinks! Crucial session coming up now, this summer’s evening in Somerset.  59th over: England 164-5 (Sciver 39, Brunt 7) Sciver gets busy, cracking Gardner for a boundary through mid-wicket and scampering a few more.  58th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 32, Brunt 7) Ok Adam and I are having computer malfunctions. Hopefully this is me now....57th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Gardner through another maiden, played watchfully by Brunt. She is 6 from 34 balls - not an equation you would normally associate with the power hitter.57th over: Australia 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Gardner again, reeling in. Brunt is looking a bit static and nervous but she’s crowded by fielders. She mistimes a few. A maiden. 56th over: England 153-5 (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Sciver does have a pop at Molineux this time around but doesn’t make contact from the standing sweep position. There’s a polite enquiry, turned down. She does make good contact down the ground for a couple. I wonder if they will try Vlaeminck again for another burst at Brunt? 56th over: Australia 153-5  (Sciver 28, Brunt 6) Sorry all computer malfunction. 55th over: England 151-5 (Sciver 26, Brunt 6) Gardner in again from the River End, Sciver off strike first ball with a single to square leg, Brunt doing her best to keep the rest out. This is a good spell.53rd over: England 148-5 (Sciver 25, Brunt 6) Thank you Adam. I’m all for getting funky but I think England are in a bit of a funk here. An attackdefend kerfuffle - what price a win? An inside edge by Brunt off Molineux skiddaddles away for a couple. 54th over: England 150-5 (Sciver 25, Brunt 6) With two to Brunt to finish the otherwise probing Molineux set, also through her legs (!), England have raised their 150. 53rd over: England 147-5 (Sciver 24, Brunt 4) Shot, Nat. Sciver gets down the track to turn a Gardner off break into a full toss, giving it the treatment. That’s the aggression we enjoy from this fine all-rounder. She gets in behind the rest, smothering the spin from around the wicket. And with that, friends, I’m out of here. Thanks for your company this afternoon. Back to Tanya to take us through to the close. Let’s hope England do reach 271 and get FUNKY! 52nd over: England 142-5 (Sciver 19, Brunt 4) Brunt gets off strike from the first of Molineux’s new over out to cover, Sciver doing likewise. Brunt has ample air to work with but doesn’t swing. Yet.  51st over: England 140-5 (Sciver 18, Brunt 3) Gardner fires down a 75-second maiden at Sciver to keep the pressure on. The final offering is a clever one, going on with the arm and past the outside edge.50th over: England 140-5 (Sciver 18, Brunt 3) Molineux really has been brilliant today, giving nothing at any stage. Ha, Sciver NATMEGS her behind square leg for one. I’m here for all the 2017 World Cup nostalgia you’ve got. 49th over: England 138-5 (Sciver 17, Brunt 2) I like this change, Gardner on to replace Perry to try in an effort to go through the gate with her off breaks. Just the one from from her first over back, Brunt keeping the strike. Do they encourage the Barnsley Express to have a big crack? Or Sciver, even? Both can make bulk runs in a hurry. 48th over: England 137-5 (Sciver 17, Brunt 1) Sciver whips away the final ball of the successful Molineux over through midwicket. England’s longish tail will be exposed at some stage the all-rounder needs to do the bulk of the heavy lifting.Hard to tell from one replay if that was padbat or batpad but without DRS it’s academic - Taylor is out. Molineux gets her third with an excellent straighter one.47th over: England 132-4 (Sciver 13, Taylor 5) A deep point for Perry now, reinforcing that she has been more than a fraction short in this second spell. She’s straighter and fuller to both players, each clipping singles to midwicket. I wonder whether we might see the Bendigo Bullet for a little burst here before Taylor is set?46th over: England 129-4 (Sciver 12, Taylor 4) They take their time again to set the field for Taylor. Once set, Molineux gives Taylor flight and when she overpitches, those rubbery wrists of the England ‘keeper get a chance to snap the ball through midwicket to score a classy boundary to get off the mark.

But this is the year of the last-minute summer.Huge numbers of people have delayed making bookings thanks to a messy cocktail of weather, politics and a plunging pound. Travel agents, tour operators, hotels and B\u0026ampBs all say they have been battling Brexit uncertainty to get people to make bookings for months.Yet in the last few weeks, the yen for travel appears to have returned. More than 8,800 planes took off on Friday – the final tally will probably break records, according to the National Air Traffic Control Service – with two million travellers due to fly out of the UK over the weekend, said travel agents’ association Abta.Those staying in the UK are also heading off, making 13.4m car journeys throughout the weekend – 4m more than this time last year – although there were the usual problems: a crash on the M5 led to 70 miles of tailbacks in Devon and Somerset.David Hope of GfK, a market research firm which monitors package holiday sales, said travel companies had been discounting fiercely to overcome political problems. “It’s been massively impacted by Brexit,” he said, pinpointing the moment when people were put off booking holidays as 16 December 2018 – the date when a cabinet discussion about post-Brexit travel arrangements was leaked to a newspaper.The good news for travel companies may not last if planned strikes at several airports go ahead. Easyjet baggage handlers at Stansted and about 4,000 staff at Heathrow are due to walk out for two days if the pay disputes between employers and the Unite trade union are not resolved, with further two-day strikes planned. Talks continue at conciliation service Acas. Workers at Gatwick and British Airways pilots are also holding strike ballots.The fall in the value of the pound is also prompting more people to search for all-inclusive holidays, according to Travel Supermarket’s Emma Coulthurst. “The storm of Brexit and its impact on currency exchange rates has seen many delay booking and prices come down as a result of the drop in demand,” she said. “There are many family holidays available from as little as £300 per person or less for a family of four this summer school holiday. That’s unheard of.”Spain – particularly Tenerife and Mallorca – remain the most popular places to go, but Coulthurst reported a surge in interest in Turkey, especially the southern coastline near Antalya.The biggest gainer is Tunisia, whose tourism industry collapsed after the terror attacks in 2015. UK nationals made 155,000 trips to Tunisia in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, but this year should see levels similar to 2015’s 411,000 visitors.Sardinia, the Costa Dorada near Barcelona, and Bulgaria are also all up, Coulthurst said, at the expense of Orlando, Dubrovnik and Dubai.A According to Brett Gerrett of Sunvil, an independent travel agent in southwest London. “I haven’t seen fares in this position in the last six years. They started low, went high, and came back down again. It’s been a very strange year.”Gerrett was at Heathrow early on Friday in an effort to beat the crowds. “We’re on the tarmac at the moment. I’m on a BA flight going to Madrid and I’ve paid £119 for a club seat - and it’s the second day of the summer holidays. We’ve had people coming in, not complaining exactly, but making a point to us that they paid high prices in advance and now it’s lower. Nobody ever does that.”Travellers with more money to spend were also leaving things late. Pete Brudenell, of luxury villa firm, CV Villas, said June bookings were up by more than half, particularly for Portugal and Turkey.Staycationers in the UK banking on a reprisal of last year’s long hot summer will be pleased to see temperatures hit 30C in parts of England this week.But owners of B\u0026ampBs and self-catering accommodation have also been hit by the last-minute summer.“We’re getting shorter stays and later bookings,” said Ali Kayley, who runs a glamping and holiday cottage business at Westley Farm in the Cotswolds. “People are booking in the same week, and that wasn’t happening a year ago.”She said there had been a marked decline in the number of European visitors: “We get lots of German and Dutch families and our numbers are considerably down this year.” Some European guests were put off by fears they would need a visa to get into the UK: “One of our regular guests from Holland was due to come in April, and he wanted a guarantee that he would get his money back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9f3f6210d41a185b450a771b0fce185d07647e/0_14_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858fd4133d5649a9e39b40e8da3be723","title":"hawaii mauna kea thirty meter telescope","story":"Officials in Hawaii have said they will not call up additional national guard troops or use force on peaceful protesters who are blocking access to the state’s highest peak.Friday was the fifth day of protests at Mauna Kea in response to the closure of the road to the summit so construction equipment for the $1.4bn Thirty Meter Telescope, a major new international astronomy project, can be taken up. No trucks have made the trip.The Thirty Meter Telescope obtained permits to build after a decade-long review. Last year the Hawaii supreme court ruled the permits were obtained legally.There have been protests in other parts of Hawaii, including on Maui and at the state capitol in Honolulu.Hawaii governor David Ige said his priority was to keep everyone in the community safe, including the activists. The 80 guard members who have been on the Big Island since the start of the protests will remain, state officials said.The governor said last week national guard units would be used to transport personnel and equipment as well as to enforce road closures. Ige said on Friday no more troops would be called in, but he did not remove an emergency proclamation he enacted on Wednesday. The order broadened state authority to remove protesters, including the use of national guard troops.Big Island mayor Harry Kim, who met Ige on Friday morning as about 800 to 1,200 activists gathered on the mountain, said he hoped protesters and officials would take time to discuss a better way forward.“We all need to step back a little bit,” Kim said. “This is still our home, this is still our family. On both sides.”One protester, teacher and cultural practitioner Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, said the battle is bigger than the telescope.“The TMT and Mauna Kea is just the focal point,” she said. “For me it’s just a galvanizing element. It goes back to the role that foreigners played and continue to play in Hawaii.” From 18th-century explorer James Cook to laborers brought to plantations and today’s tourism, the telescope is another example of outside interests overtaking Hawaiian culture, she said. “They capitalize and commercialize our culture,” Wong-Kalu said. “They prostitute the elements that make us Hawaiian. They make it look pretty and make it look alluring in an effort to bring more money into this state.” But not all Native Hawaiians see the telescope as representative of past wrongs. “My family feels that they’re trying to use the TMT to boost their sovereignty issue,” said Annette Reyes, who supports the telescope project. “I want sovereignty for the Hawaiian people. I want them to have their country back. But TMT shouldn’t be the lightning rod for it.” Reyes pointed to telescope officials’ pledge to provide $1m every year to boost science, technology, engineering and math education. She said opponents have called her a fake Hawaiian for supporting the project.Notable politicians have weighed in. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard followed fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in supporting protesters. Gabbard said in a statement Ige should withdraw the emergency declaration and sit down with protesters.“Trust must be earned – it is wrong that state leaders have approved the development of a new telescope on a new site on Mauna Kea, without first ensuring the timely removal of decommissioned facilities along with full restoration of those sites,” Gabbard said.“This failure and a history of broken promises has resulted in the standoff that we are seeing today.”Earlier in the day, Sanders said in a tweet since deleted: “We must guarantee native people’s right to self-determination and their right to protest. I stand with Native Hawaiians who are peacefully demonstrating to protect their sacred mountain of Mauna Kea.”Sanders’ campaign did not immediately respond to an email asking why the tweet was deleted.Protest leader Kaho’okahi Kanuha said protesters have been bracing for law enforcement to show up in force ever since Ige signed the emergency proclamation. That was the day officers arrested 34 protesters.Lieutenant governor Josh Green said he planned to meet with people about the issue.“I believe that this struggle is more about the heart of Hawaii and our sense of self and dignity, especially for the Hawaiian people, than it is about a telescope. It is about cultural recognition and people’s self worth,” he said in a Facebook post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b82da624815c3263c64d8a2cb192778791fc2fe/0_192_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd9151b6d24d4f2ab9606bfde048d217","title":"new hampshire poet laureate condoleezza rice","story":"New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu has abandoned his pick for state poet laureate, amid growing criticism of the man’s work and how he was selected.Daniel Thomas Moran, a retired dentist and former poet laureate of Suffolk county, New York, was never formally nominated for the New Hampshire post. But Sununu, a Republican, had chosen him.Even before the discovery of a sexually suggestive poem Moran wrote about former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, some said he was not qualified.On Friday, a spokesman for the governor said he would soon put a new name up for a vote.State law requires the directors of the Poetry Society of New Hampshire (PSNH) to submit to the governor “the name or names of persons whom they deem to be worthy” of being poet laureate. The governor is not required to follow the recommendations.Moran read a poem entitled New Hampshire at Sununu’s second inauguration in January. He was one of 12 poets whose names were given to the committee by the poets themselves or supporters.The PSNH selection committee recommended Jennifer Militello of Goffstown, an award-winning poet and founder of the New Hampshire Poetry Festival.Sununu put Moran’s name on a list of upcoming nominations in March but held off on asking for a vote by the executive council, which approves state contracts and nominations. In June, the governor met with PSNH members and asked for additional material on alternative candidates.Then on Thursday, an excerpt of Moran’s poem referencing Rice was published by Slate.According to Slate, the poem, entitled White on Rice, read in part:not the lucky ones,Happier than abarrel of nuns.we would have our funIn the lavatory“White on Rice,” Slate reported, “appears in The Book of Moran, a 2007 collection published by Asinine Poetry, whose website says it is devoted to ‘mostly kinda funny’ poetry.”The article linked to other Moran poems on the Asinine website: A Sonnet for Our Lesbians in Orbit, An Ode to Dame Edna and The Girls of Vancouver 2010, “a tribute to female Olympians”.Sununu’s spokesman said the governor was only recently made aware of the Rice poem and “finds it offensive”, but had chosen Moran based on the entirety of his work.“Governor Sununu nominated Daniel Thomas Moran, who has published 11 books, due to his extensive experience and impressive credentials, as well as to bring a fresh perspective to the role of poet laureate,” Benjamin Vihstadt said. Hours later, Vihstadt said Sununu would nominate someone else.Don Kimball, president of the PSNH, said the members urged Sununu to make a different choice during the June meeting.“We said: ‘We understand that you’re the governor and you have the right, but is it the right thing to do?’” Kimball said.Like Sununu, the committee was not aware of Moran’s poem when it vetted candidates, Kimball said. But Marie Harris, a former poet laureate who served on the committee, said Moran failed to rise into even the top half of the field based on his work, vision, connection to the poetry community and ability to serve as its ambassador.Harris, who called the Rice poem and several others “a travesty, really, of what poetry is meant to be”, said the controversy goes beyond the state. She noted New Hampshire has produced five national poet laureates.“We have a national reputation of being a fine place for poetry, and this makes a mockery of that,” she said. “And it also taints the process going forward because why would anyone put up a nominee if all the qualifications in the world didn’t count?”Both Harris and Kimball said their chief complaint was not with Moran, but with Sununu’s decision to circumvent a well-established process.This was not the first time, however, a governor bypassed the PSNH. In 1999, the society’s then-president criticized Democratic governor Jeanne Shaheen because she picked Harris instead of the group’s choice, saying she had broken a long tradition of keeping politics out of poetry.Harris said her case was different. That year, newcomers to the society put forward someone who was not qualified, she said.Shaheen nominated her after consulting with the state council on the arts, she said. And the controversy ultimately led to a revamping of the vetting process, including the creation of a committee that includes outsiders interested in writing and the arts and a detailed rubric for evaluating candidates.Moran did not respond to phone or email messages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d769d25288ceaa23c275bb87d96b73c5a0e98fe/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c466fbadd311e7643c390c7872762c01","title":"uk first climate assembly camden draws up wishlist for council action","story":"Camden council officials say they intend to implement at least some of the panel’s ideasBritain’s first climate “citizens assembly” opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change.Camden’s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads.The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn.Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. “I hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,” said Georgia Gould, the council leader. “That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.”Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening.“I’m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,” said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants.By the end of Saturday’s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions.They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid £150 in vouchers for their time.Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through.“Most people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that iniduals can’t do much,” said Khalil Miah. “It’s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.”Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too.“It is absolutely great,” said Merve Öner, a student on the assembly. “It’s a erse community and it’s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00b95ba248a4364bf2f3b447ad5d44aebadf7d5f/911_800_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=1200\u0026amp;height=630\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;overlay-width=100p\u0026amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026amp;s=bcca713ce1e25788659cdd57d945f879","title":"british airways suspends cairo flights as security precaution","story":"Services to Egyptian capital halted for seven days to allow for security review, says airline British Airways has suspended all flights to Cairo for seven days as a security precaution.The airline made the surprise announcement last night that all flights into the Egyptian capital were halted.A statement said: “We constantly review our security arrangements at all our airports around the world, and have suspended flights to Cairo for seven days as a precaution to allow for further assessment. The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our priority, and we would never operate an aircraft unless it was safe to do so.”Lufthansa, which operates routes from Frankfurt and Munich, said: “As safety is the number one priority of Lufthansa, the airline has temporarily suspended its flights to Cairo today as a precaution, while further assessment is being made.”Lufthansa said is planned to resume flights on Sunday.The airline said in a statement: “As safety is the number one priority of Lufthansa, the airline temporarily suspended its flights to Cairo on July 20 as a precaution. Egyptian officials, cited by the Reuters news agency said Cairo’s international airport was notified by the airline that it was suspending flights to and from London for two days. Airport officials said the decision came after British security officials conducted routine security checks earlier this week.However, Ahmed Fawzi, chairman of the Cairo Airport Company, told Egyptian newspaper Al Shorouk that British Airways did not inform them of any concerns regarding airport security prior to cancelling flights. He said Cairo airport had not received any notification of British Airways’ decision, and blamed it on “an internal affair inside the company”.A second Egyptian newspaper, Al Masry Al Youm, cited Egypt’s ministry of civil aviation, which emphasised the one-week suspension did not mean a permanent halt to flights. Officials said the decision was one of “security and political measures that are concerned with internal affairs, and not those of Egypt”, and pointed to a series of upcoming of strikes expected to take place at Heathrow Airport.The ministry claimed UK security checks last week, which included Cairo and Egypt’s second busiest Hurghada airport, resulted in “excellent ratings” for both airports. They said all other airlines were operating as usual at Cairo airport. Egyptair, which also flies between London and Cairo, said its flights were unaffected.BA told the Department for Transport of its suspension decision ahead of the announcement. A government spokesman said: “We are aware that British Airways is notifying passengers it has decided to suspend flights to Cairo temporarily.”The Foreign Office updated its advice to travellers to Egypt yesterday advising travellers affected to contact the airline. The FCO has warned against any travel to and from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, following the bombing of a Russian passenger jet in 2015 which killed 224 passengers and crew but has not issued similar warnings against travel to and from Cairo.Egypt’s government has been pressing for a resumption of flights to Sharm el-Sheikh. MPs questioning transport ministers in parliament said Egypt has invested nearly £20m to improve security failings the UK government had highlighted. It also employed a UK-security firm, Restrata, to train more than 6,000 Egyptian airport security staff in a bid to get flights restarted.“There’s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK,” the British advice said. An estimated 415,000 British nationals visited Egypt in 2018, according to the FCO.Passengers alerted before boarding last night’s flight used social media to show a letter handed out by British Airways warning that security was behind the decision.“Currently about to board a British Airways flight to Cairo and it’s cancelled,” one affected flyer wrote. “Not for a day. Not for two days but for seven. Security risk. Someone knows something we don’t.”A BA spokeswoman said it could not immediately offer more information."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3bf38612863b29c9be79787086f2e7d980dd69/0_90_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121b6a34917e1dd9f08aa7ff8d9bc1c8","title":"japan love mass radio exercise rajio taiso","story":"“One, two, three, four … five, six, seven, eight …” That is the cue for half a dozen people braving a humid morning at Kamezuka park in Tokyo to bend, stretch, jump, and run on the spot. The group’s personal trainer is a portable radio perched on the top of a children’s slide. A male voice’s simple instructions, issued to a jaunty piano accompaniment, has become a staple of daily life in Japan since the broadcasts, known as rajio taisō (radio calisthenics), first hit the airwaves almost a century ago.The three-minute routine is the perfect way to start the day, says Yukihide Maruyama, a 79-year-old retired businessman who has performed the routine nearly every day for a decade. “The exercises aren’t that difficult and afterwards you feel like your body has properly woken up.”Japan’s communal exercise regime has barely changed since the health insurance bureau of the post office, inspired by morning exercises broadcast by the US insurance firm politan Life, launched rajio taisō in November 1928 to celebrate Emperor Hirohito’s formal ascension to the chrysanthemum throne.Today, as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, Japan’s calisthenics community is hoping to raise interest in rajio taisō, with a mass workout at the end of this month involving 10 million people in every one of the country’s 47 prefectures, including 12,000 inside the Games’ main stadium.After Japan’s defeat in the second world war, allied forces banned rajio taisō because of its close association with militarism. But in 1951, the education and health ministries enlisted experts and the life insurance industry to devise a new programme, to be broadcast on NHK public radio.In 2003, the most recent year for which data is available, 27 million people said they took part in morning calisthenics more than twice a week, whether at work, at home in front of the TV or with neighbours in the local park. Children perform rajio taisō before school sports days or during special summer holiday sessions, earning credits that can be exchanged for snacks, stationery and other gifts.Regular participants cover a broad cross-section of Japanese society: construction, factory and office workers, including the 10,000 employees of the Tokyo metropolitan government, who are encouraged to leave their desks and start moving at 3pm every weekday.NHK radio broadcasts the routine four times a day – starting at 6:30am, except Sunday, while the TV version airs three times a day, except at weekends.There are two standard routines – the second slightly more challenging than the first – each involving arm rotations, forward bends, straddle jumps and other aerobic exercises designed to move every muscle and leave participants slightly out of breath. In 1999, a routine was added for people who use wheelchairs or have other mobility issues.“Studies show that people who exercise this way for just a few minutes a day have improved bone density, reduced risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack, and are generally in better physical shape than other people their age who don’t exercise,” says Yasuo Fukushi, secretary general of the Japan Radio Taiso Federation.“There has never been any pressure to modernise the programme, because people have grown up with it and know it off by heart,” adds Fukushi, who believes the routine helps explain the impressive life expectancy of Japanese people.“We even do this when it rains,” says Tomomi Okamoto, a company director who joins the Kamezuka park sessions in all weathers. “It gets the blood pumping and I always feel much better afterwards. It’s a great way to start the day,” she says. “But it’s not just about the exercise – it’s a way of communicating with your neighbours and getting to know people.”Rajio taisō has gained a following in Brazil, Peru and other countries with large Japanese communities, and is behind a recent push in Britain to encourage older people to take more exercise amid warnings that, if left unaddressed, years of physical inactivity could cost the NHS at least £1.3bn in real terms between now and 2030.In April, Sport England, in collaboration with the thinktank Demos, and Anchor Hanover, a care and housing provider for older people, launched 10 Today – a Lottery-funded six-month pilot programme that features 10-minute exercise programmes broadcast online and on two community radio stations three times a week.“There is evidence that physically active older adults have lower rates of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and colon and breast cancer compared with more inactive adults,” the report said.The Kamezuka park regulars have finished their workout and, invigorated by their burst of activity, vow to return tomorrow. “Most of us are getting on, and it can be hard going on a cold, dark morning, but for some reason we all keep turning up,” says Maruyama, who has barely broken a sweat. “And I’d say we’re all in pretty good shape.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3962921.1563650414!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"around 11 500 women given out of date cervicalcheck smear tests hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt was believed that the tests were likely to remain accurate even though they had expired, but the HSE said it recalled some women for a second test as a precaution.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe FileA US-bound Aer Lingus flight has made an emergency landing at Dublin Airport this Saturday afternoon after suffering an engine failure on departure believed to have been caused by a bird-strike.Aer Lingus fight EI-115 (EI-11J) took off from Dublin at 1.36pm and was bound for Philadelphia in the US state of Pennsylvania. Almost immediately after departure the crew issued a Pan-Pan radio distress call reporting they had struck a bird on departure.The pilot reported: “Pan-Pan, the Shamrock One One Juliet (EI-11J), birdstrike on the runway.”The bird-strike was also observed by air traffic controllers who confirmed seeing a flame-out of the right engine. It is understood that at least one bird was ingested by the right engine resulting in the engine flame-out and subsequent engine failure.An immediate inspection of the runway was ordered and carried out by ground crews to check for any debris that might affect a departing or arriving aircraft.In the meantime, the Boeing 757-200 jet levelled off at 3,000 feet and entered a holding pattern north of the airport while the crew went through their checklists before returning to Dublin to land again.The pilot also asked controllers to request fire crews to inspect the aircraft’s brakes after landing to ensure they had not overheated.The flight landed safely at 2.05pm and was met by airport fire and rescue crews. The jet was able to taxi to the terminal where engineers were waiting to inspect the engine.An airline spokesperson said: “Aer Lingus flight EI115 (Dublin to Philadelphia) was required to turn back when the aircraft experienced a bird strike shortly after take-off. The aircraft landed safely at Dublin Airport and all guests and crew safely disembarked. As a result flight EI115 and return flight EI114 (Philadelphia to Dublin) have been cancelled.“Our guest relations team are working on a recovery plan for affected guests who will be offered hotel accommodation as required and will be accommodated on the next available transatlantic services.

Photograph:  Daniel KeaneIn 1957, aged 23, Thomas Mulligan left his home in Lucan, Co Dublin, for England, to find work and a better life. By the end of the decade, he had become one of nearly 60,000 Irish who had made the journey.Mulligan’s story is a familiar one. He found work as a plasterer, before setting up his own business and settling down in north London with a family of five. Though it is home, London often feels like a lonely place for him, he says.“In London, you could stand in a pub all night and no one would talk to you. In Ireland, everyone would talk to you,” says Mulligan, who visits the London Irish Centre in Camden three times a week.He says it’s “a good place even just to meet people for the craic”. Mulligan lives alone but has regular visits from his family, and charities and support groups are a vital presence in his life.He had spent his last months in a care home in Greenford in west London. Unlike Mulligan, Lynch had no one in his circle. For many, it is a stark reminder that some slip through the cracks. Sometimes, the reasons are complicated.“The pubs and churches served as social support systems. There’s nothing to go to now,” especially as the Irish population has been getting older, Danny Maher says. Maher runs a homeless charity called Ashford Place. “It has created the sense of a loss of identity and the loss of our role in society, because all of these iconic places that were part of our identity have gone.”The older generation of Irish emigrants have fewer connections with their younger counterparts than in the past, he says, because pubs and clubs “have faded in popularity and importance”.New IrishYounger Irish emigrants are more likely to meet through social media than at the local Irish pub. Inter-generational socialising, so common in Ireland, is rarely found in London’s Irish community.“I saw a headline in the Irish Post a couple of years ago saying ‘Clapham is the new Cricklewood’. What that said very clearly is that the new Irish generation goes to Clapham now, not Cricklewood,” Maher says.Based in Cricklewood, Ashford Place offers accommodation to the homeless, helps some people to resettle back to Ireland, often after decades abroad, and runs a variety of community programmes.The links between loneliness and isolation are self-evident, Maher says: “We must not allow the reality of these changes in the community to cause a rise in levels of street homelessness or feelings of isolation in the community.”The number of Irish rough sleepers in London has fallen by 40 per cent over the last five years, but this has only been possible on the back of tireless work by institutions such as Ashford Place and other Irish charities.Despite the influx of new Irish after Ireland’s economic crash in 2008, the Irish population in the UK is rapidly ageing, and more likely to live alone. In 2011, the UK census showed that a fifth of Irish 65-year-olds live alone, the highest of any other ethnic group in the UK.In 2001, the Irish were the largest foreign-born group in the UK, still bolstered by the hundreds of thousands who had moved there in the 1950s and 1980s.Since then, as the 1950s generation has aged and died, the Irish-born population has shrunk by almost a quarter, overtaken by Poles, Indians, Pakistanis and Romanians.Lack of fundingIn the most recent census in 2011, 430,309 people living in Britain identified themselves as Irish-born, down 37 per cent from a peak of 683,000 in 1961. The Annual Population Survey carried out by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in 2018 put the Irish-born population for the UK at just 380,000.The London Irish Centre in Camden, established in 1954, offers a range of services such as befriending groups, hardship grants and welfare advice. These service help to tackle isolation, says Brian Hanley who is the centre’s director of community services.“As people get older, they want a sense of familiarity and background. They want to meet people who understand their culture. But these services don’t have the resources to look at the more culturally-sensitive aspects of care and support,” he says.Cuts in public spending made by the Conservatives since 2010 have gradually eroded care services to “the bare minimum”, says Hanley.“It’s difficult to get the basic support for people. The lack of funding does make it a struggle for groups like us to make ends meet, but it’s essential that these culturally-sensitive services are funded.”News, features, interviews and personal stories by and about the Irish around the world"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Five people missing after blast in city of Yima sends ball of fire and thick smoke into airSuspect named by police after attack on Kyoto animation studio that left 33 deadMourners gather at the edge of police cordon around charred building as man detainedMany more injured, including man believed to have started the fire at Kyoto buildingHafiz Saeed is accused of being behind 2008 assault that left more than 160 people deadKids locked doors and refused to exit vehicle when stopped by policePolice with riot gear clash with protesters using metal barriers to block roadsProtesters and police clashed on streets in march against extraditionsComes after 51 people and dozens injured killed in terrorist attack on two mosques\u0026lsquoLennon Walls\u0026rsquo become violent flashpoints as well as potent symbols of resilient protestIndigenous Australians suffer disproportionately high suicide, alcohol, domestic violence ratesKillings were \u0026lsquoprobably\u0026rsquo retaliation for an earlier attack \u0026ndash Hela governorActivists not satisfied by Carrie Lam\u0026rsquos declaration that extradition Bill is \u0026lsquodead\u0026rsquoPeaceful campaigns and social media posts result in mysterious beatings, legal casesSeveral activists were left bloodied in the scuffles during latest extradition Bill protestsProtesters try to raise awareness among mainland Chinese visitors about political crisisRiot police baton-charge hundreds who refused to disperse following latest marchDemonstrations against extradition Bill have drawn millions to streets in recent weeks\u0026lsquoWe have nothing left to lose,\u0026rsquo shouted Hong Kong\u0026rsquos desperate, disenfranchised protestorsCharges relate to disruption of flag-raising ceremony rather than storming of legislature"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Tanker \u0026lsquoin full compliance with all navigation and international regulations\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash operatorSecond vessel seized and released, capture of both ships unacceptable, says Jeremy HuntDespite his Ben-Gurion identity, \u0026lsquoBibi\u0026rsquo faces bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust chargesTrump said US navy ship \u0026lsquodestroyed\u0026rsquo an Iranian drone in the Strait of HormuzThe woman is one of almost 1,700 victims of the highly contagious diseaseAnalysis: Washington\u0026rsquos goal is to shrink Iranian oil exports to zero and to isolate and deny Iran access to international tradeCrew detained for allegedly smuggling fuel from Iran amid heightened tensions in regionDefendants were accused of terrorist propaganda after guest-editing a newspaper on Kurdish issuesZaghari-Ratcliffe sentenced to five years in prison in 2016 after being accused of spyingNetanyahu disowns minister for education\u0026rsquos comments about discredited therapyRestive state faces prospect of being fractured into fiefdoms ruled by jihadi warlordsIncident occurs day after Iran spoke out over Britain intercepting supertankerPresident Hassan Rouhani says British operation was \u0026lsquovery cheap, wrong and a mistake\u0026rsquoUS will provide intelligence to coalition partners\u0026rsquo ships patrolling vulnerable waterwaysUS special envoy to Afghanistan winds up seventh round of talks amid signs of progressEmirati troops to leave Hodeidah port amid disagreement with Saudis over devastating warHuman Rights Watch calls on Baghdad to ensure humane treatment of detaineesEuropean powers express concern at move, although Tehran says position is \u0026lsquoreversible\u0026rsquoMove could eventually culminate in the return of all international sanctions on TehranEconomic crises in all three countries, plus chronic shortfalls in donor funding, are fuelling resentment among citizens with increased pressure on Syrians to leave"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3962896.1563642381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk denounces seizure of oil tanker by iran as a hostile act","story":"The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which was seized by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on Friday, is photographed in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday.

Britain also summoned the Iranian charge d’affaires in London.Legal processA spokesman for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Brigadier-General Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship in the Strait of Hormuz despite the “resistance and interference” of a British warship which had been escorting it. No British warship was visible in the video posted by the Guards.Iran’s Fars news agency said the Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored.The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. It would remain there with its 23 crew – 18 of them Indians – while the accident was investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organisation in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying.Zarif told Britain’s Hunt that the ship must go through a legal process before it could be released, Iran’s ISNA news agency reported.The strait, between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, is the sole outlet for exports of most Middle Eastern oil, and the seizure sent oil prices sharply higher. The United States, which tightened sanctions against Iran in May with the aim of halting its oil exports altogether, has been warning for months of an Iranian threat to shipping in the strait.France, Germany and the European Union joined Britain in condemning the seizure.The three big European countries are signatories to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers that Washington undermined by quitting last year, setting Iran’s already fragile relations with the West on a downward spiral.Under the pact, Iran agreed to restrict nuclear work in return for lifting sanctions. The European countries opposed the Trump administration’s decision to abandon the agreement last year, but have so far failed to fulfil promises to Iran of providing alternative means for it to access world trade.Extreme disappointment“Just spoke to . . . Zarif and expressed extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate situation, they have behaved in the opposite way,” tweeted British Foreign Secretary Hunt. “This has to be about actions not words if we are to find a way through.”Earlier he said London’s reaction would be “considered but robust”, and it would ensure the safety of its shipping.On Friday, Hunt said the solution would be found via diplomacy and London was “not looking at military options.” Britain’s government said it had advised British shipping to stay out of the Hormuz area for an interim period.The past three months of escalation have seen the United States and Iran come as close as ever to direct armed conflict. In June, Tehran shot down a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off just minutes before impact.In New Delhi, India’s foreign ministry said it was actively seeking the release of its nationals among the crew.Operator Stena Bulk said on Friday the tanker had been “in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”. On Saturday it said it was preparing a request to visit the crew.The vessel had been heading to a port in Saudi Arabia and suddenly changed course after passing through the strait.The United States has blamed Iran for a series of attacks on shipping around the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran rejects the allegations. Washington also said it had this week downed an Iranian drone near where the Stena Impero was seized.The United States is sending military personnel and resources to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Government to enshrine in law that NDAs cannot stop victims going to the police, lawyers or doctors Swedish prime minister warns Donald Trump he cannot influence ASAP Rocky judicial process\u0026#39The  of our democracy?\u0026#39 The Electoral Commission put me through hellBonhams withdraw ancient Greek drinking vessel from sale amid accusations it was excavated illegally Who\u0026#39s in, who\u0026#39s out?

Investigators are unsure if they have been misplaced, forgotten and left to gather dust in a storeroom, or stolen.In the past seven years, the Elysée has lodged 81 criminal complaints over the suspected theft of 122 sculptures, paintings or photographs, and 546 pieces of furniture and other objects, believed to be worth tens of thousands of pounds. A police source said: “There appears to be a shocking degree of carelessness in keeping track of things. These items weren’t taken from an auction house or a private apartment, but from the president’s official residences where security is extremely high. Investigators will be looking at whether they were stolen by staff.” Paris is notorious for art and jewellery thefts, but the disappearance of so many precious historical and cultural artefacts from official residences is embarrassing for the political establishment. Earlier this month police said they were investigating the suspected theft of seven works of art from the Elysée, but it has now emerged that many more have vanished.If crockery is included, the list of missing objects totals a staggering 57,165 items, with each saucer and cup counted inidually. A porcelain serving dish spotted on eBay in 2014 was identified as part of a set ordered by the President René Coty in the 1950s.The latest revelations follow a meticulous stocktaking exercise. Officials scrutinised presidential inventories of artworks and furnishings since the 19th century and checked them against what was found in the residences.Items have vanished from the Pavillon de la Lanterne, the president’s weekend retreat in Versailles,  Fort Brégançon on the Mediterranean, where Emmanuel Macron received Theresa May last summer, and several other state-owned châteaux and mansions used by the president, in addition to his main residence, the Elysée Palace.Thieves may have profited from a lack of detailed inventories for items such as dinner services, rugs and easily moveable furniture such as chairs.It was only in 2017 that a reliable inventory was finally drawn up after a five-year effort to trace missing items. Some 50 misplaced items were found. A bronze Louis XV chandelier thought to have been at the Elysée was found in a storeroom, and two sculptures that should have been at the Elysée were found in the Hôtel de Marigny, where the president receives visiting foreign dignitaries. Surveillance has now been tightened, with staffers obliged to sign a declaration listing every object found in their office when they take up their posts. When they leave, a second inventory is taken and the two are compared.The police source said: “The president’s office has often been slow to report suspected thefts to the police. It’s taken two years in some cases, which would have given thieves plenty of time to sell the objects without being noticed.”Brigitte Macron, the first lady, is keen to refresh the decor of the Elysée and her efforts to spruce up the palace have led to the replacement of a number of older furnishings and traditional artworks with contemporary oeuvres.Last year the Macrons became embroiled in a row over a new dinner service they ordered to replace the palace’s decades-old crockery, some of which dated back to the 1950s. The Elysée reported that it had cost €50,000 (nearly £45,000) but the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné said the true cost to taxpayers was closer to €500,000, which was the amount the state-subsidised factory would have charged private collectors for the same service.Government to enshrine in law that NDAs cannot stop victims going to the police, lawyers or doctors Swedish prime minister warns Donald Trump he cannot influence ASAP Rocky judicial process\u0026#39The  of our democracy?\u0026#39 The Electoral Commission put me through hellBonhams withdraw ancient Greek drinking vessel from sale amid accusations it was excavated illegally Who\u0026#39s in, who\u0026#39s out?

It was a miracle, and one made so powerful because it was so very unlikely.It was hailed as an incredible success.\u0026nbspBut the chance of failure was such that authorities had to prepare for the possibility of losing the astronauts.Those preparations offer a humbling insight into how risky that mission was, and how high the stakes were.Probably the most potent document from those preparations is the speech that would have been used to hail the bravery of the astronauts as they were left to their death on the Moon.It was written to announce to the world that the astronauts had been lost, and that the Moon mission was a failure. After it was read, the two astronauts would be given a ceremony something like the burial at sea, but one entirely without precedent.Created with Sketch.

But over time it became public, after being revealed by the man who wrote it, and is now available for the public to read.It was prepared in the case that the astronauts and their moon lander failed to get back to the main craft that was floating around in the Moon\u0027s orbit ready to bring them home, and contained Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s\u0026nbspcolleague Michael Collins.Everything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingIn that case, it was most likely that those pioneering explorers would not lose their lives in a single spectacular moment. Instead, they would most likely be stranded, stuck 250,000 miles from Earth with no way of getting back home.In the end, and despite some very anxious moments, the crew would explore the lunar surface and come back down safely. That meant that, instead of announcing their loss, Nixon could instead share in the astronaut\u0027s success.In one of the most famous moments of the mission, he spoke to them in a phone call that was beamed around the world. He recognised the triumph of their achievement, and wished them safety for their return.Hello, Neil and Buzz, he said during that phone call.\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can\u0027t tell you how proud we all are of what you\u0027ve done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognising what an immense feat this is.

They were a central part of a mission watched around the world, one which would define the century that followed, and which required intensive intelligence and ingenuity beyond our imagining\u0026nbsp– but at the moment they were engaged in housekeeping and sleeping.Now is the anniversary of perhaps the most unusual part of the Moon mission: that intermediate period after astronauts had completed the all-important liftoff, and as they waited, quietly drifting through space, on their way to the Moon.The launch happened on 16 July, 1969. The landing happened four days later, on 20 July.Between those days were a strange and eerie silence, filled with activities that would be humdrum were they not happening inside of the most ambitious activity ever launched by humankind.As the three astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins –\u0026nbspfloated serenely through space, they began to think about what would happen at Earth. They were travelling at immense speed which meant that they had left the Earth quicker than many of those who had come along to watch would be able to get out of the parking lots they\u0027d viewed it from.Created with Sketch.

Collins was assisted by his two colleagues to separate the command module from the third stage of the Saturn rocket, and then spin it around and connect with the lunar module known as Eagle that would be used to descend to the service.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketThis of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan, Aldrin later said.\u0026nbspIf the separation and docking did not work, we would return to Earth.There was also the possibility of an in-space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking proceeded perfectly to completion.The nose of Columbia was now connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver causing it to move slowly away from us.After that was completed, the really stressful work was over. The astronauts could get to sitting out the journey, waiting until they reached their distant target.By the next day, the astronauts were able to darken the windows with covers that served as curtains, and try and get some sleep as the command module slowly rotated them through space. They\u0027d spend the following days doing chores and talking with Earth.During those intermediate days, there was considerably less activity on board the craft. Nasa\u0027s official timeline – which gives detailed information on absolutely everything the crew did – lists only a few activities over the course of the 17th and 18th, as the three astronauts floated through space.On 17 July, for instance, the crew simply conducted three TV transmissions and did one small burn of their engines to correct their course. The day after, there was another TV transmission and a quick journey into the lunar module and back so that it could be inspected ahead of the landing.But the day later, as they approached the Moon and, the atmosphere would change.Day four\u0026nbsphas a decidedly different feel to it, Collins later said.\u0026nbspInstead of nine hours\u0027 sleep, I get seven –\u0026nbspand fitful ones at that.Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way to the Moon, the pressure is overtaking us (or me at least), and I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line.At this point, everything became much more real: for one, the astronauts could once again see the Moon properly for the first time in nearly a day. They were now in orbit around the Moon, and it was vividly clear.The Moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional small yellow disk in the sky, has gone away somewhere, to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen, said Collins later.To begin with it is huge, completely filling our window. Second, it is three-dimensional. The belly of it bulges out\u0026nbsptoward\u0026nbspus in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can reach out and touch it. To add to the dramatic effect, we can see the stars again. We are in the shadow of the Moon now, and the elusive stars have reappeared.At this point, the work to get ready to touch the lunar surface begins. The astronauts each carry out the checks that would try and ensure that the descent was as safe as possible, and that the lander that would carry them down was as secure as it could possibly be.Collins would spent yet more time on his own, waiting, as Aldrin and Armstrong jumped around the lunar surface. As they did, he waited, floating above the Moon – occasionally disappearing behind it and being plunged into the all-consuming quiet of the far side of the Moon –\u0026nbspand waiting for his two colleagues to make their return, before heading back to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She\u0026nbspalso believes in charging upwards of £10K for her\u0026nbspservicesClick to followThe IndependentIt wasn’t long ago that using a dating agency could mark you as an undesirable, perhaps even a weirdo. But with the rise of the internet, using a third party to find love has become a commonplace, even preferred, method of finding a partner.\u0026nbspThis rush to find love online has, some argue, reduced the dating process to a superficial transaction. For some, the romance and ritual of dating has been lost and there is at least one introduction agency that still believes in personal contact, romance and good old-fashioned manners. It also believes in charging upwards of £10K for its services.Berkeley International was set up by Mairead Molloy in 2003 to provide a high end, personal introduction service to the wealthy.\u0026nbspAnd although she welcomes the normalisation of finding love in this way, she does seem to hanker after a pre-social media world where, she believes, people were just… nicer.“The first couple of years of operating were easier than they are now because people were nicer, more mannerly, easier to deal with and more respectful. People were more tolerant and less bitchy,” she says.\u0026nbspWhilst it might be easy to dismiss Molloy and Berkeley International as a throw-back to the days of submitting dating profiles via VHS cassette, the company has grown from one office in 2003 to a global network across 13 countries turning over £1m annually.\u0026nbspSo, there’s clearly a market for its services and, according to Molloy, it’s not the preserve of “the twin pearls set” with clients on her books as young as 22 and mature as 88 years old. They are a mix of entrepreneurs, inherited wealth, self-starters and celebrities.\u0026nbspA demanding clientele for sure but one that Mairead seems to revel in managing.Growing up in County Wexford in Ireland, she studied hotel management before setting up and ultimately selling a software company before, on a whim, buying a hotel in Cannes, where she still lives. That venture lasted four and half years before she once again sold up and accepted the role of Global Director at a fledgling Berkeley International.What’s it like to work as a matchmaker?It was whilst setting up Berkeley International that she took a degree in psychology and a Masters in criminology redefining herself as a relationship psychologist along the way.\u0026nbspIt’s not clear whether she is a natural people person, or if the psychology training has given her the skills, but she is able to disarm and engage the person in front of her effortlessly. “When someone comes in, you have to paint an absolutely honest version of reality. All we can do is give you advice, introduce you to the best possible people that we can and by process of elimination, and through your feedback, try and pinpoint the best person for you.”\u0026nbspWhich sounds straightforward enough but when people have shelled out tens of thousands of pounds and not met their match, they tend to turn to the supplier for recompense.This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someoneA 2018 court case involving premium dating agency, Seventy Thirty, shows just how wrong it can go. The agency was ordered by the courts to refund Tereza Burki’s £13,000 membership fee after she was unable to find a suitable match through their services. Ms Burki was in turn told to pay Seventy Thirty £5,000 in libel damages for posting an online review describing the company a scam. All very messy and undignified. So how does Molly ensure that Berkeley does not find itself dragged into a similarly unseemly situation?“I don’t think the ruling against Seventy-Thirty was justified – I think it was brutally unfair,” she says.\u0026nbsp“These people come into introduction agencies and pay money and they have this idea in their head that they are going to meet their prince or princess charming – they are deluded.“What you should do is come in with an open mind and treat the people who are looking after you with respect and accept the dates that are arranged based on the criteria you have provided. This business is all about humour and personality and being able to laugh at yourself – if you can do that, you’re going to meet someone.”Man sues elite matchmaker after spending $426,000 on six datesBerkeley has three options for the lovelorn – membership which provides access to the UK client base, an equivalent that broadens the search across Europe and further afield and a bespoke service where matches are ‘headhunted’ on behalf of a client.\u0026nbspTravelling around the world, headhunting that elusive inidual to complete the life of a wealthy inidual (“never an English person, always European or international and generally a man in his early 50s or woman in her mid-to late 30s”), must mean Molloy has had to leave her Wexford roots behind and join a global elite.“I live in a simple world,” she insists.\u0026nbsp“I don’t live in a fancy house or drive a fancy car. I like a fried egg sandwich, watching Coronation Street on the phone to my mother. The world of wealth and fame doesn’t bother me. It’s not me, it’s what I do.”\u0026nbspThis is reflected in her desires for the future. Aside from desperately wanting to appear on the Graham Norton show, “I just want to go to India and not give a sh*t about nothing.” She quickly admits that she couldn’t do that forever. She needs to be doing something.\u0026nbspAnd for now, that something is continuing to kick against the transactional approach to dating that chafes so much and bring romance, personality and love back to the world of dating. At a price.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s right, it doesn’t38 Boot doesn’t match the boot printThe print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we’re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong.48 No stars in outer space?Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun.58 Astronauts couldn’t survive the radiation beltsThe Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth’s magnetic field.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm.

Now, the\u0026nbspspace agency is looking to put the first woman\u0026nbspand the next man on the lunar surface in 2024.“Being able to write that next chapter, knowing what has come before through Apollo and the shuttle programme, and knowing we are writing that next story is amazing.\u0026nbspIt is humbling to think about what they were able to do... especially considering they didn’t have the computing power we do,” she says. “That we are even in the same conversation... is incredible.”Spellman should know what the Apollo missions took, she works with veterans of that programme and while Nasa has had to build on that expertise over the past five decades the principles of that era-defining trip underpin\u0026nbspeverything she does.\u0026nbspThe current mission, called Artemis,\u0026nbspthe sister of Apollo, is daunting in itself. Having been set the task of returning to the moon in 2028, Donald Trump’s administration has\u0026nbspaccelerated that timeline. Vice-president Mike Pence said back in March that the later deadline was “just not good enough” and that “urgency must be our watch word”.While that may have something to do with that date being\u0026nbspthe end of a notional second term for Trump, the non-partisan Nasa is taking it in its stride.\u0026nbsp“It gets me really excited. I’m\u0026nbspexcited that we now have this really clear goal of boots on the moon by 2024...

A veteran of the 1960s effort, Poimboeuf said earlier this month: “This place is history in the making and it’s not over yet.”“It is not going to happen overnight... but it is comforting to know we are going through some of the same growing pains,” she adds.NasaEPA)Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy space centre in Florida has seen its fair share of history beyond Apollo, having also been used in the space shuttle programme from 1981 to 2011 – but its latest guise is unprecedented. It will now accommodate Nasa’s heavy-duty Space Launch System (SLS), which will power the crew-carrying Orion capsule into the heavens.\u0026nbspAs an example of the sheer magnitude of the changes, more than 1.3 million feet of copper\u0026nbspwiring used in the Apollo era has\u0026nbsphad to be switched to fibre optics.\u0026nbsp“It is a pivotal time for us – we are now testing the mobile launchpad and the launcher together so we are building up the system... we are getting really close to that first mission.” An unmanned test flight of Orion is due next year, with a crewed test to follow in 2022.What happened as astronauts headed towards the MoonApollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketEverything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionBeyond Florida and the Nasa centres across the US, the elements around the mission are fraught. Some members of congress, who have to sign off the budget for Artemis, are wary of the costs and the few details provided so far.\u0026nbsp“We have a White House directive to land humans on the Moon in five years, but no plan, and no budget details on how to do so,” Kendra Horn,\u0026nbspchair of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said back in May just before a 2020 budget was announced. That budget called for an extra $1.6bn\u0026nbspto fund Artemis for that fiscal year, on top of the $21bn\u0026nbspthe president already requested for Nasa.Costs for the following years are yet to be established but will rise, with estimates that Artemis could cost $20bn\u0026nbspto $30bn or more in total.\u0026nbsp“You are sort of asking congress to put a down payment on a car, but you don’t know what you are buying and you don’t know how much it will cost,” says Dr Mary Lynne Dittmar, who has decades of experience in the space field and is part of the Users’ Advisory Group of the National Space Council – the body reestablished by Trump under the direction of\u0026nbspPence to help guide policy.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsptold a Senate panel\u0026nbspon Wednesday that a budget impasse and subsequent spending freeze later this year would be devastating for the chances of the Artemis mission.However,\u0026nbspwith the mission looking to set down roots for “national capability for decades” rather than just two or three trips to the moon,\u0026nbspDittmar believes it is a “different ball game” to the “war footing” of the 1960s space race. Later space missions in the 1970s and 1980s were “trying to apply a model that was specific to that one point in time... now it is a much different landscape”. More infrastructure and more countries are involved – which means the conversations over how missions will take place and what is needed will take longer.Dittmar does not doubt the political will to put humans back on the moon, but the pressure of the deadline means that things have to happen relatively quickly. Recent staff changes at the top of Nasa, initiated by those within the agency, may indicate that the urgency created by the White House is having an effect.In his speech in March, Pence raised the prospect of the use of commercial rockets to keep the mission on schedule. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” he said. There are certainly advocates who believe this is the right strategy and it could reduce costs.\u0026nbspCharles Miller, who was part of the Trump administration’s transition team for Nasa in 2017 and was senior adviser for commercial space at Nasa from 2009 to 2012, believes that such partnerships between Nasa and outside companies are “fundamental”.\u0026nbsp“Artemis is an opportunity to have a complete break with the failed space policies of the last couple of decades... to open up the solar system in a way that is completely affordable and could be transformational,” he says.Why some people still believe that we never went to the Moon“If we go back to the moon in the way Trump wants and the way Obama did before him, by leveraging commercial partnerships, it can also be much faster and be of much more benefit to the world,” he adds. Miller, who is a serial space entrepreneur, says that if billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are putting up capital and so “have skin in the game” it is a win-win, even if there have been some failures in the past.I think the overall strategy the Nasa administration wants to execute will succeed, the only question is when... The old model of the ‘big costs and aerospace needs’ is on the verge of collapse,” he says.Dittmar, who is also chief executive\u0026nbspfor the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a trade group of more than 65 companies, sees things differently. She believes the space market needs to be at a tipping point where investors and company shareholders see the potential for returns and we might not be there yet.\u0026nbsp“I think public-private partnerships have a place, yes. Do I think it is a panacea? No,” she says,\u0026nbspalthough it is more likely the market may be in shape by the time Nasa is looking at heading to Mars once the Artemis mission is complete.\u0026nbspFor Dittmar, who was involved with work on the International Space Station (ISS), the implications of the Artemis mission are beyond business or even the limited scope that the Trump White House is projecting.\u0026nbspShe is looking for American leadership in space and being able to “keep the door open for others”. More than 100 countries have been involved in the various facets of the ISS mission both on the ground and in space and such cooperation will be crucial to make the most of the moon mission and beyond.Nasa\u0027s next great mission to the moonDittmar remembers the 1969 landing and says that it represents “one of the shining moments in humanity on par with figuring out the Magna Carta”. But the full impact may not be felt for generations and it is the same with the new mission.\u0026nbsp“I do believe that other nations are going to be watching and thinking ‘what does this mean for us?’” she says. “Inspiration is not just public inspiration its inspiration in engineering, in technology development.”“We are also going to learn about ourselves as human beings – being challenged by new environments,” Dittmar adds.Inspiration for the next generation is a key motive for Spellman, who has a young son.\u0026nbsp“We want this reality of working in maths and science to hit kids all over the world,” she says. “Now there is so much access to what we are doing – can you imagine the live feed coming from the moon and kids watching that? It will put it at the fingertips of children across the world and make it real to them that they could do something like this.”In fact, Spellman hopes the Artemis mission will provide a cultural touchstone for everyone.\u0026nbsp“I hope the mission brings us all together, for at least\u0026nbspa moment,” she says. When you think about everyone sitting around watching their televisions or listening on the radio when Neil Armstrong was taking the steps on the moon, it would be great to have that moment again.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unlikely alliances have formed. Improbable heroes and villains have emerged.One of the most extraordinary transformations\u0026nbsphas been\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, whose shift\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbsployal chancellor to no-deal critic and then backbench rebel is nearly complete.“Spreadsheet Phil” – as he is sometimes known in Westminster – has spent nearly a decade at the top of government, precisely because he is seen as reliable, measured\u0026nbspand probably a little dull.But those days appear to be over. Over the past few months, Mr Hammond has been increasingly outspoken about\u0026nbspthe economic risks of a no-deal Brexit, something he fears is not being given serious consideration by Brexiteers.His disquiet\u0026nbsphas been more apparent since Boris Johnson stormed in front in\u0026nbspthe Conservative leadership contest with his repeated promises to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 49Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Steve Messam poses next to his monumental landscape artwork \u0027Hush\u0027 which hangs in the moors of Teesdale on July 18, 2019 in Barnard Castle, England.

Mr Hammond not only abstained on the vote but he actively\u0026nbspwanted people to know he had done so.Hammond-led plot to sink no deal could kill off Johnson’s Brexit plansHe\u0026nbsptweeted:\u0026nbsp“It should not be controversial to believe that parliament be allowed to sit, and have a say, during a key period in our country’s history.”Mr Hammond seems to be at the head of an unlikely bunch of Tory rebels, a gaggle of sensible ministers who cannot get behind Mr Johnson’s demand to keep no deal on the table.Pro-EU ministers Greg Clark, the business secretary, Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, and justice secretary David Gauke\u0026nbspalso abstained, which suggests they know they are on their way out as well.It has been suggested that Mr Hammond played a key role in organising the rebellion, sending encouraging text messages to Tory ministers and urging them to abstain.\u0026nbspThe defeat is a taste of what prime minister\u0026nbspJohnson faces over the coming months.Ms May had a tough\u0026nbsptime trying to contend with the Brexiteers snapping at her heels, but Mr Johnson will have to go up against a\u0026nbspbunch of radicalised former cabinet ministers, who command the respect of plenty of Tory MPs.Mr Hammond has even suggested he might be prepared to bring down the government should the new PM push for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Grieve and former chancellor Ken Clarke have also said they would consider such a move.If the Tories lose a by-election on Wales next month, the government’s working majority would be reduced to three – leaving Mr Johnson with almost no room for manoeuvre.If Mr Hammond becomes a “nightmare on the backbenches”, as he joked at a Treasury party earlier this month, then\u0026nbspMr Johnson may find delivering Brexit as difficult as his predecessor.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspremediation efforts have stalled.More than 50,000 people are estimated to still be living in buildings that have been deemed as unsafe.The latest revelation came after the government admitted that the scale of the cladding crisis is much bigger than first thought.It had long been known that ACM panels were unsafe for use on highrise buildings, but on Thursday ministers announced that a second type of cladding had also been found to be highly flammable.It is not known how many blocks are covered in the second type of panel, called high-pressure laminate (HPL), but hundreds more buildings are likely to be affected.Advice issued by the government\u0026nbspsaid that “action to remediate unsafe HPL systems should be carried out as soon as possible”.Created with Sketch.Grenfell fire remembered two years on: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Grenfell United project a message

anniversary of the Grenfell fire Further suspect types of cladding have yet to be tested, suggesting the problem could be greater still.Ministers announced this week that they wanted to see ACM cladding removed from all social sector buildings by December 2019 and all private sector buildings by June 2020.Currently just 1.25 private sector residential blocks on average are having ACM cladding removed each month, compared to an average of 3.5 for social sector blocks.This suggests that, at the current rate, the social sector work will only be completed in December 2021, and the private sector work not until May 2030.Facing pressure to do more to speed up the removal of dangerous materials, the government announced a £200m fund earlier this year to help private building owners remove ACM cladding, but critics said the money would not go far enough.As well as setting the new targets, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said the government is considering punishing private block owners who are still refusing to take the cladding down after the end of this year.Labour said private blocks should be “confiscated” if owners refuse to comply and called on the government to do more to support owners who are struggling to cover the costs of removing the materials.Grenfell victimsSarah Jones, the party’s shadow housing minister, said: “The government has at long last set a deadline to remove ACM cladding, but at the current pace of work they will miss that target by a whole decade.“Ministers need to step in and help councils who are struggling to get this work done promptly. And they must clarify what enforcement action they will take against private block owners who fail to make their buildings safe. Labour has been clear that sanctions should include confiscation of blocks where necessary.“We now know that ACM is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cladding scandal. Now the government has admitted HPL cladding is deadly, we urgently need answers on how many more buildings are covered in flammable materials and how quickly it will be removed.”Health chiefs ‘showed troubling lack of urgency over Grenfell cough’ Huge crowd marches in silence on second anniversary of Grenfell blazeSafety fears at scorched Barking flats ‘first raised after Grenfell’Matt Wrack,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the FBU, said:\u0026nbsp“The glacial speed of progress removing the very same flammable cladding as was on Grenfell Tower is simply shameful. To see so little progress removing dangerous cladding over the last month sums up the government’s half-hearted approach to public safety.“Despite the government’s own tests proving that high-pressure laminate cladding is not safe, they have made no commitment to remediation work. It’s as though they are waiting to see another tragic loss of life before they will protect the thousands at risk from other forms of flammable cladding.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We expect all building owners, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to complete remediation within six months of agreeing a plan – by June 2020 – or they will face enforcement action.“Owners are responsible for the safety of their buildings and it’s unacceptable if they are not moving quickly to remedy this problem – which is why the government has made £600m\u0026nbspavailable to pay for remediation and remove cost as a barrier to progress.“Ensuring the safety of residents still living in buildings with unsafe ACM cladding is a priority.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we are well on our way to getting this done.”A module manufactured by Airbus in Bremen, Germany, that will power Orion during the mission, is in the process of being attached ready for a September flight to test its spaceworthiness.Mr Pence announced in March that NASA should return astronauts to the moon by 2024, halving the agency’s previous deadline to get there by 2028, and requested an extra $1.6bn funding from Congress.Relive the moon landing 50 years onThe moon landing showed us that nothing was impossibleHow moon landing conspiracy theories shaped our worldElon Musk says SpaceX can land astronauts on the moon within two yearsHowever, President Donald Trump on Friday indicated he was not interested in a mission going back to the moon.Mr Trump instead repeated his interest in a NASA mission that would take astronauts directly to Mars, a vastly more challenging and costly endeavour.“To get to Mars, you have to land on the moon, they say. Any way of going directly without landing on the moon? Is that a possibility?” the president asked Mr Bridenstine during an event in the Oval Office.Mr Bridenstine responded:\u0026nbsp”Well, we need to use the moon as a proving ground, because when we go to Mars, we’re going to have to be there for a long period of time, so we need to learn how to live and work on another world.”The Artemis program’s objective is to conduct a series of manned and unmanned missions to the moon, using its surface as a proving ground for technologies that could lay the groundwork for the longer and more complex missions to Mars as soon as 2033, Mr Bridenstine has said.Agencies contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were about five or six homes burning and firefighters were trying to save the houses near to those that were on fire. The heat from the fire was so intense that the firefighter could only stand near the burning building for 10-15 seconds before having to move away - Justin SullivanThis was only one of several large-scale forest fires in Brandenburg state in Germany last year, following droughts which left the forests in the region extremely dry. The year set a new record for fires that burned over 400 hectares. As a photojournalist covering the region for over 15 years, I now have to assume either drought or floods will very likely be a part of the news we will be covering every summer - Sean GallupThis photograph was taken at a sunflower field at Goersdorf near Golssen in Germany. The farmers in the region are really despairing. In the years before many faced floods, in 2018 it was scorching heat. Many grow crops that are meant to feed their cows, so when the crops fail they need to buy feed. With the price of milk so low many are fearing for their economic survival if weather cycles like this continue - Sean GallupOn the third day of the Camp Fire the flames had moved away from the town and were burning in the nearby hills. I captured this photo in Big Bend, as the story was shifting away from the fire itself and focusing on trying to locate missing persons and recover remains of those who had perished - Justin SullivanYou can see the Belchatow power plant and the rising steam and smoke from over 20km away. I went there the day before the start of the United Nations’ climate conference in Katowice, which took place in a region where coal has a long history and coal mining is woven into local tradition. I stayed the night at an alpine hut near the Waxeggkees glacier in Austria. An employee I talked to at night said, sometimes (this was August) she heard the sounds of ice breaking off the glacier and crashing across rocks. 100 years ago the glacier would have filled the photo.

That may or may not be enough to form a one-party majority. But by week’s end, the 41-year-old will almost certainly enjoy a commanding position over the main towers of Ukrainian political power.\u0026nbspIn the process, the Supreme Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, will be transformed, with as many as three-quarters of the intake green to high politics.\u0026nbspSunday’s vote is not without major intrigue. How Zelensky and others perform will determine not only the composition of his coalition, but also that of his cabinet and premier. Ukraine has a complicated mixed first-past-the-post and PR system, with 226 seats needed for an outright majority. Unlike many other post-Soviet countries, the parliament is a serious player, with powers to appoint ministers and even to impeach the president.\u0026nbspAhead of possible negotiations, Zelensky has already ruled out a deal with the leading pro-Russian party Opposition Platform For Life, whose leaders were this week hosted in Moscow by Vladimir Putin. But it is far from clear that his preferred coalition partner choice – Holos, a new party fronted by singer Sviatoslav Vakarchuk – will break the 5 per cent\u0026nbspparliamentary barrier. That may force the rookie president into a pact with the party of Ukraine’s craftiest politician, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\u0026nbspThe election comes at a historical moment for Ukraine, with a poll revealing for the first time that a majority are hopeful their country is headed in the right direction. Volodymyr Paniotto, Ukraine’s most experienced poll-watcher, says voters remain largely amenable to their new president.\u0026nbspCan Zelensky’s popularity help his party in Ukraine’s elections?Candidates polling for his party in first-past-the-post districts receive on average a 10-15 per cent boost, he told The Independent. Sometimes, but not always, this is enough to overtake incumbents, who have historically spent to woo voters with playgrounds, sausages and buckwheat.\u0026nbspWhatever happens, Zelensky can certainly look back on a successful campaign. Most of the time, his team played things safe. They produced a centrist programme, mixing uncontroversial policies – though little mention was ever made of it. They avoided any questioning on provocative issues such as high communal charges. They shunned traditional media in favour of posts on Facebook and Instagram.\u0026nbspThe most talked-about interview of election week was in fact done by an\u0026nbspMP3 file, with the president answering a dozen pre-recorded questions as he drove around Kiev in a Tesla. One and a half million watched the video. \u0026nbspZelensky also found an effective, if more old-school election tool in admonishing bureaucrats in public. In the past ten days, he has ridiculed customs officials on the western border, forced a tax chief in Odessa to sign a resignation letter in front of him, and ordered another official out of the room, calling him a “gangster” for effect. Voters have lapped up the strongman image, says Paniotto, and it has allowed him to reverse a dip in the polls.\u0026nbspBut Zelensky’s use of populist mechanisms should come with a warning, says the political philosopher Mikhail Minakov. After all, it was first popularised by a certain Alexander Lukashenko, the president leader next door, who wasted no time turning Belarus into an authoritarian regime.\u0026nbsp“What worries me is that there won’t be strong enough opposition to Zelensky,” Minakov tells The Independent. “This new intake may be fresh, but they will be less competent too.”\u0026nbspVolodymyr Zelensky vows to dissolve parliament in inauguration addressAnother takeaway from the polling is that voters have moved further away from the previous president. Since April, Petro Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party has seen its projected result go from double digits to barely breaking the parliamentary barrier of 5 per cent. It can be assumed that Poroshenko will not be invited into the coalition given the sharp words directed at Zelensky during the presidential campaign.\u0026nbspOlga Onukh, an associate professor at Manchester University, says Poroshenko oversaw a misguided retreat into safe, nationalistic leaning heartlands in western Ukraine.\u0026nbsp“All the data tells us that you can’t win elections without winning votes in central or eastern Ukraine,” she said. “Poroshenko didn’t begin to address their bread-and-butter needs. He didn’t address the fact that people have got poorer over the last five\u0026nbspyears. He didn’t tell them he felt their pain.”\u0026nbspUkraine was not the only nation whose elite has become disconnected from the people, the academic adds. Similar processes were “observable across the world”. But in Ukraine the dangers of a negative outcome were obvious.“This is a landscape-shifting election for Ukraine,” she said. “But the worry is that given the disconnect and the impossible expectations, people will turn to less attractive options if things don’t work out.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Serena Williams in action during her second round match against Japan\u0027s Kurumi Nara. The 23-time grand slam winner went through to the next round 6-3, 6-2The reported Iranian position\u0026nbspin this is confusing at the moment. Mr Hunt stated that Mr Zarif had told him the Steno Impero had been captured in “tit-for-tat” for Grace 1.However, Tehran has also said the tanker had been detained after colliding with a fishing boat and then refusing to stop. An arrest was carried out under international law and the ship taken to the port of Bandar Abbas, according to the country’s official news agency. The issue of the Gibraltar seizure does not feature in this version.UK tanker was seized by Iran in Oman waters, says defence secretaryCorbyn blames Trump for fuelling Iran crisis after UK tanker seizedIran releases video to dismiss US claims that drone shot down Everything we know about the British ship seized by IranThe foreign secretary has pointed out that the UK has tried to de-escalate the situation with offers of talks to release Grace 1 and its cargo of oil in return for assurances the oil would not be taken to Syria.Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, confirmed that a Royal Navy frigate was an hour from the scene when Iranian forces took over the Stena Impero which, she insisted, was in Omani waters at the time.The Royal Navy currently has a frigate, with another one about to arrive, four mine-hunters and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship stationed near the Gulf along with Royal Marines.\u0026nbspBut the message from London was that military action was not being contemplated.Mr Hunt had declared there would be robust\u0026nbspaction if the British tanker was not released. But he also stressed that this did not include the use of armed forces.He said on Saturday evening that he would\u0026nbspmake a statement to the Commons on Monday which, unless something dramatic happens\u0026nbspin the next 24 hours, appears to suggest that the Marines are not about to storm Bandar Abbas.The French and German foreign ministries condemned the Iranian seizure of the tanker. Emmanuel Macron’s government said such an action harmed de-escalation efforts in the region, while\u0026nbspAngela Merkel’s office stated it was an unjustifiable intrusion\u0026nbspon shipping through a key shipping route and urged Iran to release the ship and crew.Looming over all this is the shadow of Mr Trump. The American dispatch of troops, Patriot missiles and a squadron of F-22 warplanes to Saudi Arabia looks like yet another ratcheting up of the confrontation.But the US president also confirmed on Friday that he had appointed senator Rand Paul to negotiate with Iran to reduce tension, contradicting, in typical Trump fashion, what he had said 24 hours earlier on the matter.The Paul appointment is important. The senator has been a consistent advocate against American military adventures abroad, albeit from a right-wing perspective. He would be a counterweight to John Bolton, the national security advisor who, like Mr Trump, is a Vietnam draft dodger, but has been consistent advocate of US military intervention and has, in the past, spoken of his desire for regime change in Iran.Mr Paul has also been among those in Congress who had attempted to block the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia –\u0026nbspsomething which runs totally counter to Mr Trump’s position on the issue.So there are now contradictory and confusing messages from Tehran and Washington in a highly volatile situation.Britain, which is trying along with France, Germany, Russian and China to save the Iran nuclear deal the Trump administration is trying to destroy, risks being sucked into a scenario where build-up of military hardware in the Gulf could trigger a conflict –\u0026nbspthe ever-present risk in such situations of the law of unintended consequences.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seeing him inciting the crowd back in 1995 against the media, which really we see in Trump in 2016.“When you look back at how he operates, there is almost no chance of anyone combating him. He is so good at it. He is so sharp.”Fast-forward two decades and\u0026nbspNetanyahu, or “Bibi” as he is nicknamed, is still in office and remains\u0026nbspvery much a\u0026nbspmaster of social media.Although he lost the 1999 elections, the former soldier and diplomat would storm to power again on the heels of the 2009 war with militants in Gaza. He kept winning, securing a fourth consecutive term in office in April this year.In fact on Saturday this winning streak will make history, as he becomes Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, limping past the country’s founding father David Ben Gurion who served 4,875 days in office.His recent win came\u0026nbspdespite the fact\u0026nbspNetanyahu was campaigning under the shadow of indictment across three corruption cases, and\u0026nbspin just a few months faces the prospect of becoming Israel’s first serving prime minister to stand trial.Netanyahu accused of ‘spin’ after backing bid to scrap snap electionsIn a long line of firsts, Israel is also due to go back to the ballot box in September less than six\u0026nbspmonths after\u0026nbspthe last polls. Fresh elections were called when\u0026nbspNetanyahu could not form a new coalition government.Despite this,\u0026nbspas a caretaker premier, Netanyahu celebrated 13 years in office defiantly.“We have turned Israel into a rising global power,” he said in a special interview with Israeli daily Israel Hayom.“We have proven that Israel could be transformed from a small country in the corner of the Middle East into a major force on the global stage,” he added.He has maintained solid approval ratings, and although the latest polls show he may fail again to put together a coalition government, is still the favourite to win the September elections.Former advisers, observers and critics all agree he is a master in unstatesmanlike statesmanship.Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife Sara admits to misuse of public fundsTrump sends map to Netanyahu showing Golan Heights as part of IsraelAnalysis: Will this be the end for Netanyahu?Israel calls snap election just one month after last voteNetanyahu’s wife gets plea bargain in meals fraud caseHe has delivered to a right-wing majority Israel what it wants: a transformed, powerful economy\u0026nbspand comparative security despite two wars with Gaza, and the threat of conflict with Iran\u0026nbspand the forces it backs in Syria and Lebanon.“Over the past 10-year period it’s been pretty stable. We have ties with China, Russia, the Gulf,” says Anshel Pfeffer, author of Bibi, the Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.Meanwhile support for him within his right-wing Likud party is “unprecedented”,\u0026nbspPfeffer adds. \u0026nbspThere are many reasons for that.For a start,\u0026nbspPfeffer says the leader has a “unique” talent at leveraging small majorities to build coalitions\u0026nbspagainst the so-called “threat of the left”.“He manages to make settlers, immigrants, the ultra-Orthodox and the secular nationalists fit together in this coalition of outsiders.”Netanyahu has successfully batted off all potential rivals within his party including Avigdor Lieberman, Moshe Kahlon, Naftali Bennet and Ayelet Shaked, all former Likud members who broke away to build rival parties but have failed to form winning teams.Netanyahu celebrates his 1996 win he\u0026nbspreceived\u0026nbsp50.4 per cent of the vote to Shimon-Peres’s 49.5 per cent (Reuters)He has also impressively point-scored over his last term.Since the 2016 election of President Donald Trump, whose campaign style appears inspired by\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s delivery, the US has moved its embassy to Jerusalem, recognising the contested city as Israel’s capital.Washington has also recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, slashed all aid to the UN’s Palestinian aid agency and trashed the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, all key Netanyahu demands.Jared Kushner,\u0026nbspTrump’s son-in-law, delivered the first tranche of a regional peace deal last month which successfully avoided all references to a Palestinian state as a solution to the conflict, another key demand of the Israeli right.In fact, Netanyahu has proudly resisted various peace initiatives and allowed controversial West Bank settlements, which are illegal under international law, to flourish.He managed to “empty” the long-term left-wing battle cry that not resolving the Israel-Palestinian crisis would lead to total isolation, Pfeffer continues.“In that moment it seemed he could do anything, showing how far he had come.”And that is why at rallies people have taken to chanting “magician” at him.“He thinks that ... he is the one who will save Israel and lead Israel to a safe haven,” Aviv Bushinsky, a former Netanyahu aide, recently told\u0026nbspthe Associated Press. Israelis think that “things are good, so why should we change a winning horse,” he added.That said, many feel that this may be a period of calm before the storm.Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, agrees\u0026nbspthat while Netanyahu’s political longevity might be seen as a success story, “it may also be that ... we will remember him more for leading Israel down the road to more oppression of the Palestinians”.Filmmaker Shadur says: “It is difficult to pin down what defines his time in office.” Unlike his predecessors, Netanyahu has not left his mark by winning a war or signing a peace agreement.“It may be he will be responsible for a certain stagnation which will lead to a disintegration.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I got up first to leave home at am. I gave her a kiss on the lips. She was half asleep and mumbled, ‘I love you’. I’m so pleased I did that.“She messaged me at .am, joking, ‘How about less of the ­early-morning kisses on the lips ’ I had no idea that would be her last message to me. I called her a bit later that morning to find out how the check-up went but I got no response to WhatsApp or calls, which was unlike her.“When I called the clinic and they said she’d not turned up to her appointment, I started to panic.“I called her family, we called AE departments and the police but no one had heard from her.“I got on my bike and headed back towards our flat. On the way I saw the accident and all the roads blocked off. I had a sinking feeling.“I asked a policemanit was a woman called Emily on a scooter andthey were seriously injured.“He said he would send two senior policeman to see me.“They started walking towards me and time just seemed to stop. I kind of knew. Then they said, ‘It’s not good news. I’m just going to say it. I’m afraid she’s dead’.”Emily, a campaigner on mental health issues and YouTube influencer who had , Instagram followers, died at .am after colliding with a lorry. The machines are illegal on public roads and pavements.Jake, , says Emily “knew the risks” about riding the battery-powered device, which had a top speed of mph. He said: “It was a ­terrible accident which has left a hole in our lives.“Emily was the most beautul person I’ve ever met.“We had just moved in together and were planning a family. I’m heartbroken she has gone. I initially bought her a standard scooter for her birthday but it was on her wish-list to have an electric one, so I got it for her.“She was so excited about it and loved using it. But she was always safe, wore a helmet and was ­conscientious on the roads.“We didn’t know they couldn’t be used on the roads, as police would go past all the time and not stop her.“People have told me I’m to blame because I bought it for her, but I can’t think that.“Her family have told me I’m not. I don’t think they should be banned for adults, as they are electric, go a maximum of mph and don’t do any harm to the environment. They’re not that dferent to bicycles.“What’s needed is a move to make drivers more aware these things are on the roads. Kids should not be allowed on them. They are not toys. Losing my beautul Emily — the woman I wanted to spend my le with — is proof of that.”Jake, Emily’s sisters and her close friends are determined to ­continue her work raising awareness of mental health issues via social media and by running groups for sufferers in her memory.Jake said: “Since her death I’ve had thousands of people contact me to say what a dference she made to mental health sufferers by encouraging them to talk about it.“We’re determined to keep that going. My le was Emily and that’s not going to change.”Jake met Emily when he started working at the gym she used in Farringdon, North London, in April .He said: “It was my first day. This beautul woman strolled up to me and said, ‘Who’s this new person ’ We hit it off straight away.“We have both suffered from mental health issues and we really opened up to each other.“Emily had an amazing ability to put you at ease. She never judged you, and made things that might be taboo feel normal.“We loved the same things — the cinema, eating food out, exercise and going on holidays.“I’ll never forget our first holiday to Mexico, when she told me for the first time that she loved me. It will stay with me forever.“She always talked about our relationship in our YouTube videos.“Followers of them will know we were planning to have a baby and she was getting her eggs frozen.“It was typical of Emily. She really knew what she wanted.”Around , Brits own electric scooters, including Olympic er Tom Daley, .They typically cost between £ and £ and can travel at speeds of more than mph.Just days after Emily’s death, a -year-old boy from Beckenham, South East London, was left in a critical condition after a scooter crash on a busy road.Since then, some people have called for a ban.Jake surprised Emily on her birthday with the electric scooter that she had wanted for months.He said: “I couldn’t say no. I bought her a Xiaomi scooter because it was one of the most reliable.“She got a gold helmet to use with it on her commute to work, which was only  minutes. She even posted a video of me, her and the scooter on YouTube. She was proud of it.”Jake — a motorbike enthusiast who does not own a scooter — said his relationship with Emily had never been stronger than when they moved in together on July .He said: “Looking back, I’m so pleased we got those special last days together.“With us trying for a baby and living together, it felt like everything was going right.“In the last days she got me hooked on Love Island.“I don’t think I’ll ever watch it again.”Emily died in Battersea, South London, less than a mile from the home they shared.Police told Jake a fellow road user had caught the incident on his GoPro camera. It showed Emily riding in the cycle lane before appearing to hit a bump in the road and being jolted into the path of the passing lorry.Her gold helmet, which she had been ­wearing, was found at the scene.Jake said: “The police were incredible. The ambulance crews were there in four minutes and I don’t blame the truck driver at all.“It was an awful accident and Emily knew the risks she was ­taking. I went to stay with her parents and her sisters, who were devastated but so supportive.“I told them I had bought the scooter for her.“They said I shouldn’t feel guilty and it wasn’t my fault.”One small comfort for Jake and her family is that so much of Emily’s le was documented on social media.He said: “I did get a few ­messages on Instagram from trolls telling me it was my fault, which is not nice but that’s what you get online. I have been blown away by the people who have been in touch telling me what an inspiration Emily was to them.“People were saying things like, ‘Your girlfriend saved my le’, because of the way she talked about issues such as depression and anxiety.“Emily’s message was to talk, talk, talk about things that may have a stigma. We are going to carry on her work.“She created a thing called Brain Buddies, a safe group space for people to talk about their problems.“We are getting it an Instagram page and going to take it on in her name.“She was such a kind, considerate, effortless person — it would be an honour to carry on her work.“We want to make sure she is remembered as someone who broke down the stigma around mental health, rather than the first person to die on a scooter on our roads.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Stena Bulk, which owns the ship, said it was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The firm said Iranian authorities had told them the crew were in “good health” and being held at Iranian port Bandar Abbas. A second oil tanker, the Mesdar, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards in what appeared to be a co-ordinated attack.The Mesdar’s Glasgow-based operator said communication had since been re-established with the ship and the crew were unharmed.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt accused Iran of a “hostile and aggressive” act.Following the Cobra meetings, the British Astute-class nuclear-powered submarine, believed to be at sea already, is expected to head to the region within days. It will listen to Iranian communications before passing information back to UK operational HQ at Northwood, in North West London.Military chiefs chose it because of the danger posed by Iranian Yono-class “midget submarines”. Retired naval Commander Tom Sharpe said: “The Yono midget submarine is a particular menace.“Often lurking just below the surface, they are armed with a couple of heavyweight torpedoes. These will kill a frigate and possibly even a carrier. There are always a couple at sea and they are hard to track and even harder to defeat.”The Royal Marines — some of whom are already in the region — will come from M Company,  Commando. They would be authorised to use heavy-calibre machine guns, snipers and light anti-tank missiles to deter Iranian forces.HMS Duncan, a Type  air-defence destroyer, was also heading towards the Gulf to assist the Navy’s only warship in the area, the Type  Duke class frigate HMS Montrose.Support ship RFA Cardigan Bay is based in Bahrain as well as four mine countermeasures ships. HMS Kent, another Type  anti-submarine frigate, is due to depart for the Gulf in five weeks.Navy support ship RFA Wave Knight is also on her way to the region and left Gibraltar last night. A military source said: “We have the ability to send more ships but they will take weeks so the Marines are a perfect fit in the short term.“The men have been told they could be deployed on to commercial vessels. Tankers are also now likely to travel in convoy and shipping will be protected. But our main brief is not to escalate the situation — and provide a deterrent.”The Government last night advised all UK ships to avoid the area. A spokesman said: “We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s unacceptable actions which represent a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation.”It’s extraordinary that there weren’t stricter controls on UK ship movements in the region.Ministry of Defence resources may be stretched but we should not have let tankers go into what is a dangerous zone without an escort.We have fallen into Iran’s trap: They wanted a vessel to use as leverage against us and they have won that battle.I now see Tehran escalating.

This is the toxic legacy of Theresa May.  Under pressure, the Tory leadership candidates have acknowledged that schools, hospitals, social care and the police don’t have enough money – asthe last nine years in government had nothing to do with them. So the first test for the next Prime Minister must be to do what Theresa May promised, but failed to deliver: end austerity. But on the campaign trail the candidates have been more interested in trying to prove their virility by threatening a No Deal exit from the EU. That is reckless. No Deal would trash our industries – from car manufacturing to farming. It would raise food prices and cause medicine shortages in the NHS.  The reality is they want a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump as the basis of for our future trade. But the US administration’s priority is well known to all: it’s America First. When Theresa May invited Trump to dine with the Queen, he named his price: the opening up of our NHS for takeover by American corporations. So the second test for whoever becomes the next Prime Minister is: do they have the confidence to put No Deal, or any damaging Tory deal, to a public vote  The third test is whether they’re prepared to take the necessary action to tackle the climate emergency.  I know what Labour will do: we will kick start a Green Industrial Revolution to deliver new jobs in green industries that will help us halt the slide into climate breakdown. At the current rate of progress, this government’s pledge to get to net zero carbon emissions won’t be met until  – more than fty years too late. We cannot wait that long. The science is clear and indisputable – we need to reduce our emissions now and fast. Air pollution is right now killing , people a year in the UK. At a time of climate crisis, investment in renewables is actually falling. The Tories scrapped the solar feed-in tarf, virtually banned onshore wind, and they failed to invest in the Swansea tidal lagoon. Instead they back fracking – you really couldn’t make it up.

The man, in his thirties, said of his colleagues, who died in the past four years: “They couldn’t cope any more. “Their deaths were hushed up, but the public needs to know what’s happening.”    He told how he suffered verbal abuse every day, and physical attacks monthly. “People have a go at us for taking three hours to get to them, which is not our fault.

Leaders of the private community say there is no debt, no crime and no homelessness, and everyone has a job but none of them earn a salary. Outsiders in modern day Britain may find it baffling that none of the children watch television or play video games, no-one logs on to Facebook or any other social media sites to see what their neighbours are up to, and residents donapost carry mobile phones. Members of the -strong Darvell Bruderhof community must ask permission to begin ‘courting’ a person of the opposite sex, orces are banned, their jobs are chosen for them and they have no possessions.    A new documentary has been given extraordinary access to the community, which has quietly existed in Britain for almost  years and allowed TV cameras for the first time. The programme follows a number of members, including a young woman who has left the settlement and is questioning her future in the sect which refuses to join mainstream society. Located ten miles north of Hastings since , the near self-sufficient communityis in a converted tuberculosis sanatorium near the village of Robertsbridge.  The Bruderhof Christian movement is based around common ownership and was founded in Germany in  by protestant theologian Eberhard Arnold. The community was forced to flee in  after refusing to join the Nazi Party, and many members moved to England. But they left for Paraguay and then North America when members were threatened with internment in , only to later . Living as disciples of Jesus, members give up all possessions, money and status when they take their vow of commitment.  Everything is provided for them - from groceries to clothing - and members run a farm, orchard, schools and a multi-million-pound business which makes children’s toys and furniture. Itaposs a simple way of le, based on early biblical text, which is similar to the lestyles of the Amish. There is a personal cost and sacrice for residents, with strict rules and restrictions around same-sex relationships, orce and what members wear. Women avoid fashions of any sort, wearing modest clothing including headscarves, long plaid dresses and loose shirts. The unorm looks like traditional peasant dress.  Many decisions about the residentsapos lives are made for them, including where they live and the jobs they do. Family live in shared houses with several other families, and most meals are taken with other residents in a large communal dining room. Members are frequently moved between the other  Bruderhof settlements in the world. There are just , members wordlwide, and the other communities in the UK are in Nonington, Kent, and Peckham, south London.  Bernard Hibbs, , the community’s outreach director, is featured in the programme with his we Rachel. He said: We have a dferent vision for our society. We don’t proselytise, it’s unwholesome to try to make people become members. But we thought, aposWhy not show people how we live apos When I go outside the community, people are interested in it.  They worry about their kids and technology, and like the idea of sharing.  So we’re showing what we’ve learnt. It’s not perfect, butwe can encourage people to think about how they live, that’s great. Bernard, whose parents joined the community when he was nine, added: This is about people living according to the New Testament. People loving each other, sharing possessions and supporting each other. He rejected any notion that the Bruderhof is a cult, adding: People who have never visited us sometimes imagine that we might be a cult. But when they come, they find we are far too normal to qualy - there are no UFOs, no weird rituals, no secret handshakes.

She fell out with her local party last year after voting with the Tories on Brexit. Activists have since been trying to oust her. Labour MPs became suspicious when Ms Hoey was spotted meeting Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice in the House of Commons days ago. One said: “That sparked our worries she will become the first Brexit Party MP. “Kate was facing deselection anyway and that may have finally tipped her over into defecting.”    Earlier this month, Ms Hoey announced that she was retiring from politics in a passionate letter. She said: I will carry on until a general election serving with the energy, honesty and integrity that I have tried to bring to public service my whole le.

Despite representing one of the most inner city seats she is a former chair of the Countryside Alliance and is in favour of fox hunting.  She attacked Labouraposs decision to ban handguns following the Dunblane massacre. She is also in favour of grammar schools which puts her at odds with lots of Labour Party members. She has a patchy voting record on gay rights and abortion. Despite spouting views which are at odds with the majority of her constituents, Ms Hoey held the seat in  with  per cent of the vote.

He said he was horried when his surgeon allegedly informed him that he believed breast implants - which could have ruptured at any point - had been used instead.   Unlike bum implants, which can withstand weights of up to lbs before rupturing, fake breasts are softer and cannot support as much weight.Mr Parke, from Dudley, in the West Midlands, slammed the clinic which conducted his first surgery, saying he could have died from sepsis had the implants ruptured.He said panic set in when a huge hole appeared in his right cheek, which quickly filled with puss and flesh.    Mr Parke said: I canapost believe they discovered I had breast implants in my bum. I had no idea. No one in the UK was able to help as Iaposd had my surgery abroad and it needed to be corrected as soon as possible. It has been a total disaster from start to finish.

The Iran Students News Agency , which is partially funded by the countryaposs Government, released images today as tensions in the region escalate. Defence secretary Penny Mordaunt told Sky News the tanker was intercepted in Omani waters, describing the incident as a hostile act - and denied reports a British warship was  minutes from the tankeraposs position - saying it was an hour away from being able to help. This afternoon, Britain summoned the Iranian Charge daposAffaires in London for talks over the seizure.    The pictures and footage purportedly show the Stena Impero in the port of  the city of Bander Abbas, the capital of the southern coastal region of Hormozgan, even as the UK Government vows retaliation over the seizure. The Iranian reports say the vessel was not carrying any cargo and its detained crew may be subjected to technical interviews.  IranapossCouncil, a powerful constitutional watchdog, says the seizure of the tanker was in response to Britainaposs role in seizing an Iranian tanker earlier this month. The Stena Impero had been sailing through the Strait of Hormuz to Saudi Arabia when it was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday.  The British warship the HMS Montrose sped to help the UK-flagged oil tanker as it was being seized by Iran, but the frigate was ten minutes too late, it was reported. A defence source told The Times frigate was dispatched while the Stena Impero was in Omani waters, however it arrived after the tanker had entered Iranian territorial waters. The source told The Times Iran appeared to be taking a very aggressive stance and was viewed as having been ready to engage HMS Montrose  she had arrived in time. However Mordaunt told Sky HMS Montrose was an hour away from the tankeraposs position, not  minutes. The incident has led Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to vow a robust but diplomatic response. He offered to help release  Grace , which was seized in Gibraltar on July  on suspicion of smuggling oil to Syria in breach of EU regulations.    If Iran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assadaposs regime. He tweeted this morning: Yesterdayaposs action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar’s LEGAL detention of oil bound for Syria. As I said yesterday our reaction will be considered but robust. We have been trying to find a way to resolve Grace issue but WILL ensure the safety of our shipping. The US Secetary of Defence Richard Spencer also announced he would send hundreds of troops, aircraft and missiles to Sauda Arabia in order to counter any potential aggression from Iran.    The affair has led the former head of the Royal Navy Lord West to blast for the British forces for having too few ships as he labelled it extraordinary that the Stena was travelling through the tense region without an escort. Iranaposs semi-official Fars news agency claimed on Saturday that the detained tanker was in an accident with an Iranian fishing boat and ignored its distress call.    Today Fars quotedCouncil spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei as saying that the rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law. The council is viewed as representing the views of Iranaposs supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Phillip Herron, , was trying to feed and clothe his family while out of work, falling behind with rent and trying to repay £, debts — including payday loans of over , per cent interest. He applied for government help but the month-long wait for Universal Credit drove him deeper into debt. “That was the final nail in his coffin,” said his grieving mum Sheena Derbyshire, . Phillip’s final act as he sat in his car on a quiet country lane on March  was to upload a picture of himself crying to social media. Minutes later he was dead. Have you got a story about struggling with Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror    “In his suicide note he said his family would be better offhe wasn’t there any more,” Sheena added. “He was a single dad. He was responsible. He always had money before and the kids had the best of everything. “But Phillip had quit his job as a factory worker recently to look after his young kids and he got in to debt, which must have been dficult for him. “To suddenly have no money for them must have been very hard. He was waiting for Universal Credit and had just £. when he died. “When people turn to the Government for help they’re already desperate. To make them wait so long for payments is dangerous. “There’s no reason it should take so long. Phillip already had problems but I think this was the final straw.” Universal Credit – brought in by the Coalition Government  and rolled out nationwide since – was meant to replace a series of benefits with just one. But it is paid monthly in arrears, meaning an average wait of five weeks for the first payment. Labour claims the delay drives families into debt, poverty and eviction and aims to reform it.    Like many people, Phillip Herron was deeply in debt when, without telling his family, he applied for Universal Credit. “His death came as a complete shock,” Sheena said. “I couldn’t understand why he’d do this.” It was only later that Sheena pieced together what had happened. Papers in his home showed he owed around £, to banks, utility firms and payday lenders with, Sheena said, “, per cent interest rates”. She also found an eviction notice sent to him by the Bernicia Homes housing association. And she discovered from his children that things got so bad at Christmas “Santa had not come”. But worse was to come when, after weeks of trying, she worked out the code to unlock his phone. Mum-of-six Sheena trawled through emails and listened to months of calls he had recorded. “I was trying to knit his le together,” she said. “You could hear him changing so much over those final months. “He used to be very quietly spoken but in his recent calls and messages he was often screaming. “He loved his kids but he started shouting at them. And you can hear him sobbing in calls. I heard him talking about suicide to other people. “I wish he’d told us how he was feeling but we never knew. “Listening to those last few months of calls I started asking myself, ‘Who is this person ’ He’d changed so much so very quickly. “If we didn’t have his phone and his computer we wouldn’t have known what had been going on for him. It was like walking back­wards through his le. It’s the most heart-wrenching thing I’ve ever done.” Sheena has been haunted by guilt since Phillip’s death. “I’ll never be OK,” she said. “There’s not a second in the day I don’t miss him. “Every morning I wake up and wish I didn’t have to face another day without him, but I keep going for the kids. “His youngest daughter is totally lost. She misses her dad so much. “She had a dream the other night that he came to her. She said, ‘I asked him not to leave again. But when I woke up he wasn’t there’. “They haven’t even been offered counselling,” Sheena added.    The system failed Phillip – now it’s failing his ex-partner and their ­children too.” Sheena hopes the evidence she found will be used at a full inquest into Phillip’s death, at Sacriston, Co Durham, and expose the failings of Universal Credit. She believes talking about his suicide and its impact on his family can help others too. Sheena said: “You don’t just go out one day and take your own le. There’s a build-up. “So please, please talk to someone. Don’t let another family go through this. If you can’t talk to family or friends, there are people like Samaritans.” Last night a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with Mr Herron’s family. “Suicide is a very complex issue, so it would be wrong to link it solely to someone’s benefit claim. “We are committed to safeguarding vulnerable claimants and keep guidance under constant review to provide the highest standard of protection.” A Bernicia spokesperson said when tenants face dficulties “our approach is to seek to work with them to help overcome these. “A small number of cases could ultimately end in residents losing their home but this is a long process and we see this as a last resort. “Help and support is available at every stage. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr Herron’s family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"starbucks costa mcdonalds selling iced","story":"NewsStarbucks, Costa and McDonalds selling iced coffees with two days worth of sugarCampaigners want the sugar tax to cover coffee shops too - but brands say their sugary creations are just an occasional treat.ShareCommentsByStephen HaywardDominik Lemanski:,  JUL NewsStarbucks Strawberry Donut Frappuccino is the worst offender on the high street with a whopping .g of sugar\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHigh street coffee chains are serving iced drinks laced with up to  teaspoons of sugar.

Maisie-Rae Adams says she was shocked by what the teacher said, grabbed a sanitary towel and fled the classroom. The -year-old had had an accident and needed to change her sanitary towel when the teacher refused to allow her to leave, reports Gloucestershire Live. She had already asked to use the bathroom twice but had been refused. It was when year nine student Maisie-Rae asked a third time and said to the teacher that she was on her period that the teacher replied she aposneeded to learn to control her periodapos.  After leaving anyway to change her pad Maisie-Rae ed to the classroom where the teacher told her that her bag was aposin another roomapos, Maisie-Rae claims. The headteacher at Rednock School in Dursley said the situation was aposnot as has been interpretedapos. Mother-of-four Kelly Adams, , said: “When Maisie told me about it I felt so angry that I could cry. She is a mini me. With her confidence and even her shyness we are the same. I know how she feels. Maisie felt humiliated and embarrassed and it is horrible what happened to her. Maisie also says she had been given three previous detentions for needing to be excused to go to the toilet. On each of these occasions it was due to her period. Kelly said: We had a meeting at the school at am on Thursday. It was explained to me that Maisie had apparently raised her voice and walked out of the room. Maisie had not wanted to be late to the lesson so she waited until she got there and asked. She should never of had a detention for needing to go to the toilet during her period. Maisie and her mother both suffer from having heavy periods that sometimes occur up to three times in one month. Maisie said: The class seemed to be in shock at what happened as well. I just grabbed mypad and went to the toilet. When I tried to come back in to the classroom the teacher told me that my bag was in another room and I could not go back to class. Me and mum have had a talk and we want to be able to let the teachers know discreetly that girls are on their periods. They are both working on proposals to get pupils talking about them, so there is no stigma surrounding the natural transition for girls into womanhood. Kelly said: The school have said to us in the meeting that they have a pink card policy that the girls can show the teacher. Maisie was not aware of this though.  I think it would be a good idea to get the girls wearing a little pink wristband and then it would show the teachers and others that the girl is on her period and that they may be a little emotional and not able to concentrate that week. I have spoken to the headteacher at the school who is very interested at the proposal. I want to be able to go into the school and talk about what happens to the girls and we need to make sure that the girls are not ashamed of what is happening to their bodies. The school have carried out an investigation and have stated that they can not comment on inidual cases. Headteacher David Alexander said: I cannot talk about inidual students or events which can identy inidual students, however I can talk about what we do. We do allow students to go to the toilet for issues relating to their periods. In fact we have apostime outapos cards specically for that purpose - we introduced this to all girls in assemblies at the start of the year. Every girl had the opportunity to carry one. The system does work effectively and is discreet. We are sensitive to the needs of all students but especially girls in this situation, who are developing emotionally and physically.

He said: August is looking like the best month of summer and is likely to deliver maximum temperatures in the mid-Cs at the very least.    This is not going to be restricted to southern parts of the country, even Scotland and the far north of England could see temperatures hitting these extreme values at times during the end of July and through August. However, severe humidity could become a real issue and despite a potentially countrywide barbecue August, we can also expect a triggering of widespread and vigorous thunderstorm activity within this period.The Met Office has also predicted high temperatures in the first half of August, and hasnapost ruled out the possibility that the heatwave could last longer than a few weeks. Met Office meteorologist Bonnie Diamond said: Temperatures will rise quite widely on Sunday with plenty of sunshine, and this sets us up for the start of the week. We have high pressure building from the continent, bringing warm air to the south of the UK. Across the north it will be unsettled as there is an area of low pressure to the north bringing some quite strong winds. During the start of the week, temperatures will rise as warm air comes up from the continent. There will also be home-grown warmth due to high pressure over Britain. There is a chance we could see Cin parts of the country by Tuesday.

Her mum had not experienced any complications during her pregnancy, medics said.    She was later referred to the District Hospital in Etah as the primary health centre lacked proper medical facilities.

Maru, a one-year-old Bullmastf, had been put on the Trans-Siberian train to take her back to the kennels where she was born after her owner said she was allergic to her and no longer wanted to keep her.But she managed to escape from the train, which was heading west from Krasnoyarsk to Novosibirsk, when she used her paws to open a compartment door and fled as it stopped at a remote station near Achinsk. Train staff desperately shouted after the loyal Maru from the , but to no avail.    In Novosibirsk, kennel owner Alla Morozova organised a search party to find the lost dog and pleaded for information on social media. And amazingly, two-and-a-half days later the exhausted and wounded Maru was discovered at an industrial estate, close to the home of the owner who rejected her after just six months. The dog appeared to be in tears when she was found. She had carefully gone east next to the Trans-Siberian railway track - the longest in the world - and made it through  miles of wild countryside.Alla told The Siberian Times : Luckily neither bears ate her, nor wolves chewed her up.The dog was very tired. She was lame, her paws were broken. The pads on her feet were damaged. Her muzzle was broken.    The exhausted pet fell down a railway embankment in Krasnoyarsk before being found and recognised. Train staff told Alla that Maru had suffered a panic attack and was frightened of the noise of the train and being away from her home and her owners. When the train stopped she jumped on the compartment door, kicked the handle to open it and almost threw the conductor out of the way. She jumped out like a bullet. When the door opened to the , she jumped out into the night, into the taiga [swampy Siberian forest].

on the night and - on aggregate.Dons boss McInnes hailed the composure and calmness of his teenage midfielders Campbell, , and Lewis Ferguson, . And Aberdonian Campbell was thrilled to mark his first start in Europe with a win.He said: “It is a dream come true to play in a European competition and to play my part in a win in my first start which takes us through to the next round is fantastic.“I really appreciate the gaffer’s trust in me by putting me into a game like that.“It’s down to me after that to prove why he shows the faith in me and as long as he keeps doing that I have to keep working hard and do as best as I can when I get the opportunity.”Campbell was given the chance to play due to Craig Bryson missing the first round with an ankle injury.With Bryson due to resume training on Sunday and new signing Funso Ojo also joining the squad for next week’s second qualying round tie at Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia, Campbell faces a fight to keep his place in the side. But he will use team-mate Ferguson’s success in holding down a regular place in the team as inspiration.]He said: “I’m comfortable in this team and feel I can cope with first-team games and European games. I just have to keep working as hard as I can and the manager will keep his faith in me.“Fergie had a terric season last year and will only kick on. He’s a fantastic young player and I enjoy playing alongside him so hopefully this is a partnership which we can develop.”Campbell, a product of the club’s youth system, has grown up watching the first team try to reach the group stages of the competition. This campaign, the sixth in a row under manager Derek McInnes, represents as good an opportunity as any.The importance for the club and the team in making it to the group stages has not been lost on the teenager.Huge clubs such as Premier League Arsenal and Manchester United as well as Italian side Roma lie in wait.The Aberdonian, a lelong Dons fan, is living his dream in being involved in European competition with his home city side.He said: “It’s always been an ambition, even as a little kid, to play in a European competition.“To get my first start is brilliant.I’ve watched the Real Sociedad games, the Groningen games as a fan so to be part of it is great.“All Aberdeen fans know of the glory days against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but times have changed due to the money in the game now.“We’ve just got to do all we can to get to the group stages and that starts with the next round in Georgia.“It would be absolutely brilliant to get there.“That’s our aim every time we go into this competition and to get through would be fantastic for the players and financially for the club. It’s huge. I want to test myself against the best competition that is out there.“European competition is the cream at the top of the game.”The last time Aberdeen played in the group stages was during Jimmy Calderwood’s reign. The Dons reached the last  of the Uefa Cup in  before being eliminated - on aggregate by German giants Bayern Munich.Campbell was still at primary school during that run but the memories remain vivid today.He said: “I was a season ticket in the South Stand. I used to sit next to the away fans and I loved it. I was at the Bayern game in  and I remember that one and the Copenhagen game.“I would have been seven years old watching games like that so it’s great to be here  years later.“Hopefully I can kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43958740-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43958740-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43958740-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.43958740-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes started homework early","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes began preparation for the Europa League clash with FC Chikhura Sachkere on the flight back to Scotland after defeating RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.McInnes studied scouting reports of the Georgians’ two games against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the previous round on the flight which touched down early yesterday morning.He will also study extensive footage of Sachkere who the Dons face at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, Tbilisi, on Thursday .McInnes said: “We had match reports to read on the Georgians on the plane on the way home and will start to get a grip on them over the next few days.“We had our scouts out for both their games against Fola Esch.

This is going to let us trace the stories of the people linked to the first reference of the still.“The royal references are really limited but these will allow us to build up the story with the surrounding context. It’s going to let us put names and inidual people to the story of this still.”The record also includes suggestions about where the still may have been located – with the spot believed to be on a street already associated with whisky.Dr Armstrong added: “Andrew Gray had property in a street known as Guestrow.“Today just a small section of Guestrow remains and it is home to the appropriately named ‘Illicit Still’ pub.“The name recalls a later age when whisky was crafted for sale undetected by the taxman, but it is possible that its location has a connection to the history of Scotch going back much further.“This is a very signicant find in the history of our national drink. It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

It is not clear when the older photograph was taken, but it must have been in the early part of the th century, perhaps nudging into the late th century.The cottages are mostly thatched, while poles on the shore may be stances for drying fishing nets.Why there is a ladder up the tree to the right of the photograph is anyone#s guess.The field in the foreground behind the cottages is likely to have been croft land, but is now built upon with newer homes. It is virtually impossible to recreate the same scene between buildings and tall garden vegetation. Though not taken from the same spot, the image above gives an idea of the more cluttered scene in the st century."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club senior championship","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Jimmy Kerr, who won Sunday#s Seniors Championship with a score of .

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

The first three weeks of sailing lessons have finished successfully with many of the participants enjoying themselves so much that they signed back on for a second week.The fourth week looks to be particularly busy with demand for the under-s course so high that organisers have had to change the afternoon from adult lesson to under-s. There are still spaces available in weeks five and six for both under-s in the morning lessons and adults in the afternoon lessons.Last weekend also saw the club hosting Cushendall Sailing Club for theleg of their annual race.The club’s relationship with Cushendall goes back more than  years with both clubs visiting each other every year and holding a yacht race with the inidual winner over both legs winning the North Channel Shield and a prize for the winning team.This year there was no race when Campbeltown visited Cushendall as there was not enough wind and so all was to play for when the race began last Saturday afternoon.This year#s inidual winner was James Farrell, skipper of Sigmania, a Sigma  from Cushendall. A worthy winner, James is a highly experienced sailor and has coached the Northern Ireland dinghy sailors at international level. The team prize also went to Cushendall.The event is not all about the yacht race, as the social side is also very enjoyable and friendships have been made and sustained over the years. The relationship between the two clubs is very strong and there is a feeling in both camps that this event is a highlight of the sailing year and should be continued for years to come.For more information of the sailing lessons, visit Campbeltown Sailing Club#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"dairy farmers are positive about campbeltown creamerys future","story":"Farmers who supply milk to Campbeltown Creamery are #positive# that its award-winning range of dairy products have a future.This comes the week after First Milk, the farmer-owned co-operative which owns the creamery, announced that it plans to scale-down operations in Campbeltown.First Milk, which put its creameries in Campbeltown and Arran up for sale in April  because they #were not core to its business strategy for the future#, last Wednesday announced the start of employee consultation in connection with proposed changes at both sites.There are  farms across Kintyre and Gigha which supply milk to Campbeltown Creamery.Discussions with local farmer members, with the active involvement of the Scottish Government, remain ongoing.It is hoped the creamery will ultimately be owned by the local farmers, who, it is envisaged, will form a new co-operative to operate the creamery independently of First Milk.Due to the ongoing economic performance of the Campbeltown site, and in anticipation that the scale of the operation is likely to change under this new ownership, First Milk began consultation with staff at Campbeltown about proposals to scale-down the operation.A First Milk spokesman said this week that there are #potentially roles at risk# as a result of the restructuring at the creamery, which has  employees.James Barbour of Machribeg Farm, who is chairman of the Kintyre milk producers working group, said: #First Milk has worked hard to secure a sustainable future for the Campbeltown Creamery over the last  months.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9609431.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Even when the skies are dark and the weather isnrsquot great, you can still get amazing pictures.The wildflowers of the machair, the white sandy bays and the birds of prey, among them the short-eared owl which can be seen during daytime gliding across the moorland, offer the best picture opportunities, she adds.At Lochboisdale Hotel in South Uist, owner Calum MacAulay is braced for the flood of Instagram stars tempted to capture the islands for their followers.If they could pop over at the end of summer and stay for winter, hersquod be even happier.ldquoIt would be fantastic for us to have visitors from October onwards, he says.ldquoWe have had photographers visit outside of summer. They have told us the light here at that time of year canrsquot be beaten.One thing hersquos less keen on, however, are Instagram ldquoinfluencers looking for a free stay infor a hashtag mention to their followers. ldquoI donrsquot think so, he says.While the maps are intended to help photographers find their ideal image, in other areas there have been concerns that picture-hungry tourists could be putting the landscape at risk.Stacked pyramids of stones have appeared on a number of Unesco-listed beaches on Orkney, at the Fairy Glen on the Isle of Skye and on Iona. While enthusiasts say the stones are artistic, nature groups have warned against the practice.Others have been criticised for laying out food in an attempt to lure deer, red squirrels and birds of prey for pictures, while some Instagrammers ndash such as American so-called lsquoprofessional huntressrsquo visitor Larysa Switlyk created outrage after sharing images of a ram, goat and stag killed on a trip to Islay.Freelance landscape and travel photographer Ali Horne warns that a balance is required between encouraging visitors and retaining the uniqueness of beauty spots.ldquoTherersquos a tricky balance between promoting places which donrsquot have enough visitors and having too many, he says.ldquoI now avoid Skye in the summertime because the number of people means itrsquos too populated, and Irsquom becoming more conscious of what I am posting on social media, he adds.Andrew Macnair, of CalMac Ferries, says the maps are in response to rising demand. ldquoWhen we developed the idea of the maps, it was with the intention of using them online to help visitors to the island discover all the hidden gems Uist has to offer.ldquoHowever, the enthusiasm that has flooded into the tourism office for the products showed there was a demand to create a physical product.The maps cost pound and proceeds go to help the Royal National Leboat Institution .Robert McKinnon, Chief Executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, adds: ldquoSocial media has put the islands on the map, with so many Insta-friendly locations on our doorstep.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming visitors to Uist and seeing Instagram feeds fill with snapshots of their adventures on the islands."},{"url":null,"title":"cleaner-campervan-helps-highland-tourists-go-extra-mile","story":"Summer has brought an invasion of campervans and motorhomes to Scotlandrsquos usually open roads, occupying lay-bys, chugging along the NC, taking the Skye Bridge to the Fairy Pools and sprawling across at least two parking berths outside the local Co-op to stock up on supplies of Chardonnay and hand-cooked crisps.Find yourself staring at the back end of one ndash typically loaded with mountain bikes ndash while negotiating one of the countryrsquos narrow roads and you could be in for a long, frustrating journey.Campervan and motorhome sales and hires in Scotland are said to have rocketed in recent years as adventurous tourists seek to explore hard-to-reach areas and take control of where they visit, when and for how long they stay.Such is the demand for them that some campervan dealers are reporting seven-month waiting lists for certain bespoke vehicles.According to the most recent figures from the National Caravan Council,  saw a  per cent rise in the number of motorhomes registered in the UK, with an estimated , on the road at the time.Itrsquos a figure thatrsquos thought to have leapt even higher since then, fuelled by slick marketing for north coast road trip holidays and a new breed of tourist anxious to lower their carbon footprint by avoiding flying in favour of embracing nature on their own doorstep.However, concern is mounting that the trend for hitting the road means some may be inadvertently adding to the environmental crisis and even creating their own green calamity.Earlier this month, alarm over a ldquocampervan epidemic prompted one local councillor on the NC route to announce plans to log registration numbers of campers who flout prohibition notices by setting up camp at Dornoch beach.East Sutherland and Edderton councillor Jim McGillivray claimed the vans were taking up limited parking spaces in the area and causing hygiene problems, with ldquowild toileting a particular concern.Others have raised worries that self-sufficient campervans and motorhomes bring little financial benefits to the communities they visit.Meanwhile, soaring numbers heading to the Western Isles have previously prompted MSP Alasdair Allan to raise the suggestion of a ldquomotorhome levy on the vehicles, citing concerns over the space needed for locals on ferries as well as the impact on areas of natural beauty by drivers parking overnight on the machair, leaving litter, toilet waste and tyre tracks.Add to the mix the diesel emissions pumped out by motorhomes and campervans and the ldquohappy camper image of someone in touch with nature seems just a little at odds with reality.ldquoCampervans are a growing market, agrees Gary Hayes of Grangemouth-based Eco-Campers, which creates a new breed of hybrid campervans designed to be less environmentally toxic than their diesel-fuelled cousins.ldquoThere are lots of people lsquostaycationingrsquo, and lots of people want to explore their backyard.ldquoThere has been a phenomenal rise in campervan sales since  and the industry has also seen big changes. But we havenrsquot built a diesel campervan in two years.While an all-electric campervan would certainly tick a few ldquogreen boxes, issues such as finding a recharging spot in the middle of nowhere make their practicality tough for even the toughest of camper.Instead, Mr Hayes claims to have pioneered the next best thing ndash the worldrsquos first fully hybrid and ldquotribrid four-wheel-drive fully independent campervans, powered by low-emission petrol engines and a hybrid battery that also powers white appliances.The design removes the need for gas fuel and a V hook-up for power. The result, he says, is a ldquogame-changer. in the modern campervan market ndash and perhaps some peace of mind for the environmentally-conscious camper.ldquoElectric vehicle range isnrsquot there, he says. ldquoThe point with a campervan is you want to get to places where yoursquore quite far away from home. Yoursquore not going to park up and find somewhere to charge your vehicle.ldquoThe hybrid petrol and electric system is designed to use electric around town and, when yoursquore out on the road, you use petrol.ldquoItrsquos self-charging ndash so when yoursquore driving on the petrol engine, every time you slow down or brake, you recharge the battery.His design for an LPG -fuelled van is even greener, emitting fewer toxic gases than petrol or diesel ndash and itrsquos cheaper.Eco-Campers, which has received backing from Scottish Enterprise, has positioned itself as an innovator in hybrid technologies and has worked hand-in-hand with researchers at leading universities to develop new energy sources and improved hybrid batteries for its vans.Such is demand that the business anticipates seeing its turnover rise by % over the next five years, while there are plans to expand the technology to markets in Canada, Australia and America.However, a boost in green credentials is unlikely to be much comfort to islanders and rural communities struggling to cope with the influx of large vehicles on narrow roads.For Western Isles residents and businesses hoping to squeeze on to ferries, campervans and motorhomes have added to the pressure: while just  took the Ullapool-to-Stornaway ferry in -, an estimated , used it  years later.Over the same period, the figure for Uig to Tarbert in Harris jumped from  to ,, while Oban to Castlebrae rose from  to .The roll-out of the Road Equivalent Tarfin the Western Isles, which has reduced fares, is thought to have encouraged many on to roads.Meanwhile just getting anywhere with your campervan is becoming a challenge in itself: the pick of campsites on key routes regularly display lsquono vacanciesrsquo signs, while earlier this year campervan tickets for the th Tiree Music Festival sold out within  minutes of going on sale.ldquoIn terms of scenery, the Western Isles plays host to some of the most spectacular landscapes and habitats in the world, and it is not surprising that RET has led to a large increase in the number of campervans travelling to the islands to experience this, says Alasdair Allan, MSP.ldquoTourism has taken on an increasing importance to the economy of the islands in recent years, says MSP Alasdair Allan. ldquoFor it to be sustainable, it is vitally important we have the right infrastructure in place and that the effects of tourism are not felt to be in conflict with island communities.ldquoThat means making sure there are sufficient waste disposal units, enough parking berths and available advice for driving on island roads.ldquoIt also means finding ways to ensure islanders donrsquot suffer as a result of the large demand for deck spaces on ferries.ldquoTo this end, I very much welcome the recent moves by the Scottish Government in looking to pilot a scheme that would keep some car space held back for islanders who need to travel at short notice."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-vows-remain-loyal-successor-prime-minister","story":"The PM said she would do ldquoeverything I can to ensure there is a Conservative government, and confirmed that she had voted in the final round of the Tory leadership contest.Frontrunner Mr Johnson is widely predicted to beat Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt to be announced as the next party leader on Tuesday, and Mrs May will stand down the following day.Here is tomorrows @Daily_Express #frontpage:ndash British oil tankers seized by #Iran as tensions risendash EXCLUSIVE: @theresa_may gives her final Number  interview ndash says #Tories must unite to deliver #Brexit #TomorrowsPapersToday pic APKHjkRAmdash July , In an interview with the , Mrs May was asked whether she would remain loyal to her successor.She replied: ldquoAbsolutely.

This one surveyed the UKrsquos happiest places to live and work. Presumably, respondents all had a job and a roof over their heads.Even in the most jocund fun factories there always lurks a wandering Jeremiah. Earlier this month, Gary Smith, secretary of the GMB Union in Scotland, expressed a rather less ecstatic tone. In an interview in The Herald on Sunday he said: ldquoIt feels like a city that is in decline. Wersquove got public buildings in a state of decay ndash the Mitchell Library, the problems with the Peoplersquos Palace ndash the streets are absolutely filthy and wersquove got an epidemic of rats in large parts of the city. Too often the politicians are happy to hide behind this bluff and bluster about lsquopeople make Glasgowrsquo. The people of Glasgow deserve better than they are getting.Mr Smith cited public spending cuts and stealth privatisation as factors in many of Glasgowrsquos challenges. ldquoAll of this leaves the city in a state that feels unkempt, unloved and, in a lot of areas, actually really filthy. It is a city that is in economic and political decline.Those of us who have spent most of our lives living and working in Glasgow know which version of Glasgow is the authentic one. Lestyle surveys never extend to the sprawling neighbourhoods that lie to the north and east of the city. In these places multi-deprivation and health inequality remain among the worst in Europe, as they have been for more than a century. Many of Mr Smithrsquos union members live in these places. Until now the social challenges faced by these communities could be camouflaged in the breathless optimism of economic brochures selling an inward investment Xanadu to their fabled blue-chip companies.If they are proclaiming more than , businessesare located in the Glasgow city region and that they support more than , jobsthen they inadvertently paint a bleak picture. Why do so many Glaswegian families remain locked out of this economic Klondyke  No matter how spectacular a cityrsquos economic growth might be no matter how optimistic its long-term projections, these are shallow and meaninglesstens of thousands of people in the same old communities are unable to share in the bounty. Real growth and not this sham facsimile of it would trickle down into these places instead of accumulating in the bank accounts of the same few.Affluence and success can make you blind to the fact that Glaswegian men can lose  years of their le expectancy on a seven-mile stretch of the M from east to west. But when backdoor privatisation results in truncated essential services and a non-union workforce, the signs of decline begin to encroach on the city centre and the leafier neighbourhoods. Ultimately, tenants will pay more for additional services like bin collections. Rather than investing in these services they outsource to private firms, the least of whose concerns is the welfare of their workers and the cost to tenants. This is always how privatisation works.Meanwhile, the meter on Glasgowrsquos equal pay scandal is still running.

This must surely be fake news. How can this be so when Glasgow, its biggest city, is so happy and cheery and friendly all the time  As surely as a broken tumbler follows a dirty look, the supporters of the Scottish Government blamed the Tories for not giving them the powers to address this. The worst rates of drug addiction are in Scotlandrsquos poorest neighbourhoods and form part of the pattern of deprivation and disadvantage in these places. We have devolved power in this area. You canrsquot begin to deal with drugs until you first address the chronic health inequalities in these communities.Scotlandrsquos future economic prosperity rests on the performance of its biggest and most important city.

Parliament  be updated Monmdash Jeremy HuntJuly , ldquoNothing could be further from the truth, he said.ldquoGrace  was detained legally in Gibraltarian waters because it was carrying oil, against EU sanctions, to Syria, and thatrsquos why the Gibraltarian authorities acted totally with respect to due process and totally within the law.ldquoStena Impero was seized in Omani waters in clear contravention of international law, it was then forced to sail into Iran.ldquoThis is totally and utterly unacceptable. It raises very serious questions about the security of British shipping, and indeed international shipping, in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what ldquofurther measures the Government will take, on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three.ldquoOur priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.ldquoThatrsquos why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, thatrsquos why due process in Gibraltar continues.ldquoWe need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge drsquoaffaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britainrsquos role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for IranrsquosCouncil was quoted as saying ldquothe rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an ldquoillegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was ldquoviolating international maritime rules and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.Iranian TV showed balaclava-clad commandos boarding the tanker from a helicopter.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt described the incident as a ldquohostile act and told Sky News the frigate was  minutes away from being able to help.Stena Bulk, which owns the Stena Impero, said the ship was in ldquofull compliance with all navigation and international regulations when it was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.The Mesdarrsquos Glasgow-based operator said communication had since been re-established with the ship and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.Downing Street said Prime Minister Theresa May was in her constituency but was being kept informed of developments.Former chief of defence staff Lord Richards said Britain was ldquopretty limited in what military action it could take without the support of allies such as America, should economic sanctions fail to resolve the situation.But Mr Hunt said he had spoken to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the situation, and President Donald Trump said the US would be ldquoworking with the UK.The Foreign Secretary said the US had a ldquodferent approach to dealing with Iran, and that the UK would continue to support the Iran nuclear deal.ldquoThis is about the safety and security of British and international shipping in one of the most important seaways in the world, and that is why wersquore calling on Iran to reverse this illegal act, he said.ldquoWersquore looking for ways to de-escalate the situation but wersquore also very clear that we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security of British and international shipping.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iranrsquos actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK.Fears had been growing that the Iranian authorities were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the seizure of the Grace  tanker off the coast of Gibraltar on July  in an operation involving Royal Marines.The Grace  was suspected of violating EU sanctions by carrying a cargo of Iranian oil destined for Syria in breach of sanctions and Mr Hunt later offered to help release the vesselIran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assadrsquos regime.But Iranrsquos supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the tankerrsquos seizure an act of ldquopiracy on Tuesday and warned the UK to expect a response.A statement from Stena Bulk said ship manager Northern Marine Management had lost contact with the crew of  after ldquounidentied small crafts and a helicopter approached the vessel at about pm on

protect victims of workplace abuse from being silenced by bosses after a number of high-profile cases.Last year, Sir Philip Green was accused of using non-disclosure agreementsto stop several former employees from speaking out about bullying and sexual harassment at his Arcadia retail group.Many businesses use NDAs to protect commercially-sensitive information but company bosses have come under scrutiny for their alleged use of the clauses in response to abuse allegations following the ldquome too movement.Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst has said that the government is now launching new laws to protect workers from their employerrsquos NDAs to hide potential abuse and discrimination.She said the Government will not tolerate the use of the confidentiality clauses to ldquosilence and intimidate victims to stop them speaking out.The new legislation is intended to, for the first time, ban NDAs from being used to stop people disclosing information to the police, doctors or lawyers.Currently, NDAs cannot prevent people from whistleblowing in the public interest.The crackdown will ensure that employers make clear the limitations of the confidentiality clause in plain English, the business minister said.It will also provide more advice to iniduals over the clauses and introduce new enforcement measures to deal with agreements which fail to meet the legal requirements.Ms Tolhurst said: ldquoThe vast majority of businesses comply with the law and use NDAs legitimately ndash from protecting commercially-sensitive information to preventing information

law.Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality  Human Rights Commission, said: ldquoHarassment and discrimination should never go unanswered and unchallenged just because victims are

Commenting, Mr McDonald said: “I have written to Andrew Jarvis, Managing Director at Stagecoach Bluebird to advise him of the challenges my constituents face with the review of this service. It is essential that public transport is available for patients to get to the health centre in Dyce, and this service must be reinstated as soon as possible.“I urge Stagecoach to review this decision in order that a transport link is in place for those needing access to local healthcare”.The residents of Newmachar also have local councillor Martin Ford on their side.Cllr Ford first wrote to Stagecoach Bluebird in October asking the company to reconsider its decision to cease running buses via Dyce Asda.The bus stop at Asda is very close to Dyce Health Centre in Altonrae Gardens so many Newmachar residents used the buses via Asda to visit their doctor and dentist.The change in bus routing in Dyce was discussed at the October meeting of New Machar Community Council, and again at last week’s meeting.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports. We would encourage Prospect to revisit the offer and bring this dispute to an end.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands. It’s also evidence of the benefits of pooling and sharing across the UK.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart. Women more often take a break from full-time work to raise a family, with a long-term knock on effect on their pension savings. More affordable and accessible childcare would help the four in  women who have said they would like to work more hourschildcare was more accessible.One bright idea is to encourage childcare businesses to open in town centres – a move which would help both Messrs Hunt and Johnson achieve their stated aim of “saving the High Street”.While I don’t believe for one second that either candidate will spend the coming days discussing the vagaries of auto-enrolment pensions, they will do well to remember that people really do need a guiding hand when it comes to securing their future.Gregg McClymont is head of policy at The People’s Pension and former shadow pensions minister.

Having spent years working in Rio de Janeiro, Doyle was not only fluent in Portuguese but also understood the culture. “I got a call out of the blue and went from a job as a director in an advertising agency in Liverpool to translating for Sir Alex Ferguson in a nanosecond,” she said.Her current charges include Marcos Rojo and Tahith Chong at Manchester United, and Yan Valery at Southampton.“There’s the myth of the spoiled footballer earning lots of money. But many are humble, from simple backgrounds, young, shy and well brought up who just lead extraordinary lives.“Clubs instil respect for other people in them. Yes, some can be demanding but they lead demanding lives.“I mostly manage the foreign talent and they often need a lot of help with the language and culture. Something like paying a gas bill can be an impossible task when you don’t speak the language.” Doyle said one of the most unusual tasks she had to undertake was getting scrubbed up to go into an operating theatre after both Da Silva twins needed shoulder operations.“It was a coincidence it happened to them both, but it was a year apart. The surgeons needed me there so they could ask them questions.”During her time in Brazil, Doyle also developed a passion for singing along to the country’s highly popular and exuberant vintage bossa nova, samba and jazz-style music.As a contrast to the demands of her job, Doyle decided to try her hand at performing, taking annual leave and starting off with comedy gigs and singing.From there she progressed to cabaret and now sings along to bossa nova numbers with her band made up of drummer Vidar Norheim, formerly of Wave Machines, Micky Dunne, gypsy-jazz guitarist, and Jesse Eigan, jazz bassist.“It’s very dferent from dealing with the players, but I would say I was a bit nervous with both at the beginning. “But now I just think ‘gubbins is gubbins’. If someone like Gareth Bale walked in the room now, I would just be like ‘do you want a cup of tea ’”Dr Mary Brown, former lecturer in occupational psychology at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, said people following their dreams rather than putting it off until the future was to be encouraged.“Doing something dferent other than just the job to pay the rent, is psychologically beneficial.“Many people have very ordinary jobs which don’t necessarily challenge them and doing a little bit of what they dream about takes them out of the mundane routine.“It reminds you that you have other talents.

It’s a question of time. Either option leads to the same result eventually – an independent Scotland.“I hope that Scotland can be a new radical, greener European nation that can avoid the mistakes of decades of Westminster conservatism.“That will be the Scottish Greens’ pitch as we build Scotland’s post-Brexit future.”Recent polls have indicated that support for independence and remaining in the UK are now neck and neck in Scotland as the Brexit crisis continues to engulf UK politics. Legislation is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament which would pave the way for a second referendum to be held, but Sturgeon had made it clear she would not hold such a vote without authority from Westminster which led to the  referendum. But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said Theresa May’s successor must take a strong line on the constitution.“Whatever your views on the new Prime Minister, the last thing Scotland needs is another isive independence referendum and more constitutional chaos,” she said.“Nicola Sturgeon will use this moment to launch a major new drive to ide us, capitalising on the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit. This is a time for cool heads and rational response, and the PM must not rise to the SNP’s desperate grievance tactics or stoop to the nationalists’ level.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also called for the referendum issue to be parked and for greater focus on Scottish public services.“The SNP laid out a blueprint for an independent Scotland in  and the public said no.

The situation has been branded “completely unsatisfactory” by opposition parties.It comes after recent analysis indicated that Edinburgh’s schools are falling behind other areas of Scotland – with just Boroughmuir making the top ten in the  Scottish school league tables.It means many youngsters in the capital will spend their entire six years at a secondary school without it being inspected. Education bosses insist they don’t use a “cyclical” approach to inspecting schools, but instead adopt a sampling model. Teaching representatives also insist many high-performing countries have no inspection system and Scotland could “learn from this approach” which places trust in teachers.But the revelations have prompted fresh concerns after Education Secretary John Swinney ditched high-profile reforms of the education system recently because of what he said was the strength of the current inspection regime.The Royal High School in the capital’s Barnton district has not been visited by inspectors since , according to figures published through Freedom on Information by the Scottish Government.Boroughmuir High School in Fountainbridge has not had a formal inspection since  – long before it moved into its new building last year. However, the school was ranked Scotland’s top state school last year in the Parent Power guide in the Sunday Times, based on Higher results.James Gillespie’s High School in the city centre \u2028was last inspected in , while Gracemount High School in the south of the city was last inspected six years ago.Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: “This is a completely unsatisfactory situation about which parents have every right to be angry.“One of the reasons used by John Swinney when he ditched his much heralded education reforms was his belief that the inspection programme was already providing more rigorous assessment of schools.“These statistics make plain, however, that many schools are not being regularly inspected so l don’t understand how he can possibly make that claim.“In some cases, pupils will go through a whole seven years of primary school or six years of secondary school, and yet their school will not be inspected.”Just  per cent of pupils in the capital attained five or more awards at SCQF level six, equivalent to Highers in the previous curriculum, recent analysis by the Herald newspaper found.But a spokeswoman for the EIS teaching union said: “Schools operate under the auspices of local authorities, all of which have quality assurance schemes in place. If there was a concern then HMIE could be contacted. It is worth noting, however, that in some high-performing systems, such as Finland, there is no national inspectorate. Scotland could learn from such systems where the key approach is one of trust in teachers.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"compulsory eye tests for drivers over 70 could be introduced","story":"Compulsory eye tests for drivers over  are being considered by the UK government to check they are safe to drive.The move comes three years after tests were recommended by an expert group.The call was repeated in the wake of the -year-old Duke of Edinburgh crashing into another car in January.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s.

I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type.

Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

He said it was his governments view it was not the right time for a poll - or to be calling for such a vote.The ambassador pointed out a border poll was provided for in the Good Friday Agreement andthe Secretary of State thought it would result in a vote for unication it would be an \"entirely legitimate exercise for whenever that would occur\".\"The view of the Irish government is that now is not the time to be pressing for or campaigning for such a border poll,\" he said.The SDLP has said a border poll should happen but after Brexit has been settled.Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald once said a border poll should not be held during the Brexit uncertainty. In August  she said she would prefer not to hold a border poll in the context of a “crash or very hard Brexit”, arguing it would be the wrong “climate” for such a debate.However, she later insisted her party wanted a poll \"as soon as possible\" and it has called for a poll on a number of occasions since.Ambassador ONeill said the view of his government was that finding agreement with Brexit should not be \"conflated\" with the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says an Irish border poll would degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic uOyfFiCU— BBC PoliticsJuly , Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says any attempts to blame Ireland for the impact of a no-deal Brexit would not be credible#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand] pic wEmPpAq— BBC PoliticsJuly , \"We think that would actually only perhaps degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit, and perhaps also inhibit our chances of getting the devolved institutions of Northern Ireland back up and running,\" he told the BBC.\"That is the priority of the government - getting those devolved institutions up and running and we are really hopeful we can make a break through there.\"Read More, Northern Ireland jobs at risk in no-deal Brexit, say Stormont officialsMr ONeill said a no-deal Brexit was a \"signicant risk\" which they had to prepare for it.

Which by definition made it dficult to actually find a solution to avoiding a hard border.“And it was the British parliament that has declined to approve the agreement that was negotiated by the British Government with the European Union.“Soyou take all of those three circumstances together, it seems to be a rather odd conclusion that it’s the EU that’s to blame.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds gather for loyalist flute band portrush concert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to take it more seriously and that can’t come fast enough.”The EPA report found that the levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air in Dublin represents a possible public health risk and may be exceeding the annual limits deemed safe by the European Union.Ms Hourigan said the group will continue to hold protests until measures to combat air pollution are introduced.Urgent action is required... Reducing traffic in the city works for everybody and it’s important on so many dferent groundsJanet Horner from the Dublin Cycling Campaign“When we’ve reached a point where we’re chocking on the air that we breathe, where children are developing increased cases of asthma, where people are struggling to breathe in the city, it is time to revisit this,” she added. “We are choking.”She added that other European countries were taking action but said Ireland was lagging behind, making changes “at a snail’s pace”.Janet Horner from the Dublin Cycling Campaign said: “We’re facing a climate emergency and we’re facing a public health emergency in terms of air pollution.“Urgent action is required… Reducing traffic in the city works for everybody and it’s important on so many dferent grounds.”Ms Horner said about , deaths a year are caused by air pollution in Ireland and that figure does not include all those impacted by respiratory illnesses.Nitrogen Dioxidelevels in Dublin, due to traffic, pose a public health risk.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot.

There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

I just missed it on the wrong side too many times, but all in all, itrsquos a pretty good week.ldquoItrsquos a step in the right direction for sure. It shows I can compete out here.ldquoMy confidence has been pretty high, but itrsquos definitely going to boost that a little.ldquoItrsquos my first time being in contention on the European Tour so Irsquom proud of the way I handled myself on and off the golf course.Sharvin, who turned professional after being a member of the winning Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team in , received huge support from friends and family who travelled to the Co Clare venue.Ranked th in the world before the championship began, Sharvin, who mainly plies his trade on the Challenge Tour, cut the figure of someone who belongs on a bigger stage.He has a classic swing, drives superbly, has a tidy short game and possesses a superb temperament.ldquoI really felt like I took it one shot at a time out there and did that really well, he enthused.A top ten finish would have earned Sharvin a ticket into this weekrsquos Scottish Open andthe potential to claim one of the three spots on offer to next weekrsquos Open at Portrush.ldquoIrsquove tried not to get too bogged down with results and outcome, and thatrsquos just going to come from the process of what Irsquove been doing the last year and a half, trying to get to the next level, he explained.ldquoI know therersquos more there and that will give me confidence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Dee and Mackenzie never take a breather  ","story":"THE Murray family began the first of what was to prove an historic and richly rewarding week in athletics circles when they took part in the latest North Down Track and Field event on Tuesday night at Bangor.Mackenzie really set the standard for what was to follow when, after competing in the kg shot putt in which he scored . metres, he then proceeded to set a new PB .. in the ,m race in which he was second overall, in a field of  which contained several top quality adult runners.Dee, meantime, was in equally good form setting a new PB of .. for the k race, was only  seconds behind the race winner.Lucy OrsquoNeill also took part in the m U- girlsrsquo sprint and later scored an ever-improving .m in the U- girlsrsquo shot putt, an encouraging warm up for next weekendrsquos All Ireland TF championships in Tullamore.GreyabbeyAlready one of the most prolic and competitive duos anywhere, not only in the number of races participated in, but in terms of miles travelled to meetings, the father and son pairing then made the trip to Greyabbey on Friday night to take part in the two races there.Dee opted for the k and Mackenzie, having no choice, as the rules presently restrict him to the k distance, gave it a real go. He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The new legislation is intended to, for the first time, ban NDAs from being used to stop people disclosing information to the police, doctors or lawyers.Currently, NDAs cannot prevent people from whistleblowing in the public interest.The crackdown will ensure that employers make clear the limitations of the confidentiality clause in plain English, the business minister said.It will also provide more advice to iniduals over the clauses and introduce new enforcement measures to deal with agreements which fail to meet the legal requirements.Ms Tolhurst said: ldquoThe vast majority of businesses comply with the law and use NDAs legitimately ndash from protecting commercially-sensitive information to preventing information being shared with competitors.ldquoAs we have seen in the news recently, there are a handful of employers using NDAs to cover up criminal acts in the workplace, including sexual harassment, assault and racist discrimination.ldquoThe new legislation will stamp out misuse, tackle unacceptable workplace cultures, protect iniduals and create a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law.Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality  Human Rights Commission, said: ldquoHarassment and discrimination should never go unanswered and unchallenged just because victims are prevented from speaking out.ldquoThis new legislation will help to end ambiguity about employeesrsquo rights and stop the misuse of NDAs to protect corporate and personal reputations and obstruct justice..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New laws to clamp down on workplace  ugagging clauses u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parliament  be updated Monmdash Jeremy HuntJuly , On Saturday, Mr Hunt said Iranrsquos actions raise ldquovery serious questions about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.The Foreign Secretary, speaking after a meeting of the Governmentrsquos emergency committee Cobra, said the vessel was seized in Omani waters in ldquoclear contravention of international law.He told reporters inside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that, having spoken to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zar, Tehran saw the situation as a ldquotit for tat following the detention of Grace  in Gibraltar. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zar has spoken with UK counterpart, Jeremy Hunt,  --ldquoNothing could be further from the truth, he said.ldquoGrace  was detained legally in Gibraltarian waters because it was carrying oil, against EU sanctions, to Syria, and thatrsquos why the Gibraltarian authorities acted totally with respect to due process and totally within the law.ldquoStena Impero was seized in Omani waters in clear contravention of international law, it was then forced to sail into Iran.ldquoThis is totally and utterly unacceptable. It raises very serious questions about the security of British shipping, and indeed international shipping, in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated about what ldquofurther measures the Government will take on Monday, adding that the threat level had been raised to three. -- --ldquoOur priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation.ldquoThatrsquos why I reached out to the Iranian foreign minister, thatrsquos why due process in Gibraltar continues.ldquoWe need to see due process happening in Iran as well, we need to see the illegal seizing of a British flagged vessel reversed, we need that ship released, and we continue to be very concerned about the safety and welfare of the  crew members.The Foreign Office earlier summoned the Iranian charge drsquoaffaires, Mohsen Omidzamani, following the incident.Iran has directly linked the seizure of the vessel with Britainrsquos role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --A spokesman for IranrsquosCouncil was quoted as saying ldquothe rule of reciprocal action is well known in international law and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an ldquoillegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was ldquoviolating international maritime rules and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK Government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping, and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident. A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at about .pm on Friday.Communication with the ship was later re-established and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation. -- --On Friday evening, Mr Hunt said he had spoken to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the situation, and President Donald Trump said the US would be ldquoworking with the UK.The Foreign Secretary said the US had a ldquodferent approach to dealing with Iran, and that the UK would continue to support the Iran nuclear deal.France and Germany joined condemnation of Iranrsquos actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ministers  uconsidering freezing Iran assets u following tanker seizure article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
