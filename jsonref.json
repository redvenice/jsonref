This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Seven of 10 survive and were brought to Britain in the 17th century by the Prince of Wales, later Charles I.They remained in the royal collection until Queen Victoria loaned them to the South Kensington Museum in 1865 in memory of Prince Albert. They have remained stars of the museum, now the V\u0026ampA, ever since.The gallery where they hang was originally designed for the museum’s Indian art collection. In 1950 the cartoons were transferred there and it has proved “the perfect space” said Ana Debenedetti, the lead curator of the Raphael Project.“It has almost the same dimensions as the Sistine Chapel, only 2 sq metres of difference. It is a dramatic gallery which allows a meditative feeling and this is really what we want to enhance.”The Raphael Court was last refurbished between 1992-96 and a refresh was due, given that the natural lifecycle of such spaces is 25 years.The fact that 2020 is the the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death gave an added impetus.Debenedetti said the new gallery would have state-of-the art lighting and a darker colour on the walls to help focus visitors’ eyes on the cartoons’ vibrant palette. There will also be enhanced interpretation including high-definition, infrared and 3D scans of the cartoons.Because the cartoons cannot be moved the work will go on around them from 27 January, with the hope of being completed by October. That would coincide with a major show planned by the National Gallery to open on 3 October.Debenedetti said the seven cartoons, each measuring 5 metres wide and 3.5 metres high, were “a unique Renaissance treasure, both in terms of aesthetic value and technical achievement”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3392cdf83cdceacba8d22d87f1fd5fa6963ab4b/0_72_1348_808/master/1348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de02aaa2def53de6549aaf8c4605b277","title":"the fantasy figures of txema yeste in pictures","story":"Born in Spain, Yeste began his career working for newspapers.

The authors of a 2017 study which found that reading science fiction “makes you stupid” have conducted a follow-up that found that it’s only bad sci-fi that has this effect: a well-written slice of sci-fi will be read just as thoroughly as a literary story.Two years ago, Washington and Lee University professors Chris Gavaler and Dan Johnson published a paper in which they revealed that when readers were given a sci-fi story peopled by aliens and androids and set on a space ship, as opposed to a similar one set in reality, “the science fiction setting triggered poorer overall reading” and appeared to “predispose readers to a less effortful and comprehending mode of reading – or what we might term non-literary reading”.But after critics suggested that merely changing elements of a mainstream story into sci-fi tropes did not make for a quality story, Gavaler and Johnson decided to revisit the research. This time, 204 participants were given one of two stories to read: both were called “Ada” and were identical apart from one word, to provide the strictest possible control. The “literary” version begins: “My daughter is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.” The science-fiction variant begins: “My robot is standing behind the bar, polishing a wine glass against a white cloth.”In what Gavaler and Johnson call “a significant departure” from their previous study, readers of both texts scored the same in comprehension, “both accumulatively and when ided into the comprehension subcategories of mind, world, and plot”.The presence of the word “robot” did not reduce merit evaluation, effort reporting, or objective comprehension scores, they write in their previous study, these had been reduced by the sci-fi setting. “This difference between studies is presumably a result of differences between our two science-fiction texts,” they say.Gavaler said he was “pretty startled” by the result.“It turns out our first study didn’t reveal much about sci-fi generally but about what we would now have to call ‘non-literary sci-fi’. The text we used for our new study is instead ‘literary sci-fi’, and it didn’t trigger poor reading at all. Not even when it was introduced with a paragraph describing the story as non-literary. Readers basically ignored that intro and engaged actively with the text itself anyway,” he said. “I assume there were plenty of readers in the sample groups who don’t like sci-fi, but it didn’t matter because they still responded to the literary qualities of the story.

Roughly akin to Big Foot, “yowie hunters” regularly claim sightings of the creature and have become their own sub-genre of curiosity story.The inclusion of thongs – Australia’s term for the flip-flop – may also create confusion for visitors.The promotion is also a boon for American-owned company Arnott’s Biscuits and the Seventh Day Adventist Church-owned company Sanitarium the coins feature the Arnott’s-owned biscuit the Iced VoVo and Sanitarium’s breakfast cereal Weet-Bix. Other brands, including Vegemite and the Zooper Dooper ice block, also feature.The township of Xantippe – located about 240 kilometres north of Perth in Western Australia with a population of 20 people – was included because it is the only town in Australia which starts with X.Despite being marketed as a hunt, the coins are only available as change at Australia Post stores, leading one Twitter user to ask the obvious question: “what can you actually buy from Australia Post?”“Need some new stationery? A phone charger? Some lollies? Maybe an airbed or a sewing machine?” Australia Post replied.“There are a surprising array of gifts and goodies at your local Post Office these days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318b466cd7df4b71079683e9f955dea2726ad4ab/0_468_3918_2350/master/3918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4723a60ea4fcde59593709cdba7a455d","title":"crispin odey denies backing no deal brexit shorting opportunity","story":"Hedge fund manager says he is optimistic about UK and claims as to motivations are ‘rubbish’Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who is a leading backer of a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson, has dismissed claims his support is motivated by an opportunity to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound as “absolute rubbish”.Odey told the  he was optimistic about the prospects for the UK after Brexit, denied influencing strategy at No 10 and said his fund had an overall “neutral” position on UK stocks.The founder of Odey Asset Management said he had spoken to Boris Johnson only once since he became Conservative leader, “two days after, to say congratulations”. He added: “I am an observer. When it comes to his strategy, I am not involved.”Over the weekend, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, questioned the political connections of some hedge fund managers backing a no-deal Brexit, and the former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson argued he was right to do so. Responding to the criticisms on Monday, Odey said: “It’s absolute rubbish. It really is. Politics doesn’t drive markets. Markets are very bad at observing political events because they are not monetary.In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, the government rejected claims from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, that Johnson risked a conflict of interest if a no-deal Brexit benefited his friends and donors.“Isn’t there a danger the promotion of a no-deal scare by the prime minister, resulting in profiteering by his friends and donors, could be seen as a conflict of interest by any standard and contrary to the ministerial code?” McDonnell asked.Odey donated £10,000 to Johnson’s Conservative leadership campaign and has given almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns in the past. The wealth of Odey and his wife, Nichola Pease, has been put at £775m by the Sunday Times rich list.Odey said he supported holding a general election, arguing “the problem is that this parliament was never set up to deal with Brexit”.A fresh election, he said, might result in a parliament that was “more closely aligned to opinion in the country, so not 80:20 but 50:50. It is not good for the country that we live on a knife edge every single day and everyone wants to postpone.”“Most people’s view of the UK is that ‘it’s not going to get any better’. My view is that, if we get out, we will have all this invigoration of things we have got to do, including reforming the constitution. There are parts to the constitution that need reform, including the upper house, which is far too large,” he said.“The idea that Boris is a tyrant doesn’t make sense, if you look at the experience of his time as mayor of London. He is an enterprise man.”Asked why Hammond and Macpherson might question his motives, Odey responded: “It’s the deep state. They are feeling, for the first time, a little bit frustrated.”He backed a no-deal Brexit, he said, because alternative methods of leaving the EU would lumber the UK with the equivalent of unattractive “non-voting shares”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd74689610a1589ea7424826a6f7d3a170c209c/0_64_4696_2818/master/4696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0feaffd9a3e824ba12212b07f2352ee4","title":"uk house prices brexit factory output eurozone business live","story":"British manufacturers are cutting employment levels at the fastest pace since 2013, despite a renewed surge in stockpilingStephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, says today’s UK manufacturing PMI report is pretty bad.Firms should check they have enough working capital to ride out the slowdown, he warns, saying “We expected grim news from this month’s UK Manufacturing PMI readings and that unfortunately came to fruition, albeit with marginal improvement on last month’s performance. “A backdrop of global trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and concerns regarding the slowing global economic growth continue to weigh heavily on the industry, with Europe, our leading trading partner, far from immune. Indeed Europe posted their worst performance since October 2012. “Lower orders for new work, job losses and reduced investment levels due to prolonged uncertainty paints a rather bleak set of conditions which are unlikely to abate any time soon. This reinforces the importance for manufacturers to ensure that their working capital and supply chains are as robust as possible to weather these challenging times.”Steve Harris of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says some UK factories are focused on short-term Brexit problems, rather than looking further ahead:“Short-term Brexit headwinds continue to dominate domestically, but it is clear that weaker international demand and trade wars globally are impacting on growth. The danger remains this causes manufacturers to hold back investment and become myopic losing sight of medium and long-term growth opportunities.Encouragingly, anecdotal feedback and our own research suggests this isn’t happening everywhere, but that doesn’t remove the fact resources are being applied to short-term planning to tackle the immediate challenges.Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, fears that the UK manufacturing sector is sliding into recession.Here’s his take on today’s PMI report:Output, new orders and employment all fell further as rising political, trade and economic uncertainties exacerbated concerns about Brexit.“The rate of job losses accelerated to a six-and-a- half-year high, highlighting how manufacturers are increasingly seeking to cut costs. Similarly, the investment goods sector was especially hard hit in September, seeing the sharpest drops in production and new business, as clients reined in capital spending while conditions remained volatile. Newsflash: UK factories are cutting jobs at the fastest pace in six years, despite getting a boost from Brexit stockpiling.Data firm Markit reports that output shrank again last month, as the downturn at British manufacturing continues.Bosses reported that output, new orders, and new export business all fell further in September. Employment levels also declined, at the fastest pace since February 2013.Companies reported that capacity had been reduced due to lower demand, efforts to control costs, redundancies and natural wastage. Job losses were widespread across the sector, with declines seen across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries and at SMEs and large-sized producers. Economic uncertainty, the weak European economy, and the trade war between Washington and Beijing all appear to be hurting the UK’s industrial base.But there are also signs that companies are preparing for the looming Brexit deadline. Stocks of purchases and input buying volumes also rose for the first time in recent months, as some companies restarted their preparations for Britain to leave the EU.This lifted the manufacturing PMI up to 48.3 in September, from August’s seven-month low of 47.4.The most remarkable story of the morning is that the chief operating officer of Credit Suisse has resigned, over a spying operation against the bank’s own outgoing head of wealth management.Switzerland’s second-biggest bank said Pierre-Olivier Bouée has stepped down after private detectives were hired to tail Iqbal Khan, the bank’s former head of wealth management.An investigation into the scandal by the Homburger law firm on behalf of the board cleared Tidjane Thiam, Credit Suisse’s chief executive, and found that Bouée alone was responsible for the botched surveillance of Khan, who left in July and later joined arch-rival UBS.The surveillance led to a confrontation in the streets of Zurich last month between Khan and the private detectives.The decision to put Khan under surveillance is quite astonishing, and obviously backfired when Khan spotted he was being spied on. CS may have worried that he could poach bankers and clients for UBS - where he starts work today!But even though Thaim has been cleared, the affair does raise questions about his leadership. He and Khan had what the FT calls an “acrimonious relationship”, due to a series of domestic rows over their adjoining properties in Zurich. One such spat apparently centred on some trees planted on the Thaim residence...Ouch! The slump in the eurozone’s manufacturing sector has deepened, hit by the US-China trade war and Brexit.Data firm Markit has reported that factory output and new orders both fell sharply again last month.This dragged its Eurozone Manufacturing PMI down to 45.7, from 47.0 in August and its lowest reading since October 2012. Anything below 50 shows contraction, and such a weak reading suggests the eurozone is weakening.Germany suffered particularly badly, with the weakest PMI in 123 months. Italy, Spain and Austria also suffered contractions.Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said:“The health of the eurozone manufacturing sector went from bad to worse in September, with the PMI survey indicating the steepest downturn for nearly seven years and sending increasingly grim signals for the fourth quarter.....Businesses also remain downbeat about the year ahead, with optimism around a seven-year low amid trade war worries, signs of slowing global economic growth and geopolitical concerns, including heightened anxiety over a disruptive Brexit. High street bakery chain Greggs says it’s taking steps to prevent disruption from a no-deal Brexit.Greggs told shareholders this morning that:We are preparing for the potential impact of the UK’s departure from the European Union by building stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected by disruption to the flow of goods into the UK. Britons are already worried about disruption to key medicines after a disorderly Brexit, without the added threat of running low on steak bakes and vegan sausage rolls.In a trading update, Greggs also warned that its labour and food input costs are being pushed up. But it is pressing on with its autumn range, including the popular Pumpkin Spice Latte, and some new post-4pm meal deals (including pizza and a drink for £2).If people aren’t moving house, then they’re not buying new carpets and furniture.The period has been impacted by the record temperatures seen over the key August bank holiday weekend and the increased political and economic uncertainty that the UK is currently facing.Britain’s house price slowdown is firmly centred on London, as this map shows:Guy Harrington, CEO of property lender Glenhawk, blames Brexit for the slowdown in house price growth:If these were ‘normal’ times, we’d expect the favourable underlying drivers of low interest rates and high employment to be supporting a buoyant market.However these are unprecedented times and the record that is playing housing growth is stuck until the needle bounces over the Brexit bump, although that assumes that’s all it is.”Lucy Pendleton of independent estate agents James Pendleton points out that house prices have been lagging inflation for over a year:“Such low growth means September is set to be the 14th month in a row in which property has lost value in real terms. “What this means is that there’s no mistaking this trend as a flash in the pan and it is being solidly reflected in buyer and vendor behaviour, particularly in London.Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, fears that the housing market will weaken in the months ahead:“It’s a miracle that the market is holding up as well as it is given the level of political turmoil. Low supply and stock levels continue to support prices while cheap mortgages and the strong jobs market are steeling buyers’ resolve. The resilience of the property market looks set to be tested like never before in the final quarter of 2019. “To say it’s tin hat time is an understatement.”Iain McKenzie, CEO of the Guild of Property Professionals, reckons the housing market will pick up once Brexit is resolved.When the extension of Brexit was announced there was a spike in activity in the market, which again reiterates the fact that it is uncertainty holding buyers back rather than a lack of interest. Once activity starts to increase and buyer confidence returns, which it will, prices will start back on an upward trajectory.”Weak house price growth is obviously good news for those hoping to get onto the housing ladder.But despite the slowdown, houses are still relatively unaffordable, as this chart shows:This would obviously get worse if the Bank of England raised interest rates - although they’re more likely to cut them in the current climate.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.With just 30 days until Brexit, the UK housing market is being dragged down by uncertainty and worry.Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, blames two factors -- the weakening global economy, and the ongoing Brexit saga. “Indicators of UK economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. However, the slowdown has centred on business investment – household spending has been more resilient, supported by steady gains in employment and real earnings.As these charts show, house price inflation has been dropping steadily since the UK voted to leave the EU:More to follow! We could get more grim news from Britain’s factory sector this morning. September’s manufacturing PMI report is expected to show that output shrank again across the UK last month.The eurozone’s factories also probably suffered a torrid month, hit by recession worries and the US-China trade war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2db8fa9823a0627c80a1bc0ff3ec7ca98dd5dfe/539_102_2669_1601/master/2669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=780a793e6ea61b3eb37fd460c573f005","title":"greta thunbergs defiance upsets the patriarchy and its wonderful","story":"The 16-year-old climate-emergency activist refuses to kowtow to old men, and it has left them squirmingSometimes you don’t realise how conditioned you are until you meet someone who isn’t.

Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not “sexy” enough. Yes, really.

At last there’s hope for a safety net to lift people out of povertyCritics call it inhumane. Even its supporters talk of its colossal delays and waste. Now, universal credit has been given another blow as Labour announced the system would be scrapped under a Jeremy Corbyn government. Labour has not yet disclosed what this would fully entail – rather than a total scrap, it appears the basic structure would remain. But a £3bn package of emergency reforms seems enough to make the new model unrecognisable: from removing the tax-credit “rape clause” (whereby women have to show their third or subsequent child was conceived as a result of rape to be exempt from the two-child limit on receiving the credit), to introducing interim payments to cushion people from the debt-creating five-week wait.That the party has committed to scrap the system is a hugely significant step. The underfunding of Britain’s safety net has now gone beyond critical levels. Over the past decade, multibillion-pound cuts, combined with a toxic anti-welfare narrative, has upended the meaning of social security. Humiliation has replaced help, punishment put in place of compassion.Universal credit has in many ways come to define the cruel incompetence of the austerity era, in which social security – rather than providing a safety net for people in time of need – actively pushes them into crisis. Just this month, research by Unite showed claimants were routinely going hungry – more than four in 10 have been forced to use a food bank – and are left unable to pay bills. Some were even suicidal.The government’s pledge that this was all worth it, as the system would “make work pay”, has looked ever more hollow as workers graft full time only to find themselves at risk of homelessness, and poverty and inequality spreads.And yet despite the vast problems that plague universal credit, campaigners and experts have been torn over how best to respond now it has already partly rolled out, costing billions of pounds of public money. Last year, the National Audit Office claimed “there is no practical alternative” to continuing with it, while the Joseph Rowntree Foundation cautioned against causing further upheaval for those who depend on benefits to get by.But policymaking can be about the heart, as well as the head. I’ve spoken to people on universal credit for years, many of them battling ill health while scraping together their last pound for a hot meal. Amid it all, they often tell me one hope: that Corbyn would commit to ending the system. For the families pushed into debt, it’s acknowledgement from politicians that their pain matters.Universal credit is often talked of in terms of design flaws but this is inaccurate. “Flaws” suggest an error, a shortcoming, that was made by mistake. In fact, leaving people without money for longer than a month was deliberately engineered to model a pay packet (despite the fact that in a modern economy, many people are not paid this way and claimants often have no savings to fall back on). Similarly, it was a political choice to launch what at any time would be a deeply complex system while cutting billions from the welfare budget. That a terminally ill man had to take the government to court after being pushed into hardship by being transferred to universal credit gives an insight into how low its architects sunk. For even more significance, though, look beyond the headlines and to the detail. As well as scrapping universal credit, Labour have also pledged to end the two-child limit – which Labour says could lift 300,000 children from poverty – benefit sanctions and the benefit cap, while entirely replacing the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) with the newly named Department for Social Security.The policies that have come out of the DWP in recent years have been rotten, but it is the culture that has created the stench: one that has demonised those who need help from the state, and done all it can to shirk its duties to them.Whether it is universal credit or the benefit cap, Labour’s platform marks a chance to depart from the George Osborne era of blaming “scroungers” – to say policies that push people into destitution based on little more than class prejudice have no place in social security, and to shift the narrative that so-called “welfare waste” actually saves the NHS, child social care, and housing bills. There has rarely been a more crucial time to rebuild a social security system that the public can have faith in – one that provides a comprehensive safety net that lifts people out of poverty and, in turn, creates a healthier society. Social security should not mean suffering. It is a reflection of how benefit claimants have been treated in recent years that such a message could ever be contentious."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c449c5ce6b7a8e4fc30968928bf8bc47824ad1a5/536_898_5112_3066/master/5112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09fe2fb6ca890c272c43d8207bd0d723","title":"most people avoid ugly animals im obsessed with them","story":"Growing up in rural Australia, I found joy in the weird creatures around me – and finding out why they had evolved that way. Now I’ve illustrated a whole children’s book about themThe surinam toad is an unusual creature to behold: it has an extremely flat, splat-like body, with a posterior packed with large pores full of babies. It’s as though somewhere during evolution, it took a wrong turn – and then got run over.But of course, the adaptation has an intelligent purpose. By carrying her eggs on her back, the mother is able to lay flat against her surroundings, protecting her spawn from predators until they are ready for the world.If you suffer from trypophobia (the fear of small, tightly packed holes), look away now.The surinam toad is a perfect example of one of my obsessions: ugly animals. What may be a distressingly hideous feature to humans often belies evolutionary genius, which fascinates me so much that I wrote and illustrated a whole children’s book full of them.Most people spend their lives avoiding being associated with anything regarded as “ugly” I find myself being drawn towards them. And drawing them.I’m 23 now but I grew up in my family’s home just outside of Port Macquarie in Australia, in the rural suburb of Sancrox. From an early age I found so much joy in the weird and wonderful creatures around me, from the frequent visits of Antechinus marsupials to the bandy-bandy snakes, goannas in the garden, and possums in the trees. We had a vast range of pets too – miniature ponies and donkeys, among them.Our home was always decorated with paintings by Mum, and my sister and I were fortunate enough to inherit her artistic skill. I wasn’t sure what to do with it after studying art in high school – until Mum came across a unique course: I could get a bachelor’s degree in natural history illustration.During my honours year I researched the connections between conservation and aesthetics, to discover the impact of an animal’s appearance on how willing humans were to assist with its survival.Large and impressive animals found in safari parks or reservations, including tigers, lions and elephants, are considered “charismatic megafauna” owing to their popularity with the public. As a result, they tend to receive more press, better benefits and more donations – while less popular or “ugly” animals are left behind.In his 2011 article, The New Noah’s Ark, the Canadian veterinary research scientist Ernie Small compared the $2m Coca-Cola had committed to save polar bears – and the $125m commitment to the whooping crane made by a joint Canada-US recovery plan – with money promised to help endangered frogs and toads, who receive nowhere near that much.“Aesthetic and commercial standards have become the primary determinants of which species in the natural world deserve conservation,” he wrote. “Accordingly, the world’s bioersity is being beautified by selective conservation of attractive species, while the plight of the overwhelming majority of species is receiving limited attention.”Species that possess human tendencies, infant-like features, vibrant colours, symmetry and impressive proportion – or offer something we can use, such as food, medicine or clothing – are almost always going to appeal more to us. But an animal like the endangered aye-aye suffers in comparison.To draw the aye-aye, one must take into consideration their coarse fur, bulging eyes, scrawny single finger and over-all rat-like appearance, while keeping the superstition that surrounds it in the back of one’s mind: if an aye-aye points at you with its long finger, the legend goes, you’ve been cursed with an imminent death.It sounds ridiculous, but myths like these have a direct impact on their population. We need to understand this incredible species, not be afraid of it we need to educate others on why the creature has evolved like this. It is one of only a few species to use a technique called “percussive foraging”: their large ears help them hear insects inside the trees their sharp teeth gnaw holes in the wood and their eerily long index finger and claw helps them spear grubs found in the holes they’ve made, for a tasty meal.The helmeted hornbill is another one: critically endangered owing to land clearing for palm oil plantations, and poaching for its magnificent red ivory casque. In West Kalimantan, 6,000 birds were killed for trade purposes in 2013 alone, to create carved ornaments and jewellery from their horns.The helmeted hornbill is wonderful to illustrate, with its enormous size, outrageous beak and textured neck. I used a range of painting techniques to capturethis weird yet wonderful bird.I hope my book will introduce others to a broader range of species – and help us care about them, regardless of how they look.• The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Ugly Animals by Sami Bayly is out now through LothianHachette"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b95c40221b5df15866d1829e144b9520800f2335/0_288_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be77b962a2a8654b471d9365de839e7c","title":"challenging islamophobia muslim bashing event conference conservatives","story":"Seven years ago I was chairman of the Conservative party. At the time, under the leadership of David Cameron, it felt like an organisation that was striving to become more erse and more inclusive, and one that was taking steps to improve the representation and influence of people from different backgrounds. Cameron told me he wanted to change the face of the party, and the faces within the party.How things have changed. We now have a leadership that openly demonises Muslim women, fails to acknowledge the extent of racism within the party’s ranks, and uses language over Brexit that stokes hatred and deepens isions. And this weekend, in Manchester, we had a meeting at the party conference that brought out the worst aspects of this atmosphere of intolerance.Headlined as Challenging “Islamophobia”, at first glance it seemed to be the kind of event I could sign up to: who wouldn’t want to support minorities under attack? But then I noticed that some of the panellists had at times said, let us say, dubious things about Muslims.I immediately raised my concerns with the MP Nusrat Ghani, who was also billed as a panellist. I asked her why the party conference would be hosting an event dominated by such people. She assured me it would be balanced, and that the speakers would be challenged. But it now appears that exactly what I’d feared has happened and that the meeting became a Muslim-bashing fest. I am appalled at both its content and its conduct.Trevor Phillips, the chair, opened the event by telling Muslims what they should be concerned about. The conversation then majored on Muslim extremists, Islamists, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt. From sharia to burqas, terrorism to misogyny, the panellists emphasised anything but the real lived experiences of British Muslims. Finally, he told the panellists they had “30 seconds on whether we should have a definition and an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party”. “Very briefly,” he then emphasised.I now realise why the event’s headline had quotation marks. It wasn’t a meeting to challenge Islamophobia, but to challenge the very concept of it – suggesting it to be a dangerous, concocted idea being “weaponised” by extremists and a tool to shut down criticism of Islam. It ignored the harrowing tales of discrimination and prejudice I’d heard from victims as part of the parliamentary report Islamophobia Defined.When I first read reports on the gathering, I felt sick to my stomach at what went on. Later, as I listened to a recording of the event, I felt deep fear.Fear that a mainstream party has so lost its way that it would host such an event. Fear at the disingenuous way the Islamophobia report was presented, with no parliamentarian involved in producing it given a chance to respond. But, most particularly, fear at the manner in which British Muslims who dared question this panto of an event were treated.Even more disturbing was how the panel tried to shore up their anti-racism credentials by denouncing antisemitism within the Labour party. It was the worst kind of hypocrisy. I thought this terrible playing of “race politics’ was confined to the ide-and-rule practices of the colonial past. I have been raising the issue of Islamophobia within my party for nearly four years and have often been asked whether it is “as bad as Labour antisemitism”. I have refused to engage in this debate, because those who do are no friends of any minority. I will not play “Muslim victimhood” versus “Jewish victimhood” or any other form of racism – those of us who truly care about equality believe all need protection.Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, described the Conservatives recently as “an extreme rightwing faction” the MP Sam Gyimah said he felt “an outcast” in an increasingly intolerant party. I have personally tried to battle on, painstakingly presenting complaints, citing hundreds of incidents of Islamophobia as evidence, yet despite Boris Johnson’s public promise of an inquiry we are no further along the road in dealing with the bigotry and racism within our ranks.

Local authorities would carry out regular “health checks” instead, while inspectors would be called in for more in-depth visits. What do teachers and parents think? Should Ofsted be abolished?maths teacher, the Beacon school, Banstead, SurreyYes. Ofsted creates an environment of fear, anxiety and worry for teachers. To prepare for an Ofsted visit, you may have to do a lot of tick-box exercises, regimented things that don’t add value but help a school to look good. It inevitably adds to a teacher’s workload.Plus the current system is so punitive. There’s no supportive element to it. An external body comes in and passes judgment on a school. A bad judgment can feel like a prison sentence, involving years of seriously irrelevant work and pressure from headteachers. That has a negative effect on classroom teachers and, inevitably, students.Schools should be held accountable but they should be supported as well as evaluated, ideally by other school leaders with local expertise, as part of a continuous improvement process. Context matters and, unlike Ofsted inspectors, local teachers will understand the school’s demographic and its history over the years.Schools should be told: these are your strengths, these are your weaknesses and these are some brilliant schools in your geographical area, we’re going to support you to work together collaboratively.I would not shy away from someone coming in regularly to tell me how I can improve. I’m a professional, I want to do my job better. But I want someone who’s going to put an arm around me and walk on that journey with me, someone who will support me, not just tell me all the things I’m not doing right.consultant and former headteacher, who resigned on TV in the BBC documentary SchoolNo, because accountability is important – and we could spend a lot of unnecessary time restructuring the accountability system in line with what Labour is saying. However, there is too much human interpretation in the inspection framework and I don’t think it should continue in its current format. What needs to change is Ofsted’s job, so inspectors are no longer trying to root out under-performance, inadequacy and failure.Ofsted needs to be a lot more realistic about what it can accurately, effectively and specifically hold schools accountable for. I don’t think it’s feasible or possible to inspect everything a school does accurately, and then reduce it down to a one-word judgment.So I agree with Labour: we should either remove the judgment categories or stop trying to summarise the work that schools do with one word that is then used as a stick to beat schools with.We’d be better off if Ofsted judged schools annually on outcomes it is accurately able to quantify. The focus of the inspections, however, should be detached from the dataset and identify where practice is good and needs to improve. The inspection would then take on a completely different flavour, and use a broad body of research, evidence and training to support schools and help them improve.Yes. I chose to send my child to a school that had just been told by Ofsted it “requires improvement”. Although I thought the judgment was absolutely right, I saw at close-hand the effect it had. The school lost a lot of pupils, it lost money and had to get rid of experienced staff, which meant it was harder for it to improve.In other countries you don’t have this totally punitive system. Teachers don’t need to be whipped into doing their jobs better. I think teachers genuinely want to provide the best quality education. It’s crucial to have inspections, but one- or two-day inspections are too short – you can’t get under the skin of the school. Nor can you accurately sum up a school with a one-word judgment. We need a way of assessing schools that results in a much more positive relationship and takes into account the wellbeing of students and staff and how inclusive the school is. At the moment, some schools discourage admission of children with additional needs because it affects their results.Support for school improvement has to be at a local level and come from experts who know the particular challenges of the schools in their area. I agree it would be good to have the option of more formal and less formal inspections by inspectors who are independent of the local authority – but those inspectors should have a constructive mindset. I’d like to see a network of successful former headteachers visiting schools regularly and providing ideas and connections. We need, as Angela Rayner says, a much more collaborative model of education, rather than pitting schools against each other.Yes, but only if something better can replace it. I’m not sure whether Ofsted can be successfully overhauled, and every educational institution has to be accountable for its standards. I also think the safeguarding of children should be checked every year.What Ofsted does at the moment isn’t necessarily bad practice but it’s not contextualised. I’d like to see local audits every year by a former teacher or teaching specialist who understands the local area. They should take into account whether the school is surrounded by grammar schools or in an area of huge social deprivation, and consider whether the local authority is effective and if the level of funding is appropriate for that school.I’d love to get rid of judgments, as Labour proposes. At the moment, the process doesn’t feel very human. A one-word judgment is too simplistic, because even schools in special measures have fantastic stuff going on.But I’d worry about Labour’s proposal to give more control to local authorities. If you’ve got a really strong local authority, that’s fine. But in some areas, schools can be left to rot.I’d like to see schools have more of a say in who comes to see them. There are some absolutely cracking inspectors out there and I wouldn’t want to stop them doing their job. When they turn up and support you, and provide really useful feedback, it’s magic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7680b312250f1e788f8834b1c78ab644c3b4ca95/0_329_5804_3482/master/5804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3125860b7c6c0037c81140654788f6","title":"oxford professors children refused visas to join her in uk","story":"US family split as Home Office makes it increasingly difficult for overseas academics to work in UK universitiesAmber Murrey, an American academic, was “ecstatic” about being appointed associate professor in geography at Oxford University last year. But the dream turned sour two weeks ago when the Home Office refused to grant visas for her two daughters, aged four and nine, to live with her in the UK.Dr Murrey used an immigration lawyer to make sure the visa applications for her daughters, who have US passports, went smoothly, and was not anticipating a problem. Her husband has business commitments overseeing property renovations in Cameroon, where he is from, and the couple had included joint written consent for their daughters to live with her in Oxford.“When I read those three unemotional sentences saying they were denying my children entry to the UK I felt complete disbelief,” she says. “I had already packed the girls’ bags and bought their school uniforms. It is insane that you can have a legal document with both parents’ consent to have the children with their mother and they simply say no, that can’t happen.”Her case will add to a tide of anger among academics, who say the Home Office’s hostile immigration environment is making it difficult for talented people from abroad to forge an academic career in the UK.This is the second time in a month that the Home Office has refused a visa to an American academic based at Oxford University. Last month Education  reported that Dr Elizabeth Ford, a music historian about to start a fellowship at Oxford, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK, because the Home Office said it had granted her last visa erroneously.Young overseas academics say that universities are now so frightened of the tough new visa regime that, in some cases, they are automatically rejecting international candidates for jobs they should be eligible for.Dr Murrey, an expert on social change in Africa, who has published widely and previously held positions at universities in Cairo, Massachusetts and Ethiopia, took up her post in Oxford last year. Without proof of residency she couldn’t set up schooling or somewhere to live in advance, so the couple decided she should establish a base in Oxford before moving the family. While she has been returning to Cameroon to see her daughters and husband in the university holidays, she says this has been an emotional strain.“It has been really hard, because I need to spend more time with my daughters but I am wary of being out of the UK for too long in case it jeopardises the terms of my tier 2 visa,” she says.The news has hit the family hard. Murrey says: “My nine-year-old had been so excited about her new school, and our apartment near a meadow. After I told her their visas had been denied she told me: ‘I know why they rejected me, it’s because I’ve been misbehaving this week, Mama’. We both cried very hard.”The Home Office rejection letters say that under immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living together in the UK. This would be waived if the parent living here had sole responsibility for the children, or the other partner had died.“This policy seems to operate under the guise of keeping families together, but it is splitting mine apart,” Murrey says.Ultimately the couple want the whole family to live together in Oxford, but Murrey says that right now they are just trying to “do what is best for our daughters”.She doesn’t know whether she has been singled out as a risk because her husband is from Cameroon. “We have family members and friends there who have been rejected for British visas in the past,” she says.The Wellcome Trust, a health research charity, has evidence of around 100 cases in which academics, especially from African countries, have been refused visas to come to the UK for conferences, often for spurious reasons.The African Studies Association UK found that at least 17 delegates were refused entry for its biennial academic conference at Birmingham University last year.Insa Nolte, a lecturer in African culture at Birmingham, is frustrated that academics can’t appeal against these decisions. “There is no process to identify immigration officers who consistently misjudge cases or who make racist assumptions,” she says.“If we are going to find solutions to global concerns like food security and climate change, we need to collaborate with academics across the world.”Meanwhile, young international academics who have gained their PhDs in Britain say some universities, fearful of the tougher visa rules, are automatically rejecting non-UK nationals for jobs for which they should be eligible.Dr Lisa Kayjani, an American who did her PhD in sociology at Edinburgh University, says: “In one case it was a job at another university I knew I could get a visa for. There was a pop-up as soon as I clicked the box saying I would need a visa. It said: ‘It is extremely unlikely that we would be able to sponsor you and we recommend that you abandon the application now’.” She applied anyway, but at 1am the next day received a rejection email. “It was clear that was an automated response, presumably because I was not a UK national.” Kayjani has given up applying to British universities. “Living with the hostile environment in the UK has worn me down so much that I don’t want to be an immigrant any more. The emotional tax is too great. I’m going home.”A young Canadian academic, who wished to remain anonymous, recently encountered a similar pop-up window when applying for a full-time lectureship that should have qualified her for a tier 2 visa at a London university.“It said: ‘It is highly unlikely that you would obtain permission to work in the UK on the basis of an offer for this … job. It is therefore recommended that you do not continue with your application’.”She says this felt like a sign saying: “foreigners go home”. She blames the government rather than universities, but says that after a year of applying for jobs she is beginning to feel desperate.Gareth Edwards, a senior geography lecturer at the University of East Anglia and co-founder of International and Broke, which campaigns against high visa costs for academics, says international academics are getting this sort of pop-up warning when applying for permanent lectureships. “Those jobs are most certainly eligible for sponsorship,” he says.Melany Cruz, a Chilean PhD student at Birmingham University, applied for an academic position elsewhere and also got an apparently automated rejection at 1am the next working day. “I’m sure not many HR people are working at 1am. I don’t think my application ever made it to the panel,” she says. “It is starting to feel impossible to find a job as an international PhD student, which is such a shame as I love what I do.”Paul Boustead, chair of the HR practitioners’ group Universities Human Resources, says universities want to recruit the most talented staff but some roles are simply “unlikely to obtain a work permit”.The Home Office says:“We welcome international academics from across the globe and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector. All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available, and in line with the immigration rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7fa8affe27ac98750d34d5b062076a5f38ba236/0_0_4182_2510/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9c705ede080d509d912af130bf538c","title":"pine martens released secret location forest of dean gloucestershire","story":"Reintroduction of species into Gloucestershire could prove setback for grey squirrels The shy and elusive pine marten, a woodland creature almost hunted to extinction in the UK, has been reintroduced to a forest in the English west country.Eighteen of the animals have been released at a secret and remote location in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.Conservationists hope the animals will breed, spread and eventually link up with a group of pine martens that was reintroduced across the border in Wales.It is possible the reintroduction will help manage the number of non-native grey squirrels in the forest and anywhere else the pine martens reach.Pine martens, which belong to the same family as otters and weasels, were once common in the UK. They are similar in size to a domestic cat with slim bodies, brown fur, a distinctive cream bib on their throats, long, bushy tails and prominent rounded ears.Extensive hunting, together with the loss of their woodland home, have led to them being pushed out to more remote parts of the UK. Their only remaining stronghold is in the Highlands of Scotland.There are believed to be about only 20 pine martens left in England. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 50 Scottish pine martens were captured and transported to Wales, where there is now an established population.In August and September this year, 18 pine martens were trapped near Inverness and taken to Gloucestershire. They were fitted with tracking collars and released into the Forest of Dean.Gareth Parry, the director of conservation at Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, said the pine martens’ activity will be closely monitored. He predicted a setback for the local grey squirrels, who tend to produce fewer young when there is a potential predator in the area. A reduction in the number of grey squirrels could help preserve ancient woodland, which they damage.The pine martens are likely to co-exist happily with the wild boar, a Forest of Dean inhabitant, which has made a comeback in the area.Parry added: “We are in a bioersity emergency and conserving our remaining wildlife is not enough. We must also take action to support nature’s recovery.”Catherine McNicol, the trust’s conservation project manager, said people were unlikely to see pine martens soon. “Pine martens are elusive and shy animals, with their presence often only indicated by scats in the middle of forestry tracks,” she said. “They only give birth to a few kits each year if breeding is even successful, so the rate of marten population recovery in the UK is low.”Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is working with several organisations on the project including Forestry England, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and Forest Research.Rebecca Wilson, Forestry England’s planning and environment manager in west England, said: “As native omnivores, pine martens play a vital role in the delicate balance of woodland ecosystems"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1cec70b8b410556c7017b58efd27457bc256cae/0_88_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b7f17d44db66bb018c74c75ed9ae0f","title":"three kings at 20 david o russell","story":"In David O Russell’s wild 1999 caper, action-packed comedy serves as a sneaky shell for a damning critique of American foreign policy“Are we shooting? Are we still shooting people or what?”That’s the opening line to David O Russell’s Three Kings and a thesis statement, too. It’s March 1991 and the Gulf war has just ended, but Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) doesn’t know whether the armed Iraqi soldier he’s spied in his scope is a target or not. And the yokels behind him are no help, either: one of them has a grain of sand stuck in his eye. After Barlow takes the shot, the first action any of them have seen in the war, he and his men hover over the twitching body in a scene that recalls the felled sniper at the end of Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket. In both instances, a piece of their humanity is lost, and in both instances not one of them could tell you why.From there, Russell cuts to a delirious montage of soldiers celebrating the victory like athletes who have just won a championship game. Probably only a few of them played in the game or understood the rules or even knew what winning meant, other than possibly ending a miserable, listless tour in the desert. Threading together a party mix that bounces, among other songs, from Lee Greenwood’s God Bless the USA to Public Enemy’s Can’t Do Nuttin’ for Ya Man – an incompatible set of artists if there ever was one – Russell may seem like he’s hijacking the delirious rock’n’roll surrealism of Apocalypse Now, but he’s establishing the wild disconnect between the American experience of the Gulf war and what the end of the war actually means for Iraqis. It turns out that “Woo! We liberated Kuwait!” doesn’t tell the story.It’s been 20 years since Three Kings, Russell’s confident foray into studio film-making after the indie comedies Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster, stormed into theaters. Since that time, there’s been a bigger, splashier sequel to the Gulf war and a war in Afghanistan, but the rationale for both isn’t much better than the urgent need to “liberate” a Middle Eastern country that most people couldn’t locate on a map. Both of those wars were premised on a terrorist threat, an answer to an attack that happened almost exactly two years after Three Kings came out, but some of young men and women eligible to enlist in 2019 were only infants on 911. Their rationale for being there indefinitely has become as obscure as the path to victory. No doubt some of them are out there now, seeing how night-vision goggles work during the day.Three Kings uncannily anticipated the mission drift, the refugee crises and the forever wars that have plagued the United States since it came out, but eight years after Operation Desert Storm ended, Russell just wanted audiences to know what the hell it was all about. Working from a story by John Ridley – a whole screenplay, really, which led to an ugly attribution dispute – Russell uses a thrilling update on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre to smuggle in a sophisticated treatment of the chaos and tragedy that filled the vacuum left by the US at the end of the war. Russell is pulling off two jobs at once here: just as his marauders use the postwar chaos to smuggle $23m in gold bullion (“No, not the little cubes you put in hot water to make soup”), his film uses an action-packed heist comedy to smuggle a damning assessment of American foreign policy.The fun begins with a treasure map tucked in the ass of a surrendering Iraqi officer. (“Do you think he ate it?” “No, it wouldn’t come out all perfect like that.”) It doesn’t take long for Troy and his dipstick buddy, Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze), to realize the significance of the find, and two higher-ranking soldiers, Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and press liaison Major Gates (George Clooney), are let in on the secret. Once they realize the map details a series of bunkers near Kerbala containing stolen Kuwaiti gold, Major Gates devises a plan for them to plunder the loot with a humvee and a commandeered truck, and secure their futures once they get back home.Gates’s logic is diabolically sound: the Americans will have no trouble sweeping in and taking the money since Saddam Hussein’s army is currently preoccupied with quashing the resistance. As he explains to his confused comrades, the rebels were encouraged by George Bush to rise up against Saddam, assuming they’d have American support, but when that support evaporated, they were targeted by the Iraqi Republican Guard. When the men witness a mother being executed in the streets of Kerbala, they decide to intervene by escorting a group of dissident refugees to safety across the Iran border, in the hope of salving their consciences while still padding their wallets.Once the Americans make the decision to help the refugees, Three Kings threatens to become a story about benevolent first-worlders saving the downtrodden, but Russell has a more sophisticated agenda. What unifies many of the characters in the film – the Americans, the dissidents and even members of the Republican Guard – is that they’re ordinary people at the mercy of the powerful and corrupt. At a minimum, they’re all risking their necks in a war zone, but the major Iraqi characters in the film have lost businesses and children, and had their lives permanently uprooted. In perhaps the best scene in the film, an Iraqi captain (Saïd Taghmaoui) tortures Troy with electric shocks while explaining that American bombs cost him a baby daughter, just like the one Troy awaits to meet when he gets home. “We’re both fathers,” says Troy sympathetically, to which his interrogator replies, “I’m not a father no more, dude, remember?”Three Kings is a thrilling work of sensory overload, charged up by killer music cues, alternating scenes of screwball comedy and crushing pathos, and the surreal bits of business that tend to emerge from the fog of war. Skeet-shooting nerf footballs from the back of a humvee, a cow exploded by a landmine, footage of the Rodney King beating piped into purloined Kuwaiti TV sets – nothing seems out of place. In a war this senseless, Russell implies, anything is possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b60af37234e72c24046a193b391b521030f483f/52_166_4260_2555/master/4260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b41746ac0b32d5a567d047dce08eea39","title":"bayern munich sights return to heights tottenham champions league","story":"The German giants are still delivering on the field despite boardroom upheaval and a summer of unwelcome headlinesThe past few months at Sabener Strasse have resembled Coronation Street, with the goings-on at Bayern Munich reminiscent of a half‑baked and barely believable soap-opera storyline. It is, if nothing else, in keeping with the nature of the club’s FC Hollywood moniker. From the sublime – look no further than Philippe Coutinho’s sumptuous assist for Serge Gnabry on Saturday – to the ridiculous, namely the president, Uli Hoeness, recently backtracking over threatening to prevent players joining up with the national side should Manuel Neuer be dropped in favour of Marc-André ter Stegen. Never dull, it has been difficult for Bayern to mute the volume on a series of sagas.There was the very public summer pursuit of Leroy Sané, with Bayern expected to make another play for the Manchester City winger in January, and a failed effort to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. The man behind the moves is the sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, who is out of contract next summer and at pains to convince despite pulling rabbits out of the hat with the last-minute loan signings of Coutinho and Ivan Perisic.In addition there is a changing of the guard at the top. Hoeness and the chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, have announced they will depart, though neither will truly surrender power any time soon Hoeness will step down in November but remain on the club’s supervisory board until at least 2023 while the former Bayern captain Oliver Kahn will assume Rummenigge’s role on the first day of 2022. Caught in the middle of the impasse and infighting is the manager Niko Kovac, walking a tightrope to keep both satisfied Rummenigge has aired his doubts and ticked off Kovac after the Croat said he was confident Sané would join the club.It seems absurd that the ground is so rocky at Bayern before they face Tottenham on Tuesday, given they are top of the Bundesliga – in which they have not lost since February – after winning a domestic double. But this is Bayern, a team who do not know any different. They are a club obsessed with success, an empire with their eyes fixed on something significantly more substantial than pipping Borussia Dortmund to the next title. Domestic success is a given by Bayern’s standards and an insipid Champions League exit to Liverpool in March – the last time they were defeated in Bavaria – rankled from top to bottom.This season they will again be expected to go deep into the competition. Bayern yearn to restore their status as a European superpower, to be elevated to the heights that Jupp Heynckes lifted them when they won the Champions League, the final of which Bayern will host in 2022, in a treble-winning season six years ago.The one constant since July 2014 has been the prolific Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 12 goals in 11 matches this season. Ten of those came in the Bundesliga, meaning he has personally outscored 10 of the 18 teams in the ision. Since joining Bayern from Dortmund the Pole has scored 138 league goals in 165 games. Before the arrivals of Coutinho and Perisic, which earned Salihamidzic much-needed brownie points, the 31-year-old openly questioned the club’s transfer activity. “We need players who can make an immediate difference from the bench,” Lewandowski said after defeat by Dortmund in the German Supercup during August. He signed a new four-year contract 26 days later. “Yes, I stated my opinion,” he said. “I can win games on my own but only teams win titles.”Everything may not be rosy – it hardly ever is at Bayern – but there is plenty for Spurs to fear. Perisic and Lucas Hernández are fit enough to be part of Kovac’s travelling squad while Gnabry and Kingsley Coman continue to flourish where Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry for so long excelled. The 18-year-old Alphonso Davies, who was born in a refugee camp in Ghana after his parents fled the second Liberian civil war, has provided further verve.Coutinho has been starting at the expense of a fans’ favourite, Thomas Müller, who has been relegated to the bench. “He has dealt with the situation really well,” Salihamidzic said. “He is total professional.” Yet the element of struggle in a 3-2 victory over the ision’s bottom club last weekend is symptomatic of the uphill task facing Kovac, hampered by unhelpful headlines since taking the job last year.As Kicker pointed out, Bayern were made to worry. “That was not the manner of victory we wanted,” Salihamidzic said of a wasteful display. “In footballing terms we can play much better, clearly. We want to, we will and we must increase the level of performance. If in London we are presented with two big chances, then we must be more effective.”The challenge now, as Der Spiegel highlighted, is for Coutinho to weave his magic in a Bayern shirt against not only a team playing in the Bundesliga 2 last season but also last season’s Champions League finalists. Mats Hummels and Rafinha, players Kovac failed to convince, departed this summer but when Hoeness eventually follows there is an expectation that the manager will be exposed to greater scrutiny by Rummenigge. Hoeness has suggested a little friction fosters success but any fallout could get messy. Kovac knows, as Mauricio Pochettino can vouch, he is never too far from apparent crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ebb04cbd71016f04fd018259023eb599de88018/222_61_2145_1287/master/2145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580477c0c10f388c8e6345ed7b1dacde","title":"manchester united arsenal premier league","story":"A nice goal and VAR controversy could not disguise the truth that Manchester United and Arsenal are far from their peakAre you not entertained? Actually. Now you mention it: not so much. On a rain-sodden night at Old Trafford the Premier League dished up the usual ration of bread and circuses.An oddly laborious game of football between two transitional teams was bookended by a pair of goal-related incidents that will take the headlines, but which will also disguise the wider story here of a game between the third and ninth richest clubs in the world that seemed to exist at times behind a glaze of entropy.A 1-1 draw was a fair result in every sense. Fair because neither team deserved to lose and fair also because neither really deserved to win. Within this matrix the game’s one real moment of high-quality incision was marked by a second-half incident. And yes, it was VAR once again, but also not VAR, which did its job perfectly in awarding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s equalising goal.For this particular muddle, blame the humans instead – always blame the humans – and a system that really does need to work out its creases. It was a lovely piece of play. Aubameyang took Bukayo Saka’s neat slid pass and glided in on goal before dinking the ball past David de Gea with insolent ease. Except, something was wrong here. There was a glitch in the moment. The away end caught its breath. De Gea did not e, raised an arm, acknowledging the assistant Scott Ledger’s offside flag.Two mistakes in one moment of fudge. Aubameyang was miles onside, as the VAR check would rule. The second mistake belonged to De Gea, who really should have twigged by now that you keep playing these days until someone forcibly stops you. Nothing is certain. Nothing is true. Do not believe the evidence of your eyes, or the actions of the previously infallible man in black. Every call is provisional. Play to the delayed long-distance verdict.There is a third mistake here, a structural one. In the Champions League referees assistants have been told not to flag, to wait for those close calls to resolve themselves. Ledger intervened and found himself a player in the game, the 12th man dummying United’s keeper, luring him into a mistake of his own. This really does need to be tidied up. The man with the flag is now an active hazard. In the post-digital world, like so many things of value, he may even be obsolete.So much for Moment Two. Moment One had come two minutes before half-time as Scott McTominay scored United’s opener. Even the home fans seemed to pause as the ball hit the net. The roar when it came was tinged with a sense of incredulity, like a man sneezing himself awake from a post-lunch doze. Partly this was because it was a lovely goal, a brilliantly precise shot that flew flat and hard into the corner. And partly it was just because it was a shot.And this was the real story of this game. Not VAR or even Granit Xhaka’s head-dip as McTominay’s shot flew though the space where his head had been, a moment that will no doubt have the George Graham-era back four besieged for their opinion on the new Arsenal captain’s heart, guts, spleen, kidneys and other vital organs. “Back in the day George would string a rope around our necks and force us to stand still while Don Howe fired air gun pellets at our foreheads” – that kind of thing.The real story, though, was something else. There were bright points in this game. Saka looked agreeably fearless, a lovely mover, playing always with his head up. Daniel James was exhilarating at times.Beyond that what stood out was the basic poverty of these two teams. Old Trafford had been a thrilling, boisterous place at kick-off. The old music is still there at times like these, even the sheets of Manchester rain through the lights adding a sheen of event-glamour. But peel back the layers, the glam, the staging, and this was a lukewarm rice pudding of a game, the buzz seeming to die with the first few misplaced passes, that blur of indeterminate movement.It took Lucas Torreira 16 minutes to make his first pass. Ten minutes later Andreas Pereira set off on a lovely driving run followed by the game’s first shot with 27 minutes gone. It looked so natural and easy one wondered why more people did not try it. The second did catch fire in the end, although always with a sense of vagueness to the attacking combinations.But then, watching these two restage that storied Premier League rivalry here felt a bit like watching Benn v Eubank, or like a tribute night off the main Vegas strip, two grizzled old A-listers, bow ties undone, still crooning out the same old standards.So far this season Arsenal have had a pedigree attack and a defence that seems at times to be a kind of satirical art installation. Here they were more solid but stodgy in midfield. United still have a sense of entropy about them, a team built expensively, pointlessly, to no obvious plan. For all the surrounding noise, there was no real evidence of anything more here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fbee07be2f1308b6a7118e56e78f825879f9a7/802_640_3620_2173/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be753d4324952fef3a32bad25f19cfc","title":"minecraft earth launch games microsoft augmented reality","story":"As the augmented-reality spinoff from the block-building game arrives this month, players will be taking their creations to the streetsSix of us are huddled together in Cavendish Square Gardens in central London, fighting a horde of warrior skeletons. To passersby, however, we must look like a bunch of adults pointing our smartphones at nothing while shouting about incoming monsters. This isn’t a bizarre new workplace therapy. What we’re doing is playing a beta version of Minecraft Earth, an augmented reality (AR) spinoff from the multimillion-selling block-building game – and very soon, parks all over the world will be filled with people just like us.This month, Minecraft is launching an early-access version of the game in a select few territories around the world, ahead of a global roll-out. Microsoft has yet to reveal exactly when and where, but soon thousands of fans used to playing on their console, PC or tablet, are going to be taking their creations to the streets.Built by a team at Microsoft’s Redmond campus, Minecraft Earth lets you construct models that can be viewed in real-world settings via your phone camera. You’ll be able to build a castle on your kitchen table, save it to memory, then view a lifesize version wherever you go – as long as there’s enough space for a virtual building made from 1m blocks, which can be up to 64 blocks high. The game also places collectible Minecraft blocks and objects – known as tappables – around your own neighbourhood, so while out walking, you can look at the map screen, see that there’s a treasure chest nearby, then tap on it to open it up and discover new resources to build with – perhaps a few planks of wood, some stone or a window.Like the gigantically successful Pokémon Go, however, there are also specific story events, tied to various locations, that players can discover and interact with. When Microsoft showed the game to a group of journalists in Cavendish Square Gardens, one of these Adventure tasks was marked on the Minecraft Earth maps on our phones – the moment we tapped on it, a lifesize stone building sprang up among the trees, and immediately skeleton soldiers began pouring out for us to attack with our swords and bows and arrows. When you defeat the onslaught, you get to scoop up all the treasure they leave behind. Although both the building and the skeletons are visible only as graphical objects on our phone screens, it’s weird how quickly and completely you get sucked in, forgetting that the joggers doing laps of the square can’t see the epic struggle taking place.The idea for Minecraft Earth came from an intriguing real-world project. In 2012, Mojang, the studio behind the Minecraft game, set up a charity named Block By Block, which allowed young people in developing countries to design new areas for their communities using the game. Working with the United Nations human settlements programme, these models and ideas could then be voted on and put into action, revitalising neglected or dangerous urban spaces.“We thought, what if everyone could try this?” says game director Torfi Olafsson. “We found out there was research going on in the Microsoft cognition group, which works on the Hololens unit, which would allow us to place things with precision in physical space – that’s the technology Adventures use.”Minecraft Earth employs Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing infrastructure to host and maintain the world, and Azure spatial anchors to place the persistent Adventure tasks in real-world locations. Each of these adventures is hosted on a single dedicated instance on the server, so everyone who sees an Adventure in a certain place can join in with other players and defeat enemies together. At the moment, the number of players able to join an instance is hard coded to a maximum of 40. “But it’s flexible,” says Olafsson. “It’s not a technical issue. It’s more about comfort and personal space.”The game also employs the collaborative mapping software OpenStreetMap to place tappables in the world, using a proprietary algorithm that selects suitable areas based on safety and space concerns. “Our algorithms will never choose an area that doesn’t grant enough space for you to manoeuvre within and around the adventure, and we’ll also allow players to feedback if they don’t think an adventure is well-placed,” says Olafsson. “OpenStreetMap is a fantastic resource, an incredibly detailed map of the entire world complete with tagging. You can see if a particular space is a cemetery, a public park or even a military installation.”Because the tags are generated by users, however, interesting errors can sometimes arise. “We had an issue with placing tappables in a particular neighbourhood of London,” says Olafsson. “We discovered that someone had tagged an upcoming extension of the underground as an overground train so our algorithm believed that there was a massive train line running through the area and excluded that neighbourhood completely.”He also says that some of the OpenStreetMap tags highlight locations that are unsafe – or just unsavoury. “It’ll give you information about areas that are not so nice, like really shady clubs. We use these tags to generate a blacklist of where not to place items, but it’s often very interesting – especially if you were building a sort of augmented reality Grand Theft Auto game!”Minecraft Earth has been in a prototyping phase for 18 months, and, over the last few weeks, a limited closed beta has taken place in key cities around the world – which has revealed some interesting issues. Players in Japan, for example, started to ride bullet trains so they could hoover up tappable objects much more quickly than just walking around their cities. “They were progressing too fast and it broke the system,” laughs Olafsson. “We had to install a speed limit on collecting in-game items.”The game was pirated during the beta and quickly distributed on Android devices. “Overnight we were seeing people in South Africa, in small villages in Siberia, all across Asia, a huge player base in South America,” says Olafsson. “It was shocking to wake up in the morning, look at the data and see that the game had accidentally gone global. We can’t condone piracy, but it definitely validated our use of OpenStreetMap data to generate content. A random person in Papua New Guinea was able to take their phone out and collect tappables because the algorithm had made content.”When the game enters open early access later this month, anyone in the supported territories (which Microsoft has not yet confirmed) will be able to download and play it while the team continues to iterate and improve the code. At the start, it’ll be possible to build and share only quite simple structures, although from the outset, you’ll be able to invite nearby players to collaborate on your projects. Later, Microsoft plans to define special areas in open public spaces where users will be able to showcase particularly impressive builds. Soon, perhaps, every park will have its own AR sculpture gallery.Considering the huge success of the Minecraft brand, which just reached 176 million players, as well as the continuing popularity of Pokémon Go, and the fascinated looks we drew from other people in Cavendish Square Gardens, Minecraft Earth is going to be extremely popular. It will be interesting to see how stable the experience is with hundreds of thousands of people playing, and whether the development team is able to evolve the game overtime to keep people involved. We have also yet to see exactly how Microsoft will monetise the game. It’s free to play, and to collect items, but there will be in-app purchases, perhaps providing quicker access to desirable rare blocks through payment options. Whatever the case, as a marker for the future of AR as a gaming platform, Minecraft Earth has fascinating ramifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3d1a6aff9f49935ab8ee714a9ef8087257b9da/648_127_2253_1352/master/2253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a87ed93c0e19164dc562dd5cf322a5d","title":"geena davis damaging stereotypes on screen limit womens aspirations","story":"Actor speaks out as film industry study on characters in leadership roles finds women four times more likely than men to be shown nakedThe promises of positive change for women on screen that followed her role in the groundbreaking film Thelma and Louise have failed to materialise, leaving girls today with few role models, according to the actor Geena Davis.The media continue to have a huge influence on how the world views women and girls, and how they view themselves, she said. But few current roles show women in powerful positions, and continue to reinforce damaging gender stereotypes.“We know from many examples that media images can be incredibly powerful in a positive way if you bother to do that,” Davis told the . “My theory is we don’t have enough real-life role models of women in important positions and occupations to inspire change, and so we need to have them in fiction so that life will imitate art.“I believed all the press reaction about Thelma and Louise, that it was going to change everything and that there were now going to be far more female lead characters in movies, and I was thrilled.“And actually the next move I made, A League of Their Own, the press announced the same thing, that now absolutely for sure everything is going to change. There’ll be so many sports movies now. And none of those things happened.“It’s incredibly disappointing how little progress has been made.”Research published on Tuesday analysed the film industry’s portrayal of women and its impact on the lives of girls, carried out by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which the actor founded in 2004, and the NGO Plan International.It analysed the 56 top-grossing films of 2018 in 20 countries in North America, Scandinavia, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe.Of the characters in leadership positions, it found that women and girls were four times more likely than men to be shown wearing revealing clothing nearly twice as likely to be shown as partially nude and four times more likely to be shown completely naked. It also found that when a slow motion focus was used on lead characters’ bodies, nearly twice as many female leads were sexually objectified than men.Research also revealed that twice as many men appeared in the 56 films and they spoke twice as much as women. Male characters were shown as being more effective and more respected when in leadership positions, while female presidents and prime ministers were portrayed as struggling with the job. Where female characters were portrayed as strong, it was in the home.Almost half of the characters across the films analysed, which collectively earned $21bn (£17bn) at the box office, were white. Only one of the 60 female leaders in the films was LGBTQ+. None of the films was directed by a woman, only a quarter had at least one female producer and one in 10 had at least one woman on the writing team.In the report, Rewrite her Story, 10,000 girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 25, in 19 countries, were polled about the role media played in shaping their aspirations and view of themselves.“Of course it hurts me because … even if I know I could be a leader, I won’t do it because I see it is just for men, not for women,” a 22-year-old Ugandan woman told researchers. “So that affects me. I’ll have to sit back and watch men doing it, even though I am capable of doing it too.”Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International, said while “a woman 007 or superhero in film is welcome … our research shows they are exceptions and not the rule”.“The bigger picture is that gender discrimination and harmful stereotypes still dominate on screen. This undermines girls and young women and has a negative impact on their aspirations to leadership in all walks of life.”Davis said she remained optimistic that things would improve. The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have had a “remarkable” impact on the industry. “We can feel change in the air,” she said.“I feel the easiest way to bring change in our culture is on-screen representation. And if you make it happen there, it will happen in real life.”She added: “Imagine if I had stayed on air for eight years, what would be happening now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bac4add8c6fe4b3f8198b9c4616d46443532ead/0_303_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d75d8be4e8c2ea0cbad39fe6310981","title":"cinema and the art of interior design","story":"Directors such as Pedro Almodovar understand the psychological power of living spacesTwo almost-autobiographical films came out in late summer, one set in a Knightsbridge flat decorated in shades of porridge, and the other in an apartment in Madrid filled with brilliantly coloured design icons and flamboyant figurative artworks. The first demonstrated few aesthetic choices beyond a wall of mirror tiles the second maybe too many. Still, you can probably guess which one I preferred.This mismatching movie pair is The Souvenir by Joanna Hogg and Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory. The first details the early film-making years of its director, and a relationship with a manipulative heroin addict. The second, set in the unable-to-make-films years of Almodóvar’s life, loops together multiple strands of his existence, including a replacement of prescription painkillers with street heroin that may or may not be true. (Who cares? It’s such an acute comment on pain relief in these Sackler times).Hogg’s unformed Knightsbridge interior is the perfect, dull backdrop for her own inchoate, twentysomething state, a physical version of a life utterly free from conspicuous displays of just about anything. A visit to her parents’ country home – a rather fine slab of Georgian – reveals an equally undemonstrative existence played out across more acres of cream fitted carpeting.The highly constructed condition of Almodóvar’s world, on the other hand – the Fornasetti cabinet with butterflies fluttering across its doors the Enzo Mari Pear poster the shiny red Magistretti lamp – is a drama in itself. Its exquisite scenography suggests there is little or no ide between the director’s personal and professional worlds. In fact, some of the pieces of furniture and objets reoccur. In 2009’s Broken Romance the camera lingers on a red Enzo Mari Apple print, when Penelope Cruz, as the bored lover of a film producer, gets sent off to redecorate his already lavishly decorated mansion. We travel through magnificent rooms, filled with Saarinen tables and Bertoia wire chairs, as well as lush paintings. I don’t doubt that some are by Guillermo Pérez Villalta. Everywhere red leaps from the screen, in a film ostensibly about a man who has lost his sight, who now lives in a world where objects are defined by their feel, not their look.Interior design in films is an integral part of the narrative when it’s good, it creates an additional psychological layer. Indications of taste and status are all very well, but it can do so much more. I mean, who wouldn’t expect Patrick Bateman’s apartment to resemble anything other than an office lobby-cum-operating theatre as it does in the adaptation of American Psycho? Every element of the film struggled to convey the novel’s relentless sociopathy and superficial materialism without it appearing listlessly list-like, and perhaps not everyone quite got the serial killer message. This year GQ Middle East ran a “get the look” feature on this very interior, with a slender proviso of “without the creepiness” and a full guide on where to get the Barcelona chairs and B+B Italia Alanda coffee table. (They should check in with MotherFatherSon next – the TV serial drama starring Richard Gere – where the media mogul’s son lives in chilly minimal splendour at the top of the Leadenhall building. Though surely even they know that no good comes to those who live with stainless steel floors.)Recently I’ve been watching FosseVerdon, about the entwined lives of the choreographer-director and performer-choreographer in 1960s and 1970s New York. Their shared apartment, a penthouse in Manhattan at 91 Central Park West, with a terrace large enough for a vegetable garden and a dog run, was slavishly recreated by the designer Alex DiGerlando from old photographs. This was a world of Tiffany lamps and thick-pile upholstery, ashtrays on stands and dark greens and aubergines: like their lives, seductive more than healthy. The kitchen, a small room for such a huge property, had a chequer-board tiled floor. “I’d never have thought of putting crushed orange velvet on the walls,” he said in an interview.No imagery existed of the Southampton beach house that Fosse took on in the summer of 1973 – a statement of change and an outward show of success, along with a much younger lover, following his spell in a psychiatric hospital. The team designed it from imagination – its concertina’d glazed facade suggesting a thoroughly contemporary footloose life that even New York couldn’t provide. Friends of Fosse have since said this fictional space is just as they remembered it, perhaps unsurprising as they were rarely one step from another sip of wine. And if you want to get this look, those Marcel Breuer Cesca chairs around the dining table are very much for real."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/317_133_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0fa67de279d55c13869e4722e5e1e3","title":"naga munchetty bbc reverses decision to censure presenter","story":"Director general Tony Hall emails staff to say he is overturning ruling over impartiality guidelinesThe BBC has reversed its decision to sanction BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines with her comments about Donald Trump, following a staff uprising against the ruling and enormous political pressure.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, emailed all staff on Monday to say he had reviewed the decision following internal and external protests. He said that, on reflection, the BBC’s complaints unit had made the wrong call when they ruled against Munchetty, one of the BBC’s most prominent minority ethnic journalists, for expressing a personal response to the US president’s statement in July that four American congresswomen of colour should “go home”.Asked about Trump’s comments on BBC Breakfast, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.”The U-turn over censuring her came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence casting doubts on public claims about the complaints process made by a senior BBC executive, as he attempted to explain why Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker had escaped punishment, despite taking part in the same discussion.The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention the male presenter. “The simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role,” he said in one interview. “The complaint was about Naga Munchetty.”However, copies of the viewer’s complaint leaked to the  show that the original correspondence was explicitly about both Munchetty and Walker, leading to internal anger from BBC employees who demanded that women and minority ethnic journalists should be treated fairly by the corporation.The original complaint from a member of the public was titled “Blatant political bias from both presenters” and described Walker as “very unprofessional”, with the member of the public making clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments.The original complaint said: “Dan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump’s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump’s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally ‘furious’ about his comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It’s about time they were reminded of this.”The BBC insisted Jordan had not lied in the interviews when he said that Walker was not mentioned. They said Jordan was only referring to a revised version of the complaint, submitted by the same member of the public, which had been elevated to the corporation’s executive complaints unit. The BBC said this final version of the viewer complaint was solely about Munchetty, meaning it could not investigate Walker for his role in the discussion.On Monday night, BBC employees said the issue had reignited wider concerns about on-screen ersity at the corporation and how the BBC treated prominent senior white, male journalists differently to staff from a minority ethnic background.“People don’t care if it’s a conspiracy or not it just exposes the hypocrisy at the BBC,” said one senior journalist. “It’s come out by chance but it’s symptomatic of the arrogance of how BBC management treats women and people of colour. What’s really important is that Naga has said nothing and done nothing to encourage this, people have reacted spontaneously. This has got so big because journalists have just got together on their own and complained.”BBC journalists described growing concerns about the broadcaster’s role in an ongoing culture war which uses the BBC’s news coverage as a battleground for settling political scores, with particular concerns about a sometimes opaque complaints process that can be influenced by a single persistent member of the public.The U-turn followed several days in which the BBC management staunchly defended the original decision, insisting that although Munchetty was allowed to call Trump’s comments racist and offer a verdict on how they made her feel as a woman of colour, she could not cast aspersions on his character.The BBC had originally attempted to defend the decision, with Jordan saying it was not its role to be “calling out people for being liars or racist”.However, the corporation had come under intense political pressure to change direction, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for it to be reconsidered and Labour MP Seema Malhotra organising a letter to Hall, signed by 100 MPs, calling for a meeting to discuss the decision.Hall’s email to BBC staff explained why he had changed direction: “I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself,” he said. “It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgments.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”However, Hall fell short of apologising to Munchetty and did not address the issue of Jordan’s comments or why Walker had not be investigated for taking part in the discussion. On Friday, the BBC’s entire team of executives – including Hall - signed a public letter which backed the original decision, a position that has now been abandoned.The decision also raises major questions about the BBC’s ability to enforce its impartiality guidelines in the future, given the director general has now shown himself willing to intervene and overturn ruling by the semi-independent complaints unit in face of public pressure. The corporation’s management has been struggling to stop its journalists speaking out in a personal capacity on issues such as the Munchetty ruling and LGBT rights, with staff increasingly willing to ignore warnings from bosses to stay quiet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37014723d09e8ab06b0b6f5557a7f5cc99dec311/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=268de5bb972cca635f7c8a827fe2a75a","title":"50 great tracks october alicia keys dababy angel olsen","story":"An epic harp workout and an unearthed Japanese ambient gem sit alongside new rap from DaBaby and James Massiah in our playlist of the month’s best new music – read about our 10 favourites belowby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesThe video for this track is dubbed a “visual sonic installation” and stars the song’s duetting singers, plus Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego Saldana, and Michael B Jordan, all doing balletic things with water, paint and each other. It’s beautiful and rather grand, unlike the song, which is beautiful but much more understated. Over gently swaying acoustic guitar, Alicia and Miguel coo sweet nothings to each other in a gorgeous, timeless melody, the kind of thing that sounds improvised by Keys just sitting at the piano and playing. This relaxed, unforced mood hopefully suffuses her incoming seventh album. BBTIt’s hard to think of another contemporary singer who time-travels as convincingly as Angel Olsen. Her debut sounded as though it had been recorded by lamplight in a poorly insulated shack later records reinvigorated classic rock’n’roll and weepies worthy of Roy Orbison. On Lark, she harnesses high romanticism, the lux drama of classic Hollywood. It’s a hard sound to land without veering into pastiche, let alone to hold one’s own amid the heavy arrangements. But Olsen commands the scene. She teases out the details of a relationship that crumbled into the void of disconnection, the soft production accruing a potent charge. Then the tension snaps: “What about my dreams?” she howls, addressing a former lover who failed to see her for who she truly was. As the strings go off like a fireworks display comprised entirely of screamer rockets, the blinkered sod is left in no uncertain terms about the magnitude of her desires. LSThe rap breakthrough of the year award has to go to DaBaby, who has just released Kirk, his second album of 2019 following the excellent Baby on Baby. The first album was mostly fixated on guns, wealth and – as track titles such as Carpet Burn and Baby Sitter allude – shagging. But Intro announces that Kirk is rather more soul-searching. With his HD alpha-male delivery, DaBaby tells of his pre-fame poverty, and the pain of his father dying at the same time that he finally became successful. It prompts a reflection on the enduring power of family and friendship even through the complicating factors of newfound fame and wealth. BBTThis LA post-hardcore five-piece aren’t so much in touch with their feelings as sending them a constant stream of extremely earnest WhatsApps. A decade into their career, they follow their recently rerecorded debut with this first track from their forthcoming new album, and the lyrics from frontman Jeremy Bolm are almost self-parodic in their emo-ness: “A last responder to my own self interest … Cold-shouldered by design,” he laments. “I’m a secondhand piano  Incapable of tune  Providing the score  For gone too soon.” But boy, does he sell them – the chorus would be anthemic sung by anyone, but is made gloriously so by Bolm’s acute feeling. BBTIt’s tough to pick a standout from Brittany Howard’s remarkable debut solo album, Jaime. But even on this intimate, exposing record, Goat Head cuts deeper than everything else. It’s a break from the album’s diffuse blues, hooked instead around a lilting piano loop. Howard layers it as she assembles her child’s-eye understanding of colour: first learning red from green, the way your parents teach you. Then, starker differences: having a white mother and a black father in a southern town, and how that prompted a hate crime slashed tyres, a goat’s head on the back seat. The stumbling joins in the looped piano become fissures as the younger Howard becomes painfully cognisant of the world’s gaping inconsistencies more unsettling is how Howard and her backing vocalists turn “goat head in the back” into a sensual, soothing refrain. LSLeft over from the recording of her 2018 album Hundreds of Days, Quintana finds harpist Mary Lattimore at her most expansive and melancholy. Her glassy playing is subsumed by static fog, which, across 15 eventful minutes, swells and eddies, blurring the precision of her playing and building to an unexpected bass note that hits like a cataclysmic omen. The track also calls to mind the imposing tundras of Canadian drone composer Tim Hecker’s defining Ravedeath, 1972. Given that it’s an outtake from an album with which it has little in common, it’s hard to tell whether it indicates a new creative horizon or an abandoned idea for Lattimore. Either way, its bittersweet beauty and lingering sense of doom feels arrestingly contemporary for this moment in the climate crisis. LSAlthough he was recently and no doubt mendaciously mistaken for Beto O’Rourke by right-wing trolls, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign – he’s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter – and Frank Ocean’s sometime guitarist – one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. BBTTexas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that’s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It’s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer’s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she’ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: “Je plante mes crocs dans ta chair,” she coos – I’ll sink my fangs into your flesh – taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade. LSSet in an equatorial city, the gripping video for south London poetrapper James Massiah’s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat – so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. LSJapanese ambient is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kankyō Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label.

But could things have been different?Ten years ago, Kanye West stormed the stage during the then 19-year-old Taylor Swift’s MTV VMAs acceptance speech and dropped the now-iconic “Imma let you finish” interruption: this you already know. But in the decade since, the two stars’ paths have drastically erged: Swift into anthem-heavy pop megastardom, Kanye into footwear and God. If we treat that moment as a sort of ground zero for both their ensuing careers, could we not imagine a series of different outcomes and consequences stemming from this moment, and write them out in fun and snappy and word count-adherent hypotheticals? Well, strangely, yes. Here’s what might’ve happened.The year 2009 was towards the end of The Neg-era – that Game-inspired putdown-cum-flirting tactic – and if you think about it, the most neg Neg possible is getting on stage exactly when someone’s being awarded for being good at something and telling them that actually they’re rubbish and deserve nothing. This is how we get an alt-timeline where: Kanye and Taylor become an amalgamated couple post-VMAs, Kimye never happens and Swift’s Red album never exists, because all the Vogue shoots and pre-2012 heartbreak never happened because she’s been holed up in an LA mansion for nigh-on 10 years with her lover, West. Kanye still does his blog. Taylor’s shaved her head. Shutter sunglasses are still in vogue. It’s a terrible place to live.Fair to say Kanye’s interruption in 2009 was “very cognac-inspired” and, in a just and right world, his mates (does Kanye have mates? Someone check please) (Just thinking about how exhausting it would be to be Kanye’s mate. Have decided since the last brackets: Kanye doesn’t have mates) would sit him down in a quiet room and tell him: “Kanye, though aesthetically this is your greatest ever era, and last year’s 808s is your most underrated album, you probably need to not get up on stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech and start yelling about Beyoncé come on buddy, let’s get you to some nice cosy talking therapy.” Ultimately, the only thing different about a timeline where Kanye West addresses his demons in 2009 rather than post-Kim is we do not have the album Ye, and I think we can all agree that’s no great net loss.If there’s one thing Taylor Swift is known for, it’s for being an almost painfully wholesome presence in the pop world, sort of like if a BuzzFeed five-ingredient brownie recipe came to life and started doing stadium tour choreography. In the 10 years since The Kanye Incident, she has behaved with nothing but distant grace and beef-free decorum in relation to it and the ensuing remembrances (see: Kim Kardashian beef, circa 2016). But what if that’s all Kanye’s doing? Think about it: is it not possible that, 10 years ago, Kanye West handed Taylor, on stage, a sort of bulletproof moral high ground, and it’s been the handbrake on any bad behaviour ever since. She cannot possibly rebel because if she does that she will “Kanye” herself, and therefore lose. As Taylor (now) approaches the age of Kanye (then), she is nowhere near getting ungraciously drunk on Hennessy and interrupting someone else’s awards speech. Without a Kanye-shaped villain for Taylor to be the golden light in contrast to, alt-universe Taylor is currently in her OxyContin phase and flirting with a face tattoo, simply because there’s no one to prove wrong by not doing it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f6bd3340dff3c4350e0cfd48c90cd8f76b5638f/0_130_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3edaf42592fbdc3d145b92554c825042","title":"jessye norman life in pictures","story":"Singing with Jon Bon Jovi, performing La Marseillaise in Paris, receiving a medal from Obama … we remember the many sides of the great American opera singer, who has died aged 74"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64dd571c3f328731f92c7ab96a6bd50aa80177f6/0_0_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a974970140b8c194c5d8aff7cd26563c","title":"is it over for justin trudeau podcast","story":"The Canadian prime minister achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future less certain.

That is an absolute commitment.”A government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the “non-paper”, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The \u0027backstop\u0027 in Theresa May\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a \u0027trap\u0027 to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.\u0026nbspInteractive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderIn the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested.But Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a “non-starter”, and called for a “serious proposal” from the UK.Sinn Féin in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said they were “absolutely out of the question”, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “It doesn’t matter if it’s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.”Labour said the proposals were “utterly unworkable”. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “They would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.“Crucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.”The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.Although all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party’s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson’s team are due to enter a “tunnel” of secret negotiations with Brussels.Mark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.During a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the “Spartan” wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.“It has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That’s not true,” he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times.“If there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I’ll look at a deal if there is one,” he said.Francois’ comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.The British government’s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspand the Republic of Ireland. The “backstop” is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU.Theresa May\u0027s withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU’s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements.Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament.If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop.As recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May’s deal completely.Johnson has publicly said May’s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, due to go to the EU next week, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop.“My acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?” Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group.He said his support for a deal “rather depends what’s in it … As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don’t, then I will vote against it and if we don’t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.”His remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as “advocating” one.She told the Bruges Group: “It would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop” but added that it would be “good to get a deal”.She called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad259e6a196200ba53b5cae89c9938cbfcad1a8c/0_99_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b8a9dcda95ede189e757d1b26d9ba0","title":"westminster parties sign pledge to use moderate language","story":"Statement signed by main parties follows furious scenes in recent debatesSenior figures from the main Westminster parties have signed a pledge outlining their “responsibility to try to use moderate language” following furious scenes in the Commons in recent debates about Brexit.The statement, drawn up during a meeting at the Speaker’s House in parliament on Monday, was signed by Mark Spencer, the government chief whip – most government ministers are in Manchester for the Conservative conference – and Jeremy Corbyn.The other signatories were the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson the Democratic Unionist party’s Nigel Dodds the Green MP Caroline Lucas the Independent Group for Change leader, Anna Soubry Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts and the Speaker, John Bercow.“We all accept that we have a responsibility to try to use moderate language,” the statement begin. “We all feel that those in leadership positions have a particular duty to weigh their words carefully, bearing in mind that there are stark isions across the country on Brexit.“The right of a member to personal safety is absolute and unconditional. Everyone is entitled to have a view – be they parliamentarian, journalist or a member of the public – and their right to safety cannot in any way be dependent on what that view is or the course of political action they take.”The gathering was instigated following anger and upset in the Commons last week, when there was repeated criticism of Boris Johnson for terms such as “surrender bill” to describe a backbench-instigated law seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The most vehement anger came on Wednesday last week, when Johnson described as “humbug” worries expressed by Labour’s Paula Sherriff about threats to MPs by people using the same language as the prime minister, and her fears of a repeat of the 2016 murder of fellow Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist.Johnson was also condemned for arguing in the same debate that the best way to honour Cox – who campaigned vigorously for remain – would be to “get Brexit done”.The prime minister repeatedly refused to apologise, saying only that his use of “humbug” referred to people arguing against the use of the term surrender, and that he was “sorry for the misunderstanding”.Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he had requested the gathering following Johnson’s comments “and the appalling language he used, particularly in respect of Paula Sheriff’s comments over the death of Jo Cox”.Corbyn said: “The Speaker has since drafted up a statement on behalf of us, which is to say: tone down the rhetoric, tone down the language.“‘Yes, political debate. Yes, political disagreement. Yes, passionate political thought but don’t use hyperbolic language that’s dangerous. Don’t use language that incites people to act in a dangerous way on the streets of our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dce0c2df77db0c506afcfda1695359f193894b2b/0_94_5421_3252/master/5421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56349dcd829c8c964677112f1a0ecba7","title":"rabbits may hold key to solving mystery of human female orgasm","story":"Study suggests climax may be an evolutionary hangover – but crucial questions remainA possible explanation for one of biology’s greatest mysteries, the female orgasm, has been bolstered by research showing that rabbits given antidepressants release fewer eggs during sex.The human female orgasm has long proved curious, having no obvious purpose besides being pleasurable. The scientists behind the study have previously proposed it might have its evolutionary roots in a reflex linked to the release of eggs during sex – a mechanism that exists today in several animal species, including rabbits.Since humans have spontaneous ovulation, the theory goes that female orgasm may be an evolutionary hangover. They say the new experiment supports the idea.To explore the question the team gave 12 female rabbits a two-week course of fluoxetine (trade name Prozac) – an antidepressant known to reduce the capacity for women to orgasm – and looked at the number of eggs released after the animals had sex with a male rabbit called Frank.Further experiments backed the theory that the drug was affecting ovulation through a mechanism involved in copulation and entailing the nervous system, rather than acting directly on the ovaries or other routes.The team said the results fit their theory that rabbits needed to experience something akin to an orgasm to have a hormonal surge and ovulate, although it is not known if it gives the animals sexual pleasure.They also said their theory was supported by a previous finding that animals that rely on sex-induced hormonal surges for ovulation tended to have a clitoris – the organ behind the female orgasm – in a position that meant it was more likely to be stimulated during sex.Pavličev said it remained unclear exactly how Prozac affected the reflex in rabbits, and that further experiments with other animals was necessary.She added that even if the theory was right, an important question was why is the organism still there – could it be that it had acquired a different function, that there was a function on female health?Elisabeth Lloyd, a professor of biology at Indiana University and author of The Case of the Female Orgasm, praised the study and said it offered support for the team’s theory.She said questions remained, including whether the same muscles and nerve fibres involved in the reflex in rabbits were present in the female orgasm. She also noted that ovulation and orgasm were linked to different hormones in humans, though it was unclear why – if female orgasm had its roots in ovulation – orgasms in men and women showed so many overlapping features.Such features, she said, had generally been thought to support the theory that orgasm evolved to reward males for fertilisation, with the female orgasm simply a bonus arising from the way embryos of different sexes develop from a common form. Lloyd and Pavličev said it might be that the theories could be reconciled, with one potentially explaining the origin of female orgasm and the other indicating why it still existed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b71194a89acece88fe1d9b7cd95741f0686d54c8/0_22_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=837a1aba41649e683ca47e4981d52800","title":"athletics coach alberto salazar receives four year ban for doping violations","story":"The US Anti-Doping Agency has banned American Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world’s top distance runners including British Olympian track champion Mo Farah, for four years for doping violations.Usada said Salazar’s punishment was for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, a camp designed primarily to develop US endurance athletes.Salazar, who also coached American Olympian Matthew Centrowitz among other top distance runners, trafficked banned performance-enhancing substance testosterone to multiple athletes, Usada said in a statement.Salazar also tampered or attempted to tamper with NOP athletes’ doping control process, the agency said after concluding its four-year investigation.Jeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for NOP on performance enhancement and served as a physician for numerous athletes in the training program, also received a four-year ban.Salazar, Nike and Brown could not be reached for comment. Salazar has in the past denied any wrongdoing.Several members of NOP are competing in the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Doha. None of the athletes Salazar has worked with were mentioned in Monday’s report.Salazar stopped coaching Farah in 2017 when the runner decided to move back to England. Farah said at the time that the doping investigation was not the reason they parted ways.“The athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,” Travis Tygart, Usada chief executive officer, said.“While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr. Salazar and Dr. Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.”Salazar, 61, was a celebrated distance runner, winning three consecutive New York City marathons starting in 1980.Nike funds NOP, the nation’s most elite long-distance running training centre, in Portland, Oregon, under a $460m 26-year sponsorship deal with US Track and Field.

She’s a very good mare and it’s great we are getting another opportunity to see her in Britain.”Deirdre is a general 16-1 shot for the Champion Stakes, the last of the 20-1 having disappeared during Monday. It is hard to be sure what quality of opposition she would face there as the top four in the betting – Japan, Magical, Ghaiyyath and Enable – are all expected to run in the Arc, so their presence at Ascot would depend on what happens this weekend.A tilt at the Breeders’ Cup in the US next month must be a possibility for Deirdre, especially as she is thought to appreciate fast ground. But Murphy believes Ascot is the main target for her owner and trainer, at least for the time being.There are 16 horses left in the Arc, following Monday’s declaration stage, including three Japanese representatives in Fierement, Blast Onepiece and Kiseki. Britain has the same number of possible runners in Enable, Mehdaayih and Ghaiyyath.Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Rouget offered little help to punters as he discussed the Arc chances of his French Derby winner, Sottsass. “I am going into the Arc with confidence, but with a horse who has never encountered Enable, who has never encountered Japan, who has never really met anyone,” he said.“So I have no reference. I can’t say he is going to take his revenge or anything. I don’t know. What I do know is that the horse is looking good, he is in good form. Everything is all right.”Jumpers usually get a sound surface at Southwell but the overnight rain has made it soft in places there and that could be good news for Applaus (3.40), who put up a few good efforts on testing surfaces a couple of winters back. After a spell pointing, he’s back with Micky Hammond and a couple of modest efforts on good ground have got him down to an attractive rating.He’s 10lb below his last winning mark, so here’s hoping the mud and the fitting of blinkers spark a revival. At 14-1, it’s a chance I can take.At Sedgefield, there’s been some support for Squouateur (4.30), now 4-1 for the staying handicap hurdle. JP McManus’s grey has been backed, mostly unsuccessfully, for much better races than this in his time, of course, and it was only last year that he was third in the Kim Muir. His form since joining Ben Haslam does not encourage but the soft ground could make a difference and he is certainly on a fair mark.Irish raiders are always worth a second look at Ayr and Highway To Heaven (1.50) appeals at 6-1 in the opener. Her form last month at Gowran easily makes her a contender in this company.Sagittarius Rising (4.20) finished fast but just too late at Listowel last month on his fourth start for John McConnell. Support for a couple of others has allowed him to drift to 9-1, which seems too big."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/558422e2447ff291bd3ecba17551026e6714c66b/0_47_2075_1245/master/2075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ec42013eff2d194145270f8058c4add","title":"vontaze burfict suspension nfl tackles","story":"The linebacker’s career has been a steady parade of grisly hits and cowardly acts. The league has finally taken him off the fieldVontaze Burfict has long been considered the NFL’s dirtiest player. And not in a misinformed, yearning for the good ol’ days, don’t-we-all-sneakily-enjoy-it way. His play is not tough but fair – it is vicious and violent. He does not look merely to tackle opponents, he often appears to be seeking to harm them too. So it’s little surprise that the 29-year-old has been suspended for the remainder of the 2019 season, after he delivered a barbaric head-to-head shot to Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle on Sunday.Burfict’s suspension will likely be reduced on appeal, as was the case with his five-game ban in 2017, which was later reduced to three. But this is more about messaging than the particulars of the ban. As the link between football and brain trauma grows, the NFL is trying to crack down on head injuries. Punishing him heavily is an easy, fan-friendly decision. But it’s also one that sends a strong message to every other locker-room: in the modern game, this type of violence not be tolerated.“There were no mitigating circumstances on this play,” Joe Runyan, the NFL’s vice president of football operations said in a letter to Burfict. “Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.” The criticism escalated. “You have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk,” Runyan wrote. Never has the league office offered such a forceful rebuke of a player’s on-field conduct. The NFL edged as close to publicly labeling Burfict a pariah as a corporation can possibly do while reprimanding a unionized employee.Burfict’s troubling pattern of behavior stretches back to high school. He was the top high-school recruit at his position in the country. Recruiting site 247 Sports listed Burfict as the 11th best prospect in the country and one of the 250 best prospects in the history of high school football he still ranks as the 39th best player to ever come out of the talent-rich state of California. But Burfict received few elite-level college scholarship offers, and he ended up at Arizona State, a third-rate program. The best of the best had heard all about Burfict’s reputation: he had serious anger issues, the story went. One by one they chose to pass.In football, passing up on a linebacker because he has anger issues is like passing on The Beatles because their music is too catchy. Linebackers are the tone setters in a brutish, collision-based sport. Find a linebacker with anger problems and you’ll see a trail of 40 coaches scuttling behind, certain in their belief that they’re the ones who can help channel that violence into controlled aggression.That wasn’t the case with Burfict. He had obvious first-round potential in the NFL draft, and teams loved his athleticism, instincts and tenacity. Yet he went undrafted. High school whispers had become facts in college, and he failed a drug test at the NFL combine. Executives and coaches across the league didn’t want to take the risk on a player with so many red flags.Those worries were realized once he signed as an undrafted free agent in Cincinnati. His years with the Bengals were marred by spells on the sidelines as suspensions and fines stacked up. The list speaks for itself:- September 2013: Fined $10,000 for striking an opponent in the groin and an additional $21,000 for a hit on a defenseless receiver in the same game.- October 2013: Fined $21,000 for spearing a receiver.- October 2014: Fined $25,000 for twisting the ankles of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton and tight end Greg Olson.- December 2015: Fined $69,000 for two unnecessary roughness penalties and ing at Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s knee.- January 2016: Fined $50,000 for hitting a defenseless receiver on the chin.- January 2016: Suspended three games and forfeits $500,000 in salary for a headshot on defenseless wide receiver Antonio Brown.- October 2016: Fined $75,000 for stepping on Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount.- November 2016: Fined $12,000 for giving the middle finger to Bills fans.- August 2017: Suspended three games – reduced from five – for a hit on a defenseless player.- March 2018: Suspended four games for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy.- October 2018: Fined $112,000 for multiple examples of unnecessary roughness in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.No other player in the league has that kind of rap sheet. The Bengals finally had enough at the end of last season, and Oakland’s so-called brain-trust snapped him up, handing out a fat free-agent contract and making him a team captain. Adding Burfict to a locker-room that included Antonio Brown and Richie Incognito, men with their own troubled histories, was supposed to spur the Raiders back to their glory days, to encourage a ferocious, old-school playing style. These were not cheap-shot artists, the Raiders insisted, these were misunderstood, blue-collar football players.Burfict’s time in the NFL has been a parade of grisly hits and cowardly acts. Oakland rewarded him, promoted him as a figurehead of their Make Football Great Again movement. The NFL enabled his behavior, too: we are only a week removed from Burfict randomly punching players at the end of a play. Finally, the league has seen sense and taken Burfict off the field, for the health of its players and to safeguard the future of the sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0edac656e5950816567c52723a3dfa0d741d0f1/627_145_6093_3656/master/6093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c0eeac8f6ad0b158126a2d0c3db5fb","title":"yorkshires road cycling championships in pictures","story":"The UCI road world championships took place in the Yorkshire dales amid relentless rainAbout 1,400 riders from 90 countries competed in the UCI road world cycling championships, which ploughed through the Yorkshire dales, culminating in Harrogate.Nearly 2 million spectators turned out to watch the 2019 Tour de Yorkshire and 4 million fans visited the county to support the Tour de France Grand Départ in 2014, among the largest crowds ever for cycling events in the UK.The peloton rolled out to the north of Bradford before the first categorised ascent on Norwood Edge, a winding ramp which distanced some of the weaker climbers. A final undulating approach into Harrogate and two laps of the city circuit proved a war of attrition before Annemiek van Vleuten won the world champion titleYorkshire hosted the first ever team time trial mixed relay, with national teams consisting of three male and three female riders. The men set off first and the women replaced them on the road as soon as the second male rider crossed the finish line. Final timings were taken when the second female rider crossed the line.It was the first UCI-sanctioned international para-cycling event to take place alongside the UCI road world championships and was used as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.The route headed in a south-westerly direction out of Northallerton, followed by a short, sharp ascent on the outskirts of Masham. After a fast section into Risplith, there was barely a flat metre of road. The riders had to keep something in reserve before one last blast into Harrogate and up to the finish line on Parliament Street.Mads Pedersen became Denmark’s first road world champion. “When I saw the finish line I hoped the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. After six-and-a-half hours on the bike there is not much left. You have to be focused and stay in front. Don’t get any bad luck. It’s every rider’s dream to wear that jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aaa8e9ecb7f6dbedf68ec2a34e2a0d7159fae19/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af14fc6056514dab6207283f6c82126f","title":"doha empty seats iaaf sellout world athletics championships","story":"IAAF’s sellout to Qatar was the first leg of a double which sees the 2021 follow-up take place in Eugene, Oregon, home of NikeWhen Adam Gemili walked towards his blocks in lane seven for his heat of the men’s 200m at the IAAF world championships in Doha on Sunday night, he looked up and waved to friends and family in the grandstand. They would not have been hard to spot among a crowd estimated at around 1,000 scattered around a stadium built for 40,000.On perhaps the worst weekend for athletics in the sport’s long history there seemed no end to the ways being found to insult the people who actually do the running, jumping and throwing. All the poisons to have entered the sport’s systems in recent times were pooling in the echoing emptiness of the air-conditioned Khalifa stadium.Later in the evening that same 1,000 or so watched Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the queen of Jamaica, win the women’s 100m ahead of Dina Asher-Smith, who was taking the first inidual medal for a British female sprinter since Kathy Cook in 1983. Nothing can stir the blood as profoundly and sometimes unexpectedly as athletics, and this was a wonderful race containing all the ingredients required for a memorable final of a blue-riband event.The 32-year-old Jamaican, a little ball of pure speed trailing her multicoloured hair like the tail of a psychedelic comet, was winning her fourth world title at the distance, to go with her Olympic gold medals in Beijing and London. Later she gave interviews while cuddling her son Zyon, whose birth in 2017 kept her away from the track for a year.Trailing the woman described by Michael Johnson as the greatest woman sprinter of all time by barely a tenth of a second, Asher-Smith is nine years younger and was giving notice that, barring mishaps, even more impressive achievements await as she matures and gathers experience. To look at these women in their moment of triumph one could easily imagine them to be representing a sport at the zenith of its popularity.And yet the 38,000 or so empty seats told a very different story: a tale of sickness, corruption, warped priorities and vested interests. That depressing message was only italicised when the lights dimmed before the 100m final, giving way to a hideous Vegas-style son-et-lumière, intended to impress us with the importance of the race we were about to watch. We already knew that, thank you very much. It would have been better to give these amazing women a full house to cheer them on and to award their lap of honour the reception it deserved.The way to sell athletics to a new generation is not to wrap it up in something resembling the staging of the latest worldwide tour from Rihanna or Taylor Swift. The secret of the most beautiful of sports is to be found in its simplicity and humanity. The public enjoyed the sight of Usain Bolt throwing a shape before and after a victory but it was incidental to his global appeal. What people really loved was the sight of a man sprinting faster than anyone had done before: so basic, so elemental, so pure.The pollution of that purity is something athletics has been fighting against for decades, and in particular from the day of the 1988 men’s Olympic 100m final: the one that gave its title to Richard Moore’s book, The Dirtiest Race in History. Six of the eight finalists that day in Seoul – and not just the disqualified winner on the track, Ben Johnson – were subsequently implicated in doping scandals. On Sunday night in Doha that shadow, now more than 30 years old, dimmed the spotlight falling on the men’s 100m medal ceremony. The man on the top step of the podium, Christian Coleman, recently escaped a ban for missing three drug tests on a technicality, while the doping history of Justin Gatlin, the runner-up, is too familiar to bear repeating. It was as if Bolt had never happened.Athletics is a resilient sport and there have been cherishable moments in the opening days of these world championships, as there always are on such occasions. There was Angelica Bengtsson of Sweden feeling a pole snap as she went into the take-off for her vault, then getting up and grabbing another one and setting off again to clear the bar. There was Braima Dabo of Guinea‑Bissau helping the heat‑stricken Jonathan Busby of Aruba to finish their 5,000m race, both far behind the winners. And the great Allyson Felix, another new mother, returning to win her 12th world title in the inaugural mixed 4x400m, itself a good entertainment which may or may not be destined for a permanent place in the programme.But then one remembers that two years after the lights go out in Doha the next IAAF world championships will take place in Eugene, Oregon, notable in terms of world athletics only for being the town where Nike was founded and has its world headquarters. Nike, the running shoe company who gave Sebastian Coe the contract that he was so loth to forfeit when he became president of the IAAF four years ago in succession to the man he once described as the sport’s “spiritual leader”, the disgraced Lamine Diack. Nike, the company whose negotiations with Felix over a new contract when she became pregnant started a battle over fair payment for sportswomen during the maternity period.The award of the championships to Eugene was made without transparency in any respect save that of the motives of those who also decided that it was right to hold a marathon in the heat of Qatar and were rewarded on Friday night with the sight of runners being taken to hospital in wheelchairs. One day the successors to those athletes will get the sport – and the audience – they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a662c26d03e25868bb94f375e13983d2cda129c0/0_108_4028_2416/master/4028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd4ad981f933840ad56aeb2b9d0a7ea","title":"ballet preljocaj la fresque review mesmerising dreams and fab hairdos","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonIt struggles to make an emotional connection, but this gorgeous-looking, pulsing tale of love is sprinkled with magicWhen your love interest is basically a mirage, it’s hard to establish much human connection. That’s the conundrum for French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj in La Fresque, based on an old Chinese tale of a man who falls in love with a woman in a painting and is transported into the world of the picture.What Preljocaj does capture very effectively is a dream state that grows increasingly hypnotic as the beat pulses on. The soundtrack from Air’s Nicolas Godin hops from simmering synth to west African groove to an outbreak of manic harpsichord, and, rather than build a single choreographic voice, Preljocaj shifts the character of the dance as each scene sheds its skin. It’s like waking into a new dream: one where dancers melt in jellified curves, one with slicing lines and pointed toes, one where they bounce en masse to the beat. The inidual steps are not always inspired, but the mood is conjured.Symbolising youthful beauty, hair is a major theme, whether tossed in sharp flicks of the head by the sirens in the painting (a la Rosas danst Rosas), tied into a marital knot (in homage to Bronislava Nijinska’s Les Noces, surely), or woven into a long rope reaching up to the ceiling that men climb up in a reverse Rapunzel. And it’s in the mesmerising projections by Constance Guisset, a sort of giant jellyfish made of fine, flowing strands.It all looks fab, expensive, gorgeous, including the bronze warrior catsuits and floaty, strappy dresses of Azzedine Alaïa’s costumes. The somewhat hollow journey of La Fresque may not teach us much, but this is a great-looking show that does have its moments of magic. • At Sadler’s Wells, London, until 2 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572/606_505_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba29311c226d35a1055b5aea7b91f26","title":"iphone 11 review iphone xr dual camera a13 smartphone","story":"Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessorThe iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XRXS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As an unpaid volunteer agricultural worker escaping from my London bubble, it was time to pull on my wellies and yomp across a muddy paddock to feed pigs. That was 6am on a freezing morning 18 months ago, and right from the start I was hooked.Burscombe Cliff Farm lies down a steep muddy lane on the side of a wooded escarpment in the Weald of Kent, at medieval Egerton village, near Ashford, just an hour down the M20 from my home. It has been welcoming “Wwoofers” for nearly 30 years, since the original Working Weekends on Organic Farms movement (now called World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, but still Wwoof) was founded in 1971. People of all ages and nationalities have fed the livestock, dug the veg patch, walked the young bulls and bunked down in the farm’s ancient caravans. Unlike me, most arrive by train or bike. But I got to go home piled high with fresh local produce and bags of compost.Our host is seventysomething former doctor Hilary Jones, who breeds award-winning Blonde d’Aquitaine cattle, gentle creatures the size of small elephants. She has been committed to sustainability since before ecotourism was a thing.A faded sticker – Nuclear Power No Thanks – reveals the remains of an old van once used to get to an Aldermaston march in a heap of brambles beyond her back door. For relaxation, Jones dyes and spins the wool from her sheep – in weld yellow, rose madder pink and indigo blue, and the bright orange she presses from onion skins. Nothing is wasted here. Everything is mended or repurposed. There is wifi, but no TV, just BBC Radio 3 and intelligent engaged chat to the click of knitting needles or the soothing clunk of the spinning wheel.The UK has more than 550 Wwoof hosts, dedicated organic farmers and smallholders promoting awareness of ecological management of our landscapes and wildlife by offering visitors bed, board and hands-on experience in exchange for six hours’ labour a day. There are also around 4,000 registered UK Wwoofers.In the 18 months I have been coming here, I have delivered lambs (“We are a grandmother”), groomed the prize bull, scythed a field, mended the greenhouse and learned to eat pigs whose ears I have scratched. It hasn’t turned me vegetarian, but I treat meat with more respect and buy less of it.Wwoofing this way, with regular return visits, is like walking into The Archers. I get updates on the fight to save the local shop and the library van, and chat to everyone from the artist neighbours in the cottage across the fields to the shepherd managing a large conventional flock on the next farm, the tractor man trying to set up his own decorating business, the veg box grower and passing hikers out enjoying the countryside.There are at least three regular Wwoofers at Burscombe Cliff: a teacher, a writer and a journalist. We could visit other farms and Wwoof in other countries – there are 132 member countries to choose from, and Australia, New Zealand and the US each has several thousand hosts – but we like it here, taking mini-breaks from our city lives, filling our lungs with fresh air and swinging our shoulders.Last week I popped back for a happy afternoon up a ladder in the orchard, picking apples. In the next weeks the cows will start coming in from the fields for calving, and the ram will go out to the ewes on 5 November for lambing in early April. In between, there are fences to mend, medlars to pick, broad beans and onion sets to plant, and above all logs to chop for the hungry Rayburn stove. There’s always plenty to do and winter is coming.• Find out more at wwoof.net.

His name conjures up images of sunsets, cowboy hats and Marlboro Reds. But the legacy of the late film star is undergoing fresh interrogation after a controversial 1971 Playboy interview resurfaced online in which the actor made racist and homophobic comments. Now, there are growing calls to rename the John Wayne airport, located in Orange county, in response to the actor’s troubling political views.The idea of renaming an airport because of a namesake’s controversial political views might have seemed far-fetched a decade ago, but not anymore.A host of public schools and colleges have renamed academic buildings and dorms that honor Confederate leaders. Efforts to rename DC’s Reagan airport, in response to Ronald Reagan’s war on crime, which disproportionately affected people of color, have been on-and-off since 2015. Barack Obama arguably cleared the way for major name-changes when he used his executive power to rename Mount McKinley to Denali, the mountain peak’s original name among the area’s indigenous population.So names can change.Up until now, John Wayne’s legacy has occupied a comfortable, permanent position in American history. Wayne starred in over 70 films, received a Congressional Medal of Honor and a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom.There are a lot of places named after him. There’s an elementary school in Brooklyn, a marina in Washington state, a highway in central Arizona, a park in Newport Beach.Wayne was disturbingly forthcoming and direct in the Playboy interview when it came to his racism. “I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility,” he told Playboy in 1971. “I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”Is it possible to rewrite the legacy of the biggest movie star of all time?“For many years, I have been troubled with the decision to name an airport after John Wayne because of his bigoted views on African Americans, the LGBT+ community and Native Americans,” Whiting says of his decision to write his isive call for action. “Although most of the hundreds of online and email comments are passionately negative, there are also notes of support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05d7eee223932962fbb414b02d1be8bff5fc2bd/0_191_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=568373ea0dc0cdbe073c7470aaf591c6","title":"russian alcohol consumption down 40 since 2003 who","story":"Reputation for heavy drinking on the slide since Putin measures including curbs on alcohol salesThe WHO put the decrease down to a series of measures brought in under the sport-loving president, Vladimir Putin, including restrictions on alcohol sales and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.“The Russian Federation has long been considered one of the heaviest-drinking countries in the world,” the report, published on Tuesday, says, adding that alcohol was a major contributor to a spike in the number of deaths in the 1990s. “However, in recent years these trends have been reversed,” it says.The authors said this trend was a factor in increased life expectancies in Russia, which reached a historic peak in 2018, at 78 years for women and 68 years for men. In the early 1990s, male life expectancy was just 57 years.The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, led an anti-alcohol campaign with partial prohibition, which brought down consumption from the mid-1980s until 1990. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, alcohol consumption exploded, continuing to rise until the start of the 2000s.Under Putin, Russia has introduced measures including a ban on shops selling any alcohol after 11pm, increases in the minimum retail price of spirits and an advertising blackout.Earlier WHO figures showed Russian adults drink less alcohol on average than their French and German counterparts.Moscow has also launched a drive against smoking, last week announcing a ban on lighting up, even on private balconies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dbb63734b992802064272e01b61725b3fa01b76/208_218_3292_1975/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13056c644cca98db600af637db4e8c5e","title":"tuesday briefing pms secret irish border plans dismissed","story":"Leaked reports of customs checks denied by No 10 … Trump impeachment escalates … and Debbie Harry on drugs, rape and robberyGood morning and welcome to the morning briefing with Alison Rourke on this very busy news week.A proposal to solve the quagmire of the Irish backstop has drawn scorn from Ireland’s deputy PM, Simon Coveney, who dismissed it as a “non-starter”. The plans, seen by the broadcaster RTÉ, involve border checks and real-time tracking devices on lorries and are part of four unofficial papers submitted by the UK to Brussels by Boris Johnson’s team. They include customs clearance sites five to 10 miles to the north and south of the Irish border, a U-turn on previous commitments. Traders would have the choice of lodging their papers at these sites, similar to the ones that existed before the single market came into existence, or electing to be tracked electronically in an online “transit” arrangement. A spokesman for Downing Street dismissed the claims: “Nothing we are proposing involves checks or controls at the border. That is an absolute commitment.” The proposals were also dismissed by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and Labour. The leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals on a revised Brexit deal that is due to go to Brussels in the next week.About face – The BBC has reversed its decision to sanction its presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines over her comments about Donald Trump. The director general, Tony Hall, said the complaints unit had made the wrong call. The U-turn came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence that showed the original complaint had been about both presenters involved in the segment – Munchetty and co-host Dan Walker – but only Munchetty was sanctioned. The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, had said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention him, despite the complaint being titled “blatant political bias from both presenters”. It also described Walker as “very unprofessional” and made it clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias,” the complaint said.Trump impeachment – In a fast-moving day of developments in Washington, new reports have revealed a wider role for the attorney general, William Barr, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in the unfolding scandal. Both men participated in contacts between Trump and leaders of at least four foreign countries, aimed at producing stories that could damage the president’s likely 2020 opponent, Joe Biden, or undermine the Russia-Mueller probe. Pompeo is also reported to have taken part in Trump’s now infamous call with the Ukrainian president that set off the impeachment inquiry and Barr flew to London and Italy to ask for help in “investigating” the roots of the Russia investigation, the Washington Post reported. Meanwhile it emerged that Trump himself asked Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, for help in discrediting the Mueller inquiry into 2016 election tampering, and Morrison agreed. The developments came after Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudi Guiliani, was subpoenaed by House congressional committees to produce documents related to his and Trump’s alleged attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son.‘Great nation’ – China has held a massive military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of Communist rule. Addressing crowds from Tiananmen Square, president Xi Jinping led tributes to “revolutionary heroes and martyrs” and said no force could “shake this great nation”. In reference to Taiwan, Xi said Beijing would “continue to strive for the complete reunification of our country”. On Hong Kong, he said China must remain “committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems”. Shortly after his speech, pro-democracy crowds began gathering in Hong Kong for what are expected to be large protests.Antarctic break off – An iceberg the size of Greater London has calved off the Amery ice shelf in east Antarctica. Scientists say it is not connected to climate change, but is part of the normal process of the continent’s evolution, where ice thins out at the very edge of shelves, sitting on top of water instead of being attached all the way to the ocean floor. According to Ben Galton-Fenzi, a glaciologist with the Australian Antarctic Program, the calving won’t directly affect sea levels “because the ice shelf was already floating, much like an ice cube in a glass of water”.In a July phone call between US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. An intelligence official decided to blow the whistle on the call. Lauren Gambino discusses how this has led to an impeachment inquiry. And: Joseph Harker on the start of Black History Month. Few women have been objectified as much as Debbie Harry. In her Blondie memoir, Face It, she reveals her addiction, a brutal robbery-turned-assault and why she still feels lucky. In the 1970s after a gig she and her boyfriend (and Blondie co-founder, Chris Stein) were held at knifepoint in their apartment by a man looking for drugs, who tied her up and raped her. She didn’t let it define her. “I had to consider what was important to me, and being a victim was really not who I wanted to be.” Perhaps minimising it has helped protect her from it? She smiles. “Yeah. Absolutely.”Her biggest mistake in her life, she says, was money. “That I didn’t pay more attention to business, and that I was really only interested in making music and performing.” In the 80s she and Stein lost everything. Their 1976 debut album, the eponymous Blondie, saw them tour the world for years, but they lost their New York townhouse and the IRS even took some of her clothes. Heroin was a big part of their lives , but she she got off it “just the way anybody does – go to a programme, or go into therapy. It’s not easy.” At 74, how does she feel about getting older? “It sucks,” she says with a laugh. There isn’t much she would have done differently in her life, she says. “We all make mistakes, but the thing is to learn from them. And make different mistakes.”The US Anti-Doping Agency has banned American Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world’s top distance runners including British Olympian track champion Mo Farah, for four years for doping violations. Ole Gunnar Solskjær insisted he was still confident of Manchester United having a successful year after a 1-1 draw with Arsenal condemned the 20-times Premier League champions to their worst start to a season for 30 years. Dina Asher-Smith insists she is not feeling the pressure to follow her 100m silver with a 200m world title – despite finishing fastest of all in the first round in Doha. The championships, blighted by small crowds, have so far been a PR disaster for athletics, for the sport’s president, Sebastian Coe, and for Qatar, writes Sean Ingle. England are backing their forward “tank” to propel them past Argentina this weekend and confirm their place in the last eight of the Rugby World Cup. Ardie Savea will make a small slice of history when he runs out for the All Blacks against Canada on Wednesday to become the first player to wear goggles in a World Cup match, a move the New Zealand forward says could save him from going blind. And it took nine-year-old Kade Lovell longer than expected to finish his 5km race in Minnesota, but only because he was busy accidentally winning a separate 10km event.The shared workspace operator WeWork has pulled plans for a share sale after ousting its founder and amid investor scepticism over its sky-high valuation. The decision leaves the rental company facing a cash crunch as its new bosses prepare to make deep cuts to stem its massive losses. WeWork had planned to start an investor roadshow earlier this month before an IPO. But the company, which had been valued at $47bn earlier this year, found investors worried by its valuation and by corporate governance issues.

The court documents contend that an Irish company used an Irish bank to transfer €185 million derived from the scheme onwards to an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates.

File photograph: Alan Betson The Minister for Education is planning to give history “special core status” in the junior cycle following a review on whether the subject should remain optional or not.It follows claims that the subject was due to be “downgraded” under junior cycle reforms, which gave all schools a choice over whether to study history or not.However, Joe McHugh’s decision means the subject will effectively become mandatory to study in some form for first, second and third year pupils.The decision amounts to a rejection of the advice given by the State advisory body on the curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), which has warned that making the subject mandatory could undermine junior cycle reforms.These reforms, which have taken years to devise and implement, are aimed at giving schools greater flexibility to meet students’ needs.Making more subjects mandatory, policymakers have argued, limits scope for schools to deliver other subjects such as science, languages, geography and others which are not mandatory.The move, however, will be welcomed by historians and many history teachers who have been campaigning for the subject to be made a core part of the curriculum.History has never been a mandatory subject in secondary school and has always been optional in about half of schools. In practice, however, more than 90 per cent of pupils at junior cycle study history.In a statement, Mr McHugh said he will request the support of the NCCA in devising a new structure for the junior cycle framework which includes history as a special core status for all schools.‘Strong case’“I am hugely grateful to the NCCA council and all its members for the work they have done to review the place of history in the junior cycle. The report was comprehensive and put forward a strong case,” he said.“I have given it full consideration over the last two months, as well as taking on board the views of many people I meet on a daily basis who dedicate their lives and careers to education and to nurturing the minds of young people.”He said our education system was “responsive and progressive enough” to allow for the junior cycle framework to be structured in such a way for history to have a special status.“I am seeking the support of the NCCA to examine how best that can be achieved and their expertise to design a special core status for history within the new junior cycle to meet the request.”Of the 21 subjects being offered under the new junior cycle, three of these – maths, English and Irish – are mandatory. The remaining 18 are optional.Schools are also obliged to ensure all children take studies related to wellbeing, a new subject, and “other areas of learning” which support key skills and areas of learning.Mr McHugh’s decision is aimed at inserting history as a special core subject alongside wellbeing, say informed sources.Other subjectsThe would make it obligatory to study the subject, but could still give schools freedom to provide a full course or potentially a new short course on history. These issues are set to be examined now by the NCCA.Mr McHugh’s move to give special status to history may lead to calls from other subjects such as geography, science and languages to also be given special status.Geography lecturers, for instance, argue that the importance of climate change merits its inclusion as mandatory subject, while Stem advocates say science and technology will be crucial for students in the modern workforce.However, the Minister has resisted such calls to date."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Hong Kong activist \u0026#39shot in chest\u0026#39 during protests on China\u0026#39s 70th anniversary - live updates Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses reports his Brexit deal will impose checks away from Irish BorderBritain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to UK graduate salariesBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsAustralian PM confirms Trump request to help investigate origins of Mueller inquiry Halloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationClocks change: why do we use GMT - and do we still need to?Duchess of Sussex arrives at Johannesburg University to discuss gender equalityRoyal Tour 2019: A guide to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s South Africa itinerary Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesSix trapped in fishing boats as Taiwan bridge collapses after typhoonUK weather: Heavy rain brings flooding - with more on the wayTuesday morning news briefing: PM to reveal final Brexit planWinter solstice 2019: Why do pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year?Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39underwater forests\u0026#39 could be key to beating climate change says Sir David AttenboroughComment: The loss of the Common Entrance exam is a dark day for British educationDowning Street and Scottish Tories agree to stonewall second independence referendum \u0026#39trigger\u0026#39 questionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 1 october 2019","story":"The Pallada tall ship being launched in the Pacific waters by the city of Vlaostok, after repair works at the Pervomaisky Shipyard.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  Adele has not released new music since her acclaimed third album 25. The English singer has made limited public appearances since then, fuelling speculation among fans that she is working on new material.Beyoncé’s most recent album was the soundtrack to this year’s Lion King remake.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearNoted commodity trader Peter Brandt predicted bitcoin will continue to fall until it reaches $5,500, but will then continue its upward trajectory.In the long term, he forecasted bitcoin to be worth $50,000 – a figure seen as conservative by some cryptocurrency advocates.Cyber security pioneer John McAfee, who has become a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, stood by a prediction he made in 2017 that bitcoin will see exponential price growth in 2019 and 2020.“Ignore this drop in bitcoin’s price. I am firmly with Peter Brandt in his medium term $50k price prediction,” Mr McAfee tweeted.“I am also firm on my $1m price by the end of 2020. Stop wringing your hands!”It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for bitcoin’s most recent demise, though some have said negative market sentiment can be attributed to the launch of the bitcoin futures platform Bakkt.Pessimism surrounding Bakkt resulted in a mass sell-off, which at one point saw more than $1,000 wiped from bitcoin’s value in the space of 30 minutes.Bitcoin’s notorious volatility could see traders once again plough money into the cryptocurrency in the hope of turning a quick profit, according to market analyst Simon Peters, who works for online trading platform eToro.“Now that bitcoin is now trading below $8,500, it could become an attractive proposition for investors who want to buy the dip,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We could see the price rise back up to $10,000 within the space of the next month.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though he gave a different address, it is speculated that Marley did so to prevent the police from searching the house in Oakley Street – where his bandmates were staying – for drugs.Created with Sketch.Bob Marley and the Golden Age of Reggae Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Other anecdotal reports from witnesses suggested the house was the band’s headquarters and Marley’s primary address.The plaque was unveiled by Rastafarian writer and poet Benjamin Zephaniah and introduced by historian and broadcaster David Olusoga, who is also a blue plaque panel member.Zephaniah, said: “It’s very difficult to say what Bob Marley would have said about this plaque, but he did once say, ‘Live for yourself, you will live in vain, live for others, and you will live again’, so I’m quite sure he would say that this is for his people and his music.”Additional reporting by the Associated PressThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to its website, the company has three stores in the UK – in Birmingham, Liverpool and London.In a message to customers posted on its website, Forever 21 said it is still deciding which US stores to shut, depending on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with landlords.It added: “Our stores are open and it will continue to feel like a normal day – you will not see any changes in our stores, gift cards will continue to be accepted and our policies, including returns and exchanges, remain the same.”The 35-year-old company has 815 stores in 57 countries, over 500 of them in the US. Once popular with teenagers for its trendy, low-price designs, Forever 21 has buckled in the face of high rents and competition from online retailers. Young Americans are also increasingly turning away from throw-away clothes, preferring second-hand and environmentally friendly products.If Forever 21 closes its UK stores, it will join an army of brick-and-mortar retailers in Britain that have wobbled or collapsed outright in recent years.Among the more high-profile failures, Debenhams and L.K.Bennett went into administration in the spring, while House of Fraser and Coast met the same fate last year.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes up over 7 per cent of Britain’s GDP, around 9 per cent of our exports and 11 per cent of all tax receipts. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe quarterly survey by the CBI and PwC showed that optimism has plunged at the fastest rate since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering panic around the world. Only 5 per cent of firms are now more upbeat about the overall business situation than three months ago, while 62 per cent are less optimistic, giving a balance of -56 per cent.Business volumes declined in the past three months at the fastest pace since September 2012. Banks experienced a particularly alarming fall, with the volume of business dropping more rapidly than at any time since March 1991.Meanwhile, the fall in profits across financial services firms was the worst since June 2009 when Britain was still mired in recession. And firms expected profitability to slide further in the next three months.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two tourists pose for pictures in front of Union and EU flags outside the Houses of Parliament in LondonA sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

No ifs, no buts, the government must heed the call to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit and secure an ambitious deal with our largest trading partner.”Whether Britain will leave the EU with or without an agreement, financial services firms said Brexit will have a negative impact on their business over the coming year.A wider survey released on Monday found the same view among UK firms across sectors, with concerns intensifying sharply since August.In a rare positive finding, the CBIPwC survey revealed that employment across financial services grew at the fastest pace in over a year. Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the increase was most probably a response to greater regulation requirements.The poll was conducted between 14 August and 13 September, with 83 firms replying.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to its website, the company has three stores in the UK – in Birmingham, Liverpool and London.In a message to customers posted on its website, Forever 21 said it is still deciding which US stores to shut, depending on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with landlords.It added: “Our stores are open and it will continue to feel like a normal day – you will not see any changes in our stores, gift cards will continue to be accepted and our policies, including returns and exchanges, remain the same.”The 35-year-old company has 815 stores in 57 countries, over 500 of them in the US. Once popular with teenagers for its trendy, low-price designs, Forever 21 has buckled in the face of high rents and competition from online retailers. Young Americans are also increasingly turning away from throw-away clothes, preferring second-hand and environmentally friendly products.If Forever 21 closes its UK stores, it will join an army of brick-and-mortar retailers in Britain that have wobbled or collapsed outright in recent years.Among the more high-profile failures, Debenhams and L.K.Bennett went into administration in the spring, while House of Fraser and Coast met the same fate last year.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes up over 7 per cent of Britain’s GDP, around 9 per cent of our exports and 11 per cent of all tax receipts. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe quarterly survey by the CBI and PwC showed that optimism has plunged at the fastest rate since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering panic around the world. Only 5 per cent of firms are now more upbeat about the overall business situation than three months ago, while 62 per cent are less optimistic, giving a balance of -56 per cent.Business volumes declined in the past three months at the fastest pace since September 2012. Banks experienced a particularly alarming fall, with the volume of business dropping more rapidly than at any time since March 1991.Meanwhile, the fall in profits across financial services firms was the worst since June 2009 when Britain was still mired in recession. And firms expected profitability to slide further in the next three months.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two tourists pose for pictures in front of Union and EU flags outside the Houses of Parliament in LondonA sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

People with houses lining the parade route were told not to look out of their windows.As the parade gathered in the square, Mr Xi descended to street level and inspected row upon row of gleaming military hardware. Riding in a black limousine he shouted: “Hello comrades”, to replies from the soldiers of “Follow the Party! Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!”The event highlighted rapidly developing Chinese weapons technology that foreign analysts say is close to matching the US, Russia and Europe in missiles, drones and some other fields.China’s campaign of military modernisation has alarmed its neighbours in the region, not least because Beijing lays claim to the entirety of the contested South China Sea, as well as independently-run Taiwan and some Japanese islands.One of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled Tuesday was the Dongfeng-17, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to manoeuvre at high speed to evade anti-missile defences.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Beijing says it wants a “minimum credible nuclear deterrent” but won’t be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.And Mr Xi also emphasised China’s commitment to “firmly uphold world peace”, saying that the country would pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.After the military aspect of the parade was complete, 70,000 balloons and 70,000 doves – symbolising peace – were released into the smoggy Beijing air. A large fireworks display is planned for the evening.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If I get my sight back I’ll never wear contacts again.As well as infections, contact lens wearers need to watch out for lenses going missing — in their eyes.Last year, one Dundee woman found shed had a contact lens stuck behind her eye for  years without realising.The unnamed -year-old went to her GP when her upper left eyelid became droopy and swollen.An MRI revealed she had a cyst, which was identied as a rigid gas permeablecontact lens lodged behind the eyelid.The woman had been hit in the eye with a shuttlecock during a game of badminton when she was .She looked for the lens at the time but couldnt find it, and assumed it had been knocked out and lost.The lens was only found by stunned surgeons during an operation to remove the cyst from her eye.Publishing the astonishing find in the British Medical Journal, Dr Sirjhun Patel and colleagues wrote: During surgery, an encapsulated cyst was found.On removal, the cyst ruptured and a hard contact lens was extracted.Make sure you always:And make sure you never:Source: NHSAnd some cases of missing contact lenses are just baffling — and revolting.In , doctors found not one, but  contact lenses stuck in the eye of a forgetful patient.Perplexed medics made the disgusting discovery while preparing a -year-old woman for a routine cataract operation.They spotted a blueish mass in the patients eye which, one closer inspection, was  lenses stuck together with eye mucus.Another  lenses were separately found in the womans eye.Speaking with Optometry Today at the time, ophthalmologist Rupal Marjaria who dealt with the case said: None of us have ever seen this before.It was such a large mass. All the  contact lenses were stuck together.We were really surprised that the patient didnt notice it because it would cause quite a lot irritation while it was sitting there.As well as prescription lenses, novelty fancy dress contacts can also pose a danger.An -year-old Canadian girl went blind for four days last year after wearing coloured contact lenses while trick-or-treating last Halloween.Emilie Turcotte woke up screaming in pain the morning after as her eyes were burning like fire.She was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated her blood red eyes while she couldnt see anything for four days.They eventually discharged her and ordered Emilie to wear sunglasses for a month to let her damaged corneas heal.Her mum, Julie, told the Montreal Journal: For four days we were so scared. She could not see anything.All that for Halloween contact lenses.With Halloween just over a month away, experts are now warning party-goers about the dangers of novelty contact lenses this year too.According to Feel Good Contacts, lenses should only be worntheyre a prescription from a qualied optician and its illegal for them to be sold where.Ashish Marthur, Eye Care Expert at Feel Good Contacts said: It is advisable that you avoid buying them from street vendors, salons, beauty supply stores, boutiques, flea markets, novelty stores, Halloween stores, convenience stores or untrustworthy internet sellers."},{"url":null,"title":"demi moore one drama to another","story":"One of the many revelations was about her knickers being exposed on social media in a photo taken by her then husband Ashton Kutcher, who is said to be not best pleased about how he is portrayed in the book, Inside Out.I’m not sure Demi fully realised the impact of her “warts-and-all” memoirs, including claims that Kutcher — her much younger third husband — cheated on her and instigated “threesomes”.He’s moved on, now has a ­family with we Mila Kunis and knows that one day his two kids will read all about his behaviour during his ­marriage to Demi and find it highly embarrassing.She saw the actor,  years her ­junior, as a way to press the restart button and relive her youth all over again, but this time with a chance ofhappiness. It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you ”Right, well in the immortal words of Samuel L Jackson: “Allow me to retort.”How dare we  No. How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.I’m sorry Ms Thunberg, butyou’re going to lay into my generation, you must accept it when I lay into you and yours.What about the pills you take when you have a headache What about the clean water that comes out of your tap  What about the food you can buy at any time of the day and night No -year-old was responsible for any of that.What about the aid missions currently being run in some of the poorest countries of the world, or the drugs that help keep Aids at bay Think about all the movies you’ve enjoyed.

They actually said, “Yes, dear.” And did.What they should have done is point out that le is tragic.Some people are born bright and some are born stupid.Some are beautul and some are not.Some have rich parents who give them everything but love.Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love.Now shut up and let them get on with it.This is how the world works. It’s how the world has always worked.And banging your fists on the table won’t change a thing. You’ll learn that when you’ve got a few more years under your belt.I agree with you that the world is heating up. You may even be right that man has something to do with it.And there is no doubt that as deserts eat into currently habitable places in Africa and the Middle East, Europe will face an unimaginable refugee crisis.Something needs to be done about that.

And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.And the best business brains don’t come cheap.SAM Smith, who’s a singer I think, announced recently that “he” doesn’t consider “himself” to be a man or a woman and wants everyone to refer to “him” as “they” in future.They said on Instagram that they have been at war with themselves for . . . oh, I give up.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The package of measures will “end low pay altogether”, he said.He also told the Tory faithful: “The hard work of the British people really is paying off.“It’s clear it’s the Conservatives who are the real party of labour. We are the workers’ party.”But businesses baulked because of the extra costs for them. And Treasury aides would not deny last night that the moves may hike employers’ wage bills by £billion.In a jam-packed speech, Mr Javid also outlined his plan to roll out new bus networks and bring back scrapped routes. And he:Mr Javid’s low-pay action means minimum-wage workers will be paid p an hour more than they were expecting by . Before his intervention, the wage was forecast to be £. an hour within five years.The move is also a key general election move to try to see off Labour’s promise of raising the minimum wage to £ immediately.A source close to the Chancellor said: “We’ve got a battle with Labour in this space, we need to own it.”An aide to Mr Javid — who is the son of a bus driver who came from humble roots — added: “This is a personal issue for Sajid, he knows what low pay looks like.”Campaigners welcomed the moves. Resolution Foundation think tank boss Torsten Bell said it “will take UK to top of the minimum wage league”.But business chiefs warned it would run the risk of putting small firms out of business.UKHospitality, which represents businesses employing service-industry workers, dubbed it “a double whammy of a further unprecedented cost increase”.And the Federation of Small Businesses’ national chairman Mike Cherry called on Mr Javid to institute “more support to help small employers” meet his ambition.The Chancellor also tore into Labour, delighting the Manchester audience, which included the PM’s special advisor Dominic Cummings.Even he has excelled himself by ­promoting a famously debunked conspiracy theory about Brexit.Remainer Hammond seriously claims Boris Johnson is “backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit”. This smear has zero evidence. Remain-backing City experts and even former ­Labour advisers say it makes no sense.Not only that, but Boris badly wants a deal. No Deal is just the fallback.This goes beyond Hammond’s usual rubbish. Here is a former statesman so deranged by Brexit that he will use baseless fiction to tarnish the leader of the party he represented for decades.In July he was running the nation’s finances. Now he is a broken backbencher, with no party, in a tinfoil hat.His successor is very dferent.Sajid Javid’s surprise announcement of a thumping rise to the Living Wage will be great news for four million low-paid workers, many of them Sun readers.With the age threshold lowered from  to , it’s a bonus for millennials too.Firms will fret about extra costs. That’s a minor worry next to the nightmarish burdens of a Corbyn Government. If anything we’d bring the rise in faster.The Sun urged Boris to pick a dynamic Chancellor after three years of Hammond. And Saj is off to a flier.Mr Javid mocked Jeremy Corbyn over his confusing flip-flopping on leaving the EU. Playing with the Labour logo, he dubbed him “a man with many Brexit positions, not the few”.Mr Javid also insisted he and his next-door neighbour Boris Johnson were “partners” with a very close working relationship — despite rumours of tensions between them.And the Chancellor delivered an impassioned plea on the need to deliver Brexit.While conceding No Deal had risks, he said: “The most reckless course of all would be to not deliver Brexit at all.“If we fail to deliver on the instruction of the British people, we are in danger of tearing the very fabric of our democracy.A fabric that has been carefully woven together over centuries. Andwe do that, I fear we may not be able to stitch it up again.“If people are going to have faith in the ballot box, we absolutely have to follow through on that vote.”Tomorrow the conference will hear from Home Secretary Priti Patel as she vows to restore the Tories’ battered reputation on law and order.She will tell voters that the Government has listened to their worries about the bloodshed on Britain’s streets.And she will declare: “To the police service — we back you. And to the criminals I simply say this — we are coming after you.”Her speech comes just days after she announced plans to hand Taser guns to , more cops.Separately last night, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland unveiled plans to axe automatic early release for serious violent criminals and sexual offenders.Instead of being let out halfway through their sentences, they will now have to spend at least two-thirds of it behind bars.The new proposals mean a rapist sentenced to  years will have to serve . years instead of seven.The Chancellor asked his mum Zubaida: “Did you ever think we’d be here  Do you remember Dad’s first shop used to be just down the road ”Rochdale-born Mr Javid added: “Mum thought it was a big deal when she watched the first Asians move into Coronation Street, here in Manchester.“Well, now she’s watched as the first Asians move into Downing Street.”Mr Javid also teased Downing Street neighbour Boris Johnson. He said: “We share the same vision of One Nation conservatism and we spend the same amount of time brushing our hair.”Mr Buckland said: “We’re going to restore faith in the sentencing system. We believe release should be earned. We owe it to the victims.”It wouldn’t cover murderers, as they already have to serve their whole tarf before going in front of the Parole Board.Boris Johnson has already vowed to hire , more police officers and ensure child killers get “le” terms.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and serve the people as a formation of fighter jets trailing coloured smoke swooped low over the capital.Speculation was re as to what weapons would be unveiled, with parade rehearsals showing missiles and aircraft under camouflage wraps.One of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled on Tuesday was the Dongfeng-, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to manoeuvre at high speed to evade anti-missile defences.The Chinese government is keen to assert its dominance in Asia and particularly in the South China Sea where it has been busy building militarised islands in international waters.And its clear message to the US is that it is getting closer than ever to matching it in terms of military might.A defence ministry spokesman recently said Beijing had no intention to flex its muscles but was instead keen to show a peace-loving and responsible China.But, President Xi Jinping warned at the event: No force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation.The major ceremony was held to mark the day that Mao Zedong pronounced the founding of the Peoples Republic of China on October ,  from the imposing Tiananmen Gate.China’s Communist Party celebrated its th anniversary in power with a military parade.Showcasing its most advanced weapons, those revealed for the first time included hypersonic-glide missiles that experts say could be dficult for the US to counter.The Peoples Liberation Army , the worlds biggest military with two million men and women in unorm, will be able to access a dizzying array of new weapons, such as:State media said % of the arms shown in the parade were appearing in public for the first time.This hardware included new and revamped versions of missiles, such as the long-range submarine-launched and ship-based YJ-A anti-ship cruise missiles.China only displays systems it says have entered some form of service, though analysts believe some of the new equipment could be experimental or prototypes.For example, the Gongji-, described as an attack drone and the final version of the Sharp Sword drone that first flew in , was displayed for the first time on the back of a truck.China showed jets in aerial refuelling formation, and the Z- medium lt helicopter - similar to a US UH- Black Hawk - also made its public debut.China has about  nuclear warheads, compared with , for America and , for Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .The military showed off Chinas most advanced weapons, some being shown for the first time, as rows of soldiers marched in lockstep past President Xi Jinping and other leaders in Tiananmen Square, the countrys symbolic political heart.Thousands of spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew low overhead.The partys emphasis on missiles and other long-range weapons reflects Beijings desire to displace the United States as the regions dominant force and enforce claims to Taiwan, the South China Sea and other disputed territories.The high-profile parade included , troops, more than  aircraft and  pieces of military equipment, according to Ministry of Defence spokesman Major General Cai Zhijun.A supersonic drone, hypersonic missile and a robot submarine were also shown off.But all eyes were primed for whether the huge Dongfeng missile would roll through Tiananmen Square in its debut public appearance.Many new weapons “will be shown for the first time,” Cai told reporters last week. Asked whether that would include the DF-, Cai said, “Please wait and see.”No details of the DF- have been released, but the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said it may have the world’s longest range at , kilometres.US nuclear tipped missiles fall a few thousand kilometres short of that.Analysts say the DF-, flying at  times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the US in  minutes with up to  warheads for separate targets.China’s current mainstay missile the Dongfeng- — Dongfeng means “east wind” — has a range of more than , kilometres that puts most of the continental US within reach.A version of this story originally appeared on news.au.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nearly  rangers were gunned down by poachers between  and .Local poachers hunt wildle - like leopards, lions or monkeys - then deliver carcasses to ‘fronts’ owned by international crime syndicates and with links to Jihadis.Rhino horn can be more valuable on the black markets than cocaine or heroin, making the exotic animal trade the fourth most lucrative illegal activity in the world behind drugs, arms and human trafficking.Malawis poverty and corruption has made it South Africas number one trafficking route for ivory trafficking.Yet, despite massive efforts and UK funds being pumped in, no foreign national has been convicted in Malawi.From the killing fields of Zambia and Mozambique to the traffickers streaming through Malawi, we lt the lid on the illegal wildle trade which remains one of the most brutal industries in the world...The huge sums of money at stake have made poaching a lucrative trade for criminal organisations and terrorist groups.Poachers linked to the Jihadi group Boko Haram are believed to have slaughtered , forest elephants in a single region of Gabon over  years – leading to the deployment of British troops to the region in .Shocking images of a mutilated elephant corpse show sick poachers often cut the animals head in half to remove its tusks.Other elephants and lions have ended up maimed by metal traps laid out by poachers.Lions have become a target recently because so many rhinos have been wiped out and the big cats are easier to poach because they scavenge which means poachers can poison them with meat before hacking off their faces and paws.“If you take out the word wildle and think about it in terms of crime and its value to a country, these resources – be it for tourism or whatever – are being lost,” says Mary Rice, executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency.“It’s a hugely serious criminal activity and it’s highly likely that some of these iniduals are involved in other trades, like firearms and money laundering. It’s all interlinked.”As well as being barbaric, the poaching trade is forcing many species towards extinction.Over the last  years the global number of black rhinos has dropped from , to ,, while the African Rhino could disappear by .Scaly anteaters called Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal because of their hides and meat, and are particularly vulnerable as they curl into a ball when threatened.Over the last  years alone a million have been taken from the wild - in another  they could be completely gone.After the animals have been murdered, their hides and bones are cut into small bits, put in containers and moved through neighbouring countries where border police have been paid off. This is known as ‘owning the road’.Eventually, they make their way across continents to Asia, where there is a high demand in countries like China and Vietnam for ivory goods, furs and ornaments. Ivory is even ground into a powder then sold as Chinese medicine.Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles led an international wildle conference in  to highlight the problem of poaching, with Charles warning there wasnt a moment to lose when it came to protecting endangered animals.It led to the total ban on trading ivory in the UK - regardless of its age - last year, while in Malawi the government also toughened up laws.Five years ago, the average punishment for poaching in Malawi was a £ fine – in  it was a five-year jail term.The country has also pumped money into new investigation units, in part thank to UK funding, leading it to become the ‘golden child’ of the conservation world.Javier Montano, from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, says a multi-agency approach is critical.Wildle trafficking needs to be treated as a serious crime, he says. “We hope that Malawi’s strong efforts in addressing and combating illegal wildle trade to date are reflected in the courtrooms in the coming months.”And it seems that might be the sticking point.Malawi has been linked to record hauls in Singapore, China and Australia, but is yet to convict a single foreign national caught trafficking.In contrast, neighbouring Tanzania jailed four Chinese smugglers for  years for rhino smuggling.“What we’re seeing is they track down these syndicates and networks and they use the full force of the law to arrest them,” says Rice.“But then corruption creeps in. We see some of these iniduals who should be receiving strict sentences being let off with lenient penalties.Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed every year for their ivory tusks.The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery – China is the biggest consumer market for such products.The ban on international trade was introduced in  by CITESafter years of unprecedented poaching.In the s, an estimated , elephants were being killed per year and up to % of herds were lost in some regions.The ban allowed some populations to recover, especially where elephants were adequately protected.But there has been an upsurge in poaching and illegal ivory trafficking in recent years, driven by increasing demand in Asia, which has led to steep declines in forest elephant numbers and some savannah elephant populations.Insufficient anti-poaching capacity, weak law enforcement and corruption undermine efforts to stop the poaching and trafficking in some countries.Source: WWFIts hoped this could change as the country awaits the sentencing of an alleged wildle trafficking ring led by notorious ivory kingpin Yun Hua Lin, .Ten Chinese Nationals and four people from Malawai have been charged with possessing rhino horn, ivory, pangolin, hippo teeth and firearms.We have capacity issues, but so far Malawi is becoming a safe home for wildle, Brighton Kumchedwa, director of the Department of National Parks.These arrests are now sending a strong message that we are no longer a playground for wildle trafficking.Rice agrees that country has in many ways become a success story, but warns nothing can be taken for granted.I think they still need that eye on the country to help the government, prosecutions and NGOs to help get beyond the corrupt elements, she explains.“So it’s a really good opportunity with Prince Harry visiting.He’s done a lot to help raise the profile in the country but it’s still really grappling with the problem.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly .

The defendant was with a friend.Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield were sat together waiting for the train when they accidentally bumped into the defendant who started shouting at ‘do not f***ing bump into me.”Ms Lauchlan said that the victim had told the Ms Peereboom to put a stop to the argument as they all made their way onto the train but as it pulled into Reading station she allegedly launched an attack.The prosecutor said: As Ms Jones stood up she felt her hair pulled with enough force to pull her into a seat.“As people tried to get the defendant off her, the other victim had her hair pulled and received an injury to her ankle.”Gabriella Marabet, , who was a student at the time, said: I had drunk around a bottle of Prosecco and three gin and tonics at the Newbury races with my family and friends but I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford.I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair. I kicked out and my leg was grabbed by the same girl who had my hair.I was bitten just above the knee which felt like for ages but it was about  seconds long. I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.The jury of nine women and three men was shown body-worn camera police footage of Ms Marabet and her family and friends on the  shouting after the incident.Ms Marabet said: I was furious, I was shouting that I had been bitten but I did not feel that it was dealt with accordingly by police officers at the time.When asked by defence counsel Kate Parker whether this commotion was the act of a sober person, the victim defended her actions blaming her anger and emotion on being upset that police treated her and her party as the culprit despite telling them she was the victim.Ms Lauchlan said: Ultimately, Gabriella Marabet was put in handcuffs and so was her step-brother and her party was warned they might be arrested. However, they were just detained until they calmed down.The jury was shown pictures taken by Ms Marabet of her bite injury the day after the incident.She said: I had a bite mark and a sore head from where my hair was pulled. I went to the doctors and I had to receive a Tetanus jab once a month for three months and a course of antibiotics.I have a scar now. I have just got back from holiday and it looks worse now as the skin around it is darker.Eliza Peereboom appears on the  StarNow where she states she is an out-going person who loves fashion, keeping fit and doing her makeup.The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"pygmy elephant poachers 70 bullet holes sawn off tusks","story":"The barbaric snaps of the baby pygmy elephant on Borneo emerged on the same day Prince Harry watched British and Malawian soldiers put on an anti-poaching exercise on his African tour.The Duke of Sussex looked on as local rangers and UK military were put through their paces at Liwonde National Park, Malawi.But on the same day, wildle park vets on the south east Asian island of Borneo were left sickened after images emerged of a tiny elephant brutalised by ivory poachers who left its carcass floating in a river.The endangered mammal was one of only , surviving Borneo Pygmy elephants left in the wild.His body was found on September  with more than  bullet holes, missing its tusks, and tethered by a rope to a tree on the riverbank on the Malaysian side of Borneo island.Local reports say heavy machinery had to be used to lt the elephant from the water and post-mortem examination later found one of the bullets went through the elephant’s right temple.Officials are now looking for up to five poachers while Sabah’s Wildle Department director Augustine Tuuga has branded the killing “cruel.The royal beamed as he watched the troops practice their vital mission to protect the elephants living in the reserve.He was seen chatting with men in military fatigues as he shielded himself from the African sun under a baseball cap which he teamed with a pair of dark glasses.Kalashnikov toting and machete wielding men were seen posing as ivory poachers during the exercise.The Duke has been a vocal opponent of the Ivory trade for years along with his older brother, William.He dedicated the park and an adjoining forest to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy.The initiative begun in  as a network of forest conservation programmes throughout the  countries of the Commonwealth of Nations.Earlier Harry paid tribute to a Brit soldier who was trampled to death by elephants while protecting them from poachers.The Duke of Sussex honoured Guardsman Mathew Talbot, , who died during a mission to stop the illegal slaughter of wildle in Malawi in May this year.Mathew, who was from Birmingham, was described as an exceptionally kind and friendly inidual by those who served alongside him.In Malawi Mathew was often to be found befriending the locals and learning their language.He also became good friends with the Gurkhas attached to the team and took time to try and learn Nepali.Mathew was a keen photographer and documented his time in the military with countless albums of his work.Earlier Harry appealed for increased global efforts to protect the environment against human greed, apathy and selfishness.He is also set to join an anti-poaching patrol with rangers in Liwonde National Park to highlight their fight against poachers whose activities endanger the survival of elephants, rhinos and other species.The prince viewed a tree sculpture crafted from recovered poachers snares and unveiled a plaque dedicating the adjoining Mangochi Forest to the Queens Commonwealth Canopy.Later he will guest-edit the National Geographic magazines Instagram account to encourage people worldwide to appreciate the ecological importance of trees, Buckingham Palace said.Conservation used to be a specialist area, driven by science. But now it is fundamental to our survival and we must overcome greed, apathy and selfishnesswe are to make real progress, Harry told the Daily .This may well sound hippy to some, but we cannot afford to have a them or us mentality. Humans and animals and their habitats fundamentally need to co-exist or within the next  years our problems across the globe will become even more unmanageable.Essentially, I am personally driven by the desire to help restore the balance between humans and nature. It is being in Africa that makes me fully understand and appreciate this.In todays Looking Up campaign, Harry will post pictures taken by National Geographics photographers - including from the Malawi park he is now visiting - to help raise awareness of the vital role trees play in the Earths eco-system.He will share a selection of the most beautul images of trees at the end of the day on @SussexRoyal.He will visit a health centre, pharmacy and youth reproductive health outreach programme in Malawi.Then on Wednesday he will be back with Meghan and Archie in South Africa for a township visit near Johannesburg.They will also meet Graca Machel, widow of South African anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, and President Cyril Ramaphosa before departing for London.On Sunday he visited a school in Malawi and was joined on Skype by his we who has remained in South Africa with their son."},{"url":null,"title":"armed gang behaving like animals","story":"NewsArmed gang behaving like animals try to smash their way into Aldi storeThe gang, wielding poles and wearing knuckle dusters, attempted to break into the branch in South Ruislip on Monday eveningShareCommentsByCharlie Lawrence-JonesLorraine King:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video happened-brave-staff-customers-step-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news armed-gang-behaving-like-animals-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Joanna Brett said she felt like crying by the way son Sebastian, who has undiagnosed gross motor delay, was treated at the theme park in Windsor at the weekend before going on the Ninjago ride. She claims staff said Sebby had to prove he was able to walk aposthree stepsapos while holding her hand in order to prove that he could safely be evacuated in an emergency or would be refused entry. She said: It was pretty horric. Weaposd gone in via the wheelchair entrance and we went to the front of the ride. But someone came up to us and said that Seb needs to demonstrate that he can walk three steps or he canapost go on. And he was only allowed to do it holding on to one of our hands because itaposs their evacuation policy. I thought it was ridiculous, heaposs in a wheelchair.  So we managed to do it, we got on the ride but another staff member came up and said that we needed to do it again. Itaposs hard work for him, I didnapost knowhe could do it again. But he did it again, in front of everyone, whilst the ride was delayed. It was obvious that we were the reason for the delay. It was just so embarrassing.  Now the mum-of-two has told how bubbly Sebastian was left upset following the incident, which saw them stay in the resort hotel overnight. She said: My son is the chattiest person in the world, you canapost talk when heaposs around you. And he just went quiet, which meant he was upset. Throughout the whole process, he didnapost say anything. And then in the lt on the way back down, he asked aposwhy did they make a disabled person walk  It really upset me, it was really hard.apos He mentioned it quite a few times yesterday but we tried not to focus on it. He met Lego Batman which made him feel better but for a while he was quite quiet. Weaposre hoping that it doesnapost spoil the experience, weaposre hoping that he remembers that he did get to go on the Ninjago ride, because it would have been upsettinghe hadnapost. Joanna added: One of the issues is that Seb was tested in front of people. And the staff were terrible, it wasnapost their fault, they just havenapost been trained.  The problem was with the way they spoke over him instead of to him. If they felt itaposs necessary to test him, which I donapost believe it is, why donapost they do it at the beginning of the day and give him a pass  More to the point, why isnapost a park inclusive in this day and age  How can Lego, a massive company, be so lacking in disability inclusion  I understand health and safety and not everything can be accessible, but for so little to be accessible is shocking.  Now Joanna has called on staff to be retrained as she said the experience left her son devastated alongside daughter Lottie, , and her husband. The family decided to go on the trip, from their home in Gloucestershire, after Sebastian had four operations within twelve months. But Joanna says they were not warned beforehand that he could not access many of the rides. And the family-of-four avoided the policy for the rest of the trip by ditching the wheelchair before queueing and carrying Sebastian instead. She said: We just thought him and his sister needed a treat. I told staff that he was disabled when I phoned up and booked and they told me how to get a pass, which included me sending a letter from the government about his disability.

The immortal “I don’t believe it!” uttered by actor Richard Wilson in the hit sit-com saw off meerkat Aleksandr Orlov’s “Simples” from the Compare the Market ad. Dad’s Army classic “Don’t panic” made famous by Lance-Corporal Jones, played by Clive Dunn was the third best loved. And Del Boy’smuch mimicked “Lovely jubbly” and “Rodney, you plonker!” from Only Fools and Horses both made the top .    The study found more than half of adults think the best expressions come from TV shows with one in five saying reality TV had the most popular catchphrases. According to the King’s College London study, on average Brits use a catchphrase three times a day and three in ten admit to peppering their conversations with well known phrases from their favourite shows. Experts say the perfect catchphrase is four words long, has to be heard at least four times to register in the brain and must be easy to repeat as well as funny.  The survey of , adults found a third of people use a popular phrase without knowing its origin with the pub the most likely place to drop it into general chit-chat. Tony Thorne, language consultant at King’s College university, said: “Catchphrases are a key component of popular culture as they connect the world of entertainment and consumption with the everyday concerns of real people - their feelings and experiences, their shared pleasures and their struggles and frustrations, and especially their triumphs over adversity. “Catchphrases derive their power from compressing complex ideas into short, snappy sequences.  “A catchphrase such as ‘I don’t believe it!’ expresses a mix of exasperation, world-weary resignation and fatalistic humour that will be familiar from many people’s personal experience.” The poll put “It is what it is” made famous by Love Island’s Sher Lanre, , just outside the top  at number  while The Daleks’ “Exterminate!” in Dr Who was at number  and comedian Micky Flanagan’s “We’re going out-out” made . .

The Loose Women star and the former Sky News paper reviewer revealed themselves at their most vulnerable in a bid to demonstrate to others suffering in silence that it really is OK not to be OK. Soundbites and campaigning on the issue are one thing. It is quite another to reveal the naked truth about just how weakened, dismantled and utterly defeated you are left feeling on a day to day basis. “How I describe it is the colour goes out of my le and people I am around that I love being with I don’t want to be around,” said Welch. Fty-year-old comedian Royce – a former warm-up man for The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent – is fighting to overcome alcohol addiction. He suffered a brain aneurysm when drunk and at one time attempted suicide. “My name is Ian and I’m an alcoholic…holding my hands up… for help. There I said it and own it,” he posted on Twitter.

A large crowd of screaming women were there to meet the -year-old, who was wearing a £ dress from Banana Republic. The Duchess visited the university which is part of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, an organisation that promotes international academic collaboration and which Meghan became a patron of in January this year.  She was met by Susana Glavan, director of the British Council, on her arrival. Professor Tshilidzi Marwala, vice chancellor of the University and Dr Joanna Newman, secretary general of the ACU, then welcomed Her Royal Highness to the institute.  Samukelisiwa Nomusa Shongwe was one of the students who gave Meghan a noisy welcome when she arrived at the university.I think she is a great person, she said. She has done so many things. She has contributed to society, especially to African society.She is very interested in playing a positive role by speaking about gender equality and gender abuse.

Yesterday she was spotted making a solo trip to Johannesburgaposs Victoria Yard - a popular arts and craft venue.

The girl-on-girl fracas happened on a train carrying revellers home from Newbury racecourse where they had been dancing and drinking. Today -year-old actress and dancer Eliza Peereboom sat in the dock accused of savagely biting a woman stranger above the knee so badly she has been left permanently scarred and needed three months of Tetanus injections. Peereboom, who lives in London, became involved in a fracas on the station  at Newbury, Berks., but physically beat other women who were in high spirits while travelling on the train to Reading, the court was told. The actress, who denies pulling the hair of racegoers Ciara Jones  and Nicole Deadfield and causing actual bodily harm to Gabriella Marabet, watched as a jury was shown  minutes of CCTV train footage from August  last year when the incident happened.  Prosecutor Emily Lauchlan opened the case saying: Everyone involved had been making their way home from Newbury racecourse. The defendant was with a friend. Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield were sat together waiting for the train when they accidentally bumped into the defendant who started shouting at aposdo not f***ing bump into meapos, said the prosecutor. Ms Lauchlan said that the victim had told the defendant to leave the problem on the  as they all made their way onto the train and the train ride was ultimately fine until the point when the train pulled into Reading station. As Ms Jones stood up she felt her hair pulled with enough force to pull her into a seat. As people tried to get the defendant off her, the other victim had her hair pulled and received an injury to her ankle, the jury at Reading Crown Court was told. Counts one and two of the indictment are ultimately hair pulling and bruising to the ankle, the prosecutor added. Judge Sarah Campbell then invited witness Gabriella Marabet, who was the person bitten, to take the witness stand. The jury heard that the -year-old victim now works at an estate agency but was studying business management and communications at university when the attack happened. Giving evidence she said: I had drunk around a bottle of Prosecco and three gin and tonics at the Newbury races with my family and friends but I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford. I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair. I kicked out and my leg was grabbed by the same girl who had my hair. I was bitten just above the knee which felt like for ages but it was about  seconds long. I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.  The jury of nine women and three men was shown body-worn camera police footage of Ms Marabet and her family and friends on the  shouting and causing a commotion after the incident. Ms Marabet said: I was furious, I was shouting that I had been bitten but I did not feel that it was dealt with accordingly by police officers at the time. When asked by defence counsel Kate Parker whether this commotion was the act of a sober person, the victim defended her actions blaming her anger and emotion on being upset that police treated her and her party as the culprit despite telling them she was the victim.Ms Lauchlan said: Ultimately, Gabriella Marabet was put in handcuffs and so was her step-brother and her party was warned they might be arrested. However, they were just detained until they calmed down.

Lily-Fay Parfitt was left screaming in agony with le-changing wounds to her cheek and lip when the dog attacked without warning as she played on her auntaposs farm earlier this month. Mum Kelly Parfitt claims surgeons ranked the nine-year-oldaposs injuries as a . out of  on an injury severity scale.

Lily-Fay will be scarred for le her mum said, with her two younger brothers who witnessed the attack left traumatised by the incident and terried of unfamiliar dogs.    Mum-of-five Kelly is warning people that all dog breeds can be dangerous and to keep pets on short leads around children. Kelly, from Southwater in West Sussex, said: Itaposs le changing for Lily, she canapost smile as sheaposs lost her lips. What I can see of her lip at the moment is that itaposs really jagged, like a jigsaw piece. Weaposve taken all mirrors down and covered the one in the bathroom up so she canapost see her reflection.    I think sheaposs going to be shocked because sheaposs very into photos and selfies. I feel like Iaposm in a daze, itaposs like Iaposm in a dream. I think Iaposll wake up and it will be a bad nightmare but clearly itaposs not going to happen. Itaposs still so raw.

Itaposs all covered up so she canapost see it. Whencomes off is when itaposs going to seem real to her.    Kelly was supervising Lily-Fay while she played with her cousins and siblings after school on her auntaposs farm in Pulborough, West Sussex. Full-time carer Kelly noticed a dog owner had left their pet tied up. The dog made a beeline for Lily-Fay and launched an unprovoked on the girl, Kelly claimed, biting her mouth and cheek. Kelly said: Lily saw the dog and stopped and turned, she didnapost even step towards the dog.    Lily didnapost even make a beeline and go running towards it, she stopped in her tracks and turned towards the dog - we werenapost that far away. The dog actually came straight to her. I heard an ear-piercing scream as it grabbed her top lip and tore out her cheek, leaving catastrophic wounds. My mum got to her before I did because I had her baby brother in my arms, she told me aposdonapost come nearapos and pushed me away. The injuries to Lilyaposs face is something that I never want to see again. Her top jaw, her top teeth, her tongue and bottom jaw had been degloved.    Lily-Fay had  stitches on the outside of her cheek to hold it together,  stitches in her lip and an unknown number inside her cheek. The dog took off so much skin that the young girl lost  percent of her top lip. Surgeons were concerned that stitching her up too tightly may leave her mouth drooping. It was the th time Lily-Fay has been under the kne, because she was born with a rare birth defect whcih means she has a horseshoe-shaped kidney and just  percent of her bowel. Despite now facing three weeks off school to prevent infection, the youngster is determined to keep up with her school work and Kelly claims she even managed to smile again last week. Kelly said: The surgeon took one look at her and said apositaposs le changing, we donapost knowshe will get senses back because of the severity of the injuryapos.    She has slight hearing loss out of her ear which we donapost knowit is going to come back. She canapost close her eye fully at night time, so theyaposre going to put eye drops in to stop her eye from drying out. Sheaposs already had so much going on in her little le as it is, sheaposs doing really well. The incident was reported to Sussex Police and Kelly claims the dog has since been put to sleep.

Mandy realised the meal plan could easily be adapted to suit family le and she could eat everything from pizza, roast dinners, curry and even chicken nuggets and chips.    With the hundreds of free foods available it really can be adapted to any lestyle, the diabetes research nurse said. It really is so easy to follow as itaposs not a diet it is a well balanced healthy eating plan that encourages long term intrinsic lestyle changes. The best bit about Slimming World is nothing is banned. If I want to enjoy an ice cream on my day out with my little boy then I can. Slowly I kept swapping my food choices and increasing my physical activity and before I knew it I had easily embraced a whole new lestyle. My confidence was slowly building and I went from wanting to hide behind baggy clothes and  smiles to genuine happiness and clothes that showed off my new forming figure.    Mandy, who now weighs . stone, had struggled with her size since childhood. I was a chubby child and on the larger side as a teenager, she told Okehampton Times . As an emotional eater food has literally been my crutch and one that I have relied on heavily. As a teenager, I was subjected to bullying because of my weight and this only served to fuel my emotional eating and the weight slowly kept creeping on. Despite trying everything from hypnotherapy to diet pills, and milkshakes to restrictive diet plans, the mum found it tough to tackle the flab. She also had a setback when her husband was diagnosed with incurable kidney cancer. He was forced to have surgery to have his kidney removed, along with a separate operation for a hernia repair. And despite the pain of seeing her husband going through such a horric ordeal, her group managed to keep her on track with her diet.

Have a purpose in le The Japanese philosophy of ikigai roughly translates as “the reason you get up in the morning” and could add seven good years to your le, says explorer, author and longevity expert Dan Buettner.He adds: “Science has linked having a purposeful le with longer le ­expectancy, better sleep and lower rates of chronic illness. One of the most dangerous years of your le is the year you retire because you experience a sudden lack of purpose.” Have regular hot baths As well as helping to relax muscles, a Japanese study by Ehime University in Matsuyama found that regular hot baths are linked to better heart and circulatory health.Those who took at least five a week had lower markers of atherosclerosis . Eat like an Italian The Mediterranean diet is great for heart health, reduces the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer, and is ideal for sustainable fat burning and lean muscle gain, say scientists at Sheffield Hallam University. This diet always wins praise from nutritionists.  Stay close to family and friends In Okinawa, a Japanese island known as “land of the immortals” due to the number of centenarians, residents set up friendship groups known as ‘moai’. The term means ‘meeting for a common purpose’ and originated as a way for villagers to support each other in times of need,” explains Dan Buettner. Studies consistently show that social ­isolation is associated with several chronic health conditions. Get outside every day Even with the increased risk of skin cancer, those who enjoy the sun are less likely to die young than shade-seekers, say Swedish researchers who monitored , women over two decades. Good levels of vitamin D – triggered by sunshine – protect against diabetes, osteoporosis and other conditions. Walk briskly A fast walking pace is linked with a longer le regardless of a person’s weight, according to data analysis of nearly half a million Brits.Professor Tom Yates of University of Leicester, lead author of the study, said: “Perhaps physical fitness is a better indicator of le expectancy than body mass index , and that encouraging the population to engage in brisk walking may add years to their lives.” Make any journey less than a mile on foot Lack of exercise kills twice as many people as obesity, a Cambridge University study of , people found. Adding  minutes of walking into your daily routine five days a week can add three and a half years to your lespan. Put full-fat milk on cereal Researchers from Canada’s McMaster University looked at the diets of , adults over nine years and found those who consumed an average of . servings of full-fat dairy a day had the lowest rates of mortality cardiovascular disease and stroke.  A glass of full-fat milk, a teaspoon of butter or g of cheese equals one serving. Eat an apple a day... ...and some broccoli, a handful of blueberries, an orange – and drink a cup of tea. This combination provides a good range of flavonoids, which are naturally-occurring health-protecting compounds, say Australian researchers.  Be optimistic Positive people are more likely to live long, found a study analysing , women in a nurses’ health study and , men in a veterans’ health study. On average, the most optimistic men and women had an  to % longer lespan, and were more likely to live to at least  compared with the least optimistic group. The theory is that optimists suffer less stress. Book a break Taking regular holidays from work could prolong le, according to a -year study published in The Journal of Nutrition, Health  Aging. Professor Timo Strandberg, the study’s lead author at the University of Helsinki, said: “Don’t think having an otherwise healthy lestyle will compensate for working too hard and not taking holidays. Vacations can be a good way to relieve stress.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teen finds car after week","story":"NewsTeen finds car after a week despite having no idea where he parked it at festivalConnor Spear, , has finally been able to track down his Vauxhall Corsa after a Good Samaritan sent pictures of where it was parkedShareCommentsByDaniel Chipperfield:,  OCT NewsConnor will soon get his black Vauxhall Corsa back \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources.

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The centre was inspired by Catherine and her husband John after their experiences when John contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome.#I thought the notion of collecting crisp packets was brilliant, said Catherine, so I mentioned it to Michael one day.##Catherine suggested the crisp packet idea to me one day when I was in the Salty Dog Cafe,# explained Michael.After discussing it with teachers it was all systems go. Head girl Eilidh Logan designed snazzy posters to go around the school and the bags poured in.Michael concluded: #Collecting crisp bags is just so easy to do, and we are supporting recycling, prevention of littering and charity benefits too.#If you want to donate crisp bags, there are a number of collection points around Mid Argyll. Aside from Lochgilphead High School, you could hand them in to Mid Argyll Community Pool, Mid Argyll Sports Centre, Argyll Insurance in Lochgilphead, the MS and Dochas centres, Lochgilphead Community Centre and the Tayvallich Inn."},{"url":null,"title":"first round blow for depleted star","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star travelled to Barrhead last Saturdayto play Newlands in the West of Scotland Cup.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position.

funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"farmer told to be of good behaviour","story":"Fergus Wilkie, , of Crossibeg Farm, had previously admitted engaging in behaviour which caused a woman fear and alarm by loitering and following her outside her place of work and in a supermarket.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots.

One came earlier this month when he was flown to New York and, suited and booted, invited to walk the red carpet at the star-studded US premiere of the film version of Downton Abbey, everyonersquos favourite Edwardian upstairs downstairs romp.ldquoIt was spectacular, he says, still sounding a little awestruck. ldquoThey had a fantastic party afterwards in the Plaza Hotel, opposite Central Park. I still do pinch myself a little bit, I have to say.Lunnrsquos compositions have been a staple of Downton Abbey since it first aired in . He has scored each of its six series as well as the film version, which is set in  and finds the Crawley family entertaining King George V and his we Queen Mary. It was for his work on the blockbuster series that he won the two Emmys, the first in in , the second the following year. It also brought him a Royal Television Award for Best Score though in its way the accolade bestowed on him by Classic FM is perhaps most telling of the lot: in a  listenersrsquo poll of the best TV theme ever written, Lunnrsquos Downton Abbey Theme came top.Looking back, Lunn admits to being ldquoquite surprised at how well liked Downton Abbey was when the first series aired .ldquoI thought it would do well because the production values really were pretty high, it looked good, there was some great acting and it was well written, he says. ldquoBut like everybody  I was a bit surprised that the subject material would prove to be so popular. Irsquod done things like Little Dorrit [] and Bleak House [], Dickens adaptations which were enormously successful here and in America, and I thoughtit does as well as either of them, thatrsquoll be great. Irsquoll be perfectly happy with that. Little did I know it would eclipse both of them by some distance.But while nobody now doubts the power of the series on the small screen, it still wasnrsquot a given that it would translate well to the multiplex.ldquoWhat everybody was concerned about was whether we could motivate an audience who was used to seeing it on a Sunday evening to go to the cinema, says Lunn. ldquoBut amazingly, that seems to have happened.And how. When the film was released in the US it beat both Brad Pittrsquos Ad Astra and Sylvester Stallonersquos Rambo: Last Blood to top the box office, taking  millionin its opening weekend and setting a new record for what industry bible Variety terms a ldquospecialty studio . The reviews werenrsquot bad either.Lunn has lived most of his adult le in London but he was born in Glasgow in , grew up in Bridge of Allan from the age of five and attended Stirling High School. Although born to musical parents ndash his father had played in a jazz band in the s ndash he came late to playing music himself.ldquoBecause my father had been a sax player there was a lot of music in the house. At the age of  or  I was kind of absorbing it all and I got into a lot of the rock music that was around then, like Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix. My dad suggested I take up an instrument and I heard Paul Tortelier playing the cello on the television and thought lsquoThat sounds quite interestingrsquo.He asked at school and was told there was no chance of cello lessons, buthe wanted he could try the double bass instead. He decided to give it a shot. He was  at the time, quite old to be taking up an instrument.ldquoAs soon as I started I just knew. I got really good at it really quickly. I took up piano lessons about six months later and after that nobody could stop me. Nobody had to tell me to practice.ldquoTo be honest, I think I was a bit unhappy before that. Those early years at secondary school are quite dficult and I didnrsquot quite know where I fitted in. I was scrabbling around looking for something to hold on to and music provided that in abundance. I just went with it.His next move, then, was a no-brainer: Glasgow University where, aged , he studied music and threw himself and his double bass into the cityrsquos music scene. At one point he played in a band with Craig Armstrong, now also a noted composer of film scores.In  Lunn was offered a publishing contract with Chrysalis Records and moved to London. He has lived in the city ever since. For a few years he became, as he puts it, ldquoa bit involved in pop music but his preferred outlet was a series of bands he describes as ldquoexperimental. The most notable was Man Jumping, an electro-jazz fusion group signed to EG Records, also home to Brian Eno, Robert Fripp and Penguin Cafeacute Orchestra.He wrote his first score for television in , for a BBC play called The Gt, and throughout the early s he continued to write for long-forgotten series such as Backup and The Ghostbusters Of East Finchley. Then, in , came his big break: Hamish Macbeth, an amiable BBC drama following the le of a policeman in rural Scotland.Filmed in Plockton, it ran to three series and proved an unlikely hit. Lunn wasnrsquot the only one involved who moved on to bigger and better things. Robert Carlyle had the title role andyou scan through the credits yoursquoll also find Shirley Henderson and Alastair Mackenzie as well as Skins creator Bryan Elsley and Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle, in a rare writing role.Today, Lunn isnrsquot the only working composer with the Midas touch. But since that first major commission his CV has been peppered with landmark productions, many of them period pieces. There was The White Queen, nominated for a Golden Globe in . There was Bleak House, nominated for  Emmy Awards and winner of the Best Drama Serial award at the  BAFTAs. There was Burton And Taylor, which starred Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter as the starring battling couple and which picked up a clutch of award nominations on both sides of the Atlantic. There have been many others.With his own Emmy wins and the higher profile they brought, Lunn would have been well placed to make the move to the US. Was he ever tempted  He had plenty offers, he says, but he turned them down.ldquoIt was a dficult period for me to have gone over to America because both my kids were in secondary school and they were quite happy where they were. I was getting plenty of work here and anyway six months of the year was taken up doing Downton.It hasnrsquot proved to be a mistake. Among Lunnrsquos recent compositions are the soundtracks for BBC Scotlandrsquos police series Shetland Sky Onersquos historical drama Jamestown, set in  in the American colony of the same name and, for Netflix, The Last Kingdom, an adaptation of Bernard Cornwellrsquos Saxon Stories, set in England in the Dark Ages.Hersquos particularly proud of the last one, a collaboration with genre-spanning Faroese singer Eivoslashr Paacutelsdoacutettir, also known for her work with composer Gavin Bryars.ldquoI think what wersquove done for The Last Kingdom is possibly about the most original thing Irsquove done, he says. A long way from the Downton Abbey soundtrack, which he describes as being ldquolike a combination of Coldplay and Philip Glass, it relies almost entirely on his studiorsquos battery of analogue synthesisers, though there is one other element: for the first time, he has found a use for that gong.Downton Abbey: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is out now Best trait  Irsquom fairly calm, even in a crisis.Worst trait  Yoursquod have to ask my we, but possibly some level of hypocrisy!Last book read  The Road To Wigan Pier by George OrwellLast film watched  Irsquove just finished Chernobyl and I thought it was brilliant.Whorsquos in your fantasy rock group and what do you play  Itrsquos not exactly rock but Irsquod have loved to have been Miles Davisrsquos bass player between  and  playing alongside the likes of Keith Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Herbie Hancock, John McLaughlin etc.Best advice received  Study at Glasgow University, given to me by my head of music at Stirling High School, Mr. Melville.Ideal dinner party guests  Nicola Sturgeon, Billy Connolly and Brian Eno"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Traitor  Liar  The Commons is becoming more like Twitter than Twitter","story":"Some pundits were saying that this unrestrained, aggressive style of political debate began with the  Scottish referendum. But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow. Its time."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10472529.jpg?type=article-full","title":"relax-unwind-one-fantastic-spas-scotland","story":"Whether youre looking to treatyourself and a friend or are looking forgt ideas for Christmas, there are a wealthof fantastic spas in Scotland to choose from.

It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-maciver-politicians-must-learn-act-normally-like-rest-us","story":"I voted Remain, in part, because I feared this. I feared that a small but influential smattering of my fellow Remainers would not accept the result. And I feared that a small but influential smattering of nationalist Brexiters would pursue a Brexit which would have worked for the British Empire but wonrsquot for UK plc.After last weekrsquos debilitating performances in the House of Commons, the received wisdom is that the fault for all of this lies squarely with one side indeed, with one man, Boris Johnson. Johnsonrsquos charge sheet is indeed extensive, and his looseness with language has a long history. His comparison of Muslim women wearing the Niqab to letter boxes and bank robbers was enabling language which one could easily imagine being transferred to the street. Equating the EUrsquos drive towards further political integration to the empire-building of Hitler and Napoleon was, as well as offensive to those who live with the memory of Hitlerrsquos consequences, not the way to win friends and influence the other side in an impending negotiation.And, last week, when an emotional Paula Sherrf, citing Jo Cox, said that Johnsonrsquos chosen language of surrender, betrayal and traitor features in the abuse and death threats directed at Remain MPs, Johnson replied ldquoI have never heard such humbug in all my le. I watched this live, and gulped. It was a dismal, dismissive way to reply to a question of that substance and tone.Boris Johnson is the Prime Minister. What he says and how he says it matter a great deal. He must hold himself to a higher standard, ensuring that the consequences which his words have are positive and not negative that they heal wounds rather than reopening them.Although leaks from the  Committee meeting of backbench MPs indicated that he showed some contrition, his fellow MPs and the country as a whole would have benefited immeasurably from him doing so in public. It would have cost him very little to say sorry to Paula Sherrf, to say that he made a mistake, to say that he adopted the wrong tone in that answer. That he chose not to has made us all a little poorer.However I must say - and I say this in particular to my fellow Remainers - you are throwing stone after stone after stone through the windows of your glass houses. For your charge sheet is also long as extensive as that of your Leave opponents.Because for every Leave MP we find speaking at a rally calling Remainers traitors, we have David Lammy MP comparing the Conservative European Research Group to Hitler, a man who killed six million Jews. And for every Leave MP we have calling Hilary Bennrsquos Brexit-delaying legislation the Surrender Act, we have Ed Davey MP calling Boris Johnson a dictator, which in the lexicon of most normal people would place him in a bracket with Stalin, Pol Pot, Mugabe or Castro. And for every Brexit-supporting newspaper calling Remain MPs saboteurs, we have Remain-supporting newspapers accusing the Government of a coup, which we are presumably to believe is on par with the Sudanese Armyrsquos removal of Omar al-Bashir earlier this year.Can we see ourselves  Can we see how emaciating this is  Can David Lammy see that, unlike Hitler, MPs in the ERG are not genocidal  Can Ed Davey see that, unlike Hugo Chavez, Boris Johnson is not jailing journalists and choosing his own political opponents  If they cannot, then they belong in a dark corner of the internet, not in our Parliament.This propensity to lose all ability to be reasonable and rational is infecting more of my fellow Remainers than I had thought possible. I have always enjoyed watching Jess Phillips on television. Shersquos so raw, so real, so relevant in todayrsquos politics. But last week, referring to the \"humbug\" remark of which I wrote earlier, Phillips said very directly that Johnson referred to Jo Coxrsquos murder as humbug. He did not this was a quite deliberate and improper insinuation, ironically during Phillipsrsquo own Urgent Question about the consequences of language in politics. Again, I watched this exchange live, and felt myself deflating. Phillips instantly went from being part of the solution to being part of the problem.The Speaker, John Bercow, was reasonable and even-handed in his remarks last week, when he said that fault lay on both sides. He was right. But the trouble with many of my fellow Remainers is that they simply donrsquot agree. They carry with them a moral superiority which guides them into the unshakeable belief that we are right and they are wrong. That itrsquos okay for us to call Johnson a dictator but itrsquos not okay for him to accuse us of betrayal, because wersquore the good guys and hersquos the bad guy. The ultimate irony is that, in the final analysis, this moral superiority played a key role in the disconnection between the political classes and the people, and the subsequent loss of the  referendum.We now must hit the reset button. In my view, this is more about the deliberate attribution of inaccurate thoughts or actions to opponents than it is about language itself. The language itself is primarily spin. For instance, claiming that the Benn Act is a \"surrender\" is deliberately emotive, but little dferent to claiming that a \"hard\" Brexit is a \"clf edge\", also deliberately emotive terms designed to make you think the other option must be better.Instead, at least as a first step, I would like to see the deliberate and  attribution cease. When Boris Johnson claims that everyone who fails to support leaving the EU come-what-may on st October all want to Remain, that is as deliberate and  an attribution to them as Jess Phillipsrsquo \"humbug\" attribution is to him.Neither side can pat themselves on the back today. Neither side should be going to bed sleeping soundly in the belief that they can hold their heads high. I could count on my hands the number of MPs who I could honestly say have the right to do that.It sounds hard even unachievable. But it really is not. All they have to do is act normally.

Word had reached the highest level that there was \"a person with views\" in S. As I walked down a pitch black, -metre-long corridor, I remained steadfastly sure that my wide-ranging research , and in-depth questioningwould see me through this momentary hiccup in creating this seemingly seditious pamphlet .But, in the four minutes it took for the red traffic light at the end of the tunnel of doom, to turn to green, and the Heidiersquos voice to boom ldquoCome!, I wobbled. Yes itrsquos true! I was indeed a dirty socialist interloper sent from a s housing estate state primary school to this small, all-girl, private school to undermine it and ultimately bring about its collapse.When it came to thinking about schools for my own children, surprisingly the simplicity of my survey did not help. I talked to other parents. One friend, who I visited on a sunny April morning at her and her husbandrsquos six-bedroom house, complete with a Porsche  gleaming in the driveway, told me that they were sending their children to the local state school because they felt school was not just about academics.ldquoItrsquos about learning le lessons, coming across a range of people, problems and lsquostuffrsquo so that real le doesnrsquot come as a massive surprise.But then there was another friend of mine in Perth who is an NHS worker. She stridently told me she would rather starve than not have sent her son to private school for the last  years. She herself had been a quiet child who had struggled in a large state primary school and fell behind, before being moved to our private school.ldquoThere were months mum couldnrsquot pay, but the school helped out. Yes, I was at school with girls who had race horses in the front garden, but I didnrsquot feel any dferent.She found it hard to catch up with her reading and writing. ldquoI didnrsquot want that for my son, who was quite introverted as well. It had been exceptionally hard for her to pay the fees for his school. She paused before adding ldquoRemember all those times I couldnrsquot come to Glasgow to see you girls  Well that was because I didnrsquot have the money to put petrol in the car.I could see a little of what my friend was so passionate about: I really admired the seemingly over-arching confidence of the girls I had been at school with. I craved that confidence for my children. We were a purposeful, articulate and loyal bunch. We stretched our wings in the sciences, creative writing and Latin.We were surprisingly erse too - from the children of the inherited rich to the daughters of the just-recently-got rich. From the off-spring of immigrants whorsquod arrived with a fiver in their pockets to the few girls who faced abuse walking through some of Glasgowrsquos poorer areas to get to the school, we were quite a motley crew.As a Muslim, I was proud to inform my parents that my best friends were a Jew and a Christian. We confidently asserted ourselves, and expressed our ideas freely, perhaps without fear of what any boys in the class might think of us. Most,not all, of us assumed we would go to university or college and then onto work.But I often wonderedour confidence was a bit like our school unorm, and indeed our accents - something we put on, to homogenise us, to make us a type, maybe to cover up or compensate for any wee shortcomings we might have had.We were also utterly terried of the kids from the local state school. They sat on a wall nonchalantly eating chips as we walked by, but we actually thought they wanted to kill us - a perfect example of how a lack of contact, breeds fear. It floors me to think that,  years later, a close friend and colleague, Kate, who I cannot even contemplate starting a work project without, was one of those chip-eating lsquoterrorsrsquo.I knew that sort of insularity and lack of, as I saw it, iniduality was not what I wanted for my own children.Ultimately, both had six years at state school, having encountered young people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and abilities, accents and sensibilities.I watch them in their workplaces interact with customers with an ease I could have only dreamt of. They describe nights out that involve skillful de-escalations of potentially dficult situations with groups of other young men in the street.They are quietly confident but always attuned to the group dynamic. Most importantly I value their iniduality, and their determination to go against the flow or fashion. They may not have particular loyalties to their old school tie, but perhaps thats not a bad thing."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-offer-new-brexit-plan-brussels","story":"The UK will offer Brussels a revised Brexit deal by the end of the week as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ramps up efforts to strike an agreement.It is understood the legal text of a Brexit plan will be sent to Brussels after the Tory conference concludes on Wednesday.The move comes as Irish broadcaster RTE reported the UK had put forward the idea ofcustom clearance centres being set up five to ten miles either side of the Irish border.:Opposition leaders plot to stop Boris Johnsons no-deal Brexit planHowever, Government sources distanced themselves from parts of the reports.The reported plans by the British Government to create customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop were dismissed by Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney.The idea for the customs posts are contained in the so-called lsquonon-papersrsquo submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions.Mr Coveney poured cold water on the plans, saying Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ldquodeserves better.:Scottish court bid to ensure Boris Johnson \"obeys law\" over Brexit to startHe tweeted: ldquoNon-Paper  Non-Starter.

We have made some pretty big moves, we are waiting to see whether our European friends will help us and whether we can find the right landing zone.ldquoBut whatever happens, wersquoll come out on October .Other reports said he UK was ready to suggest the creation of an all-Ireland economic zone allowing agricultural and food products to move between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic without checks at the border.And The Times claimed Mr Johnson wanted the EU to rule out any further Brexit extension as he moved to present a new Brexit arrangement.Chancellor Sajid Javid said he thinks he knows how the Prime Minister intends to achieve the October  withdrawal despite the restrictions of the Benn Act.The law was rushed through Parliament to require the Prime Minister to seek a delay to Brexita deal has not been agreed by October , orMPs have not agreed to leave the EU without one.But there have been suspicions in pro-EU circles that the Prime Minister will try to avoid complying with the requirements.The Chancellor told the BBC: ldquoOf course, every government should observe all laws at all times. Wersquore taking a careful look at that law.He said there could be no more ldquodither and delayand we will leavewe have to without a deal on October .ldquoThe intention of the law is clear and I do think it has absolutely made it harder for the Government to get the deal that we all want to see. That said, it can still be done.ldquoItrsquos not about getting around the law. I donrsquot really want to discuss the detail of this law, itrsquos a pretty fresh new law, but we are also clear at all times we, of course, like any government, we will absolutely observe the law.The Chancellor said he was not sure how much a no-deal Brexit would cost the economy in the short term.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone really knows a full, proper answer to that question. And I have never pretended thatyou leave without a deal it wonrsquot be challenging.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly heavily hinted the Government believed there was a way of wriggling out of the Benn Act.He told a Politico fringe event in Manchester on Monday evening: ldquoLegislation passed in a rush tends to be bad legislation.He refused to say how the Government could get around the legislation, adding: ldquoWhat wersquove seen is parties distorting the parliamentary process, breaking conventions, taking a very creative interpretation of parliamentary procedures to prevent the Government discharging a promise the Prime Minister made and indeed a promise that all parties made at the referendum.ldquoAnd Irsquom not going to help them by showing them our homework."},{"url":null,"title":"gruffalo-stamps-released-mark-books-20th-anniversary","story":"The Gruffalo,written by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler, has sold more than . million copies worldwide and it has been translated into more than  languages since it was released in .The first six stamps follow the original story of Mouse, who travels through a wood meeting other animals, scaring them off with tales of his lsquoimaginaryrsquo friend ndash the fearsome Gruffalo.The final four stamps are featured in a brand new illustration that Scheffler was commissioned to create by the Royal Mail.:Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson in a bit of a tight squeak for her showIt shows the Gruffalo alongside four other characters: Owl, Snake and Fox, who react in alarm to the creature, and Mouse, who smiles knowingly.The stamps will be available on general sale at , Post Offices across the UK from October .Interested in reading  Join the Herald Book Club on FacebookDaryl Shute, The Gruffalo brand director for production company Magic Light, said: ldquoIn working with the Royal Mail to release a set of beautul stamps, we feel that the much-loved Gruffalo has really been commemorated in this special year.:Julia Donaldson makes libraries plea as The Gruffalo creator honoured with CBEThe Gruffalo has won numerous awards including the UKrsquos best-selling picture book in , and the Blue Peter Best Book To Read Aloud award.It was voted the Best Bedtime Story in a BBC poll in .The story has also been adapted into a West End theatre production and an Oscar-nominated animated film.Philip Parker, from the Royal Mail, said: ldquoWe celebrate  years of The Gruffalo with these charming stamps, and are delighted that Axel has taken us back to the deep, dark wood with his new illustrations of the much-loved characters.A full set of all  stamps, which is available in a special presentation pack including a Gruffalo snakes and ladders game, will go on sale at pound.."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10485891.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-gift-good-money-management-top-financial-adviser-max-horne","story":"WITH new statistics revealing that UK - year olds are the most in debt they have ever been, particularly for phone debt, and with the average age of a first time homeowner with a mortgage rising to , itrsquos clear that young people today are lacking in good money instruction.With this in mind, Max Horne, one of the countryrsquos top Financial Advisors, has turned first time author, and is on what he sees as a very important mission to help young adults become better prepared in handling money for their futures.ldquoThe Money Instruction Book has Maxrsquos forty years of money wisdom and experience built in, to create an easy to digest guide to money management for - year old homeleavers.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NHS Lanarkshire treated  people and NHS Ayrshire , both four-year highs.More recently, this month a woman was attacked by a dog while walking her border terrier on a cycle path in Dumfries, suffering leg and hand injuries, while in August there were at least three fatal dog-on-dog attacks in Scotland.: Scottish government to review dog control act days after English woman mauled to death​: Scottish government backs harsher punishment for animal cruelty Demands for tougher dog control laws, including making children’s play parks safer from out-of-control animals, will be made by MSPs, even though a review of legislation is already under way.Chair of the committee Labour MSP Jenny Marra, said she welcomed the government’s reviews but added: “Barely a week goes by without reports of yet another tragic incident. The government needs to treat this issue with the high priority it deserves.”She added: “We heard evidence from victims and witnesses of dog attacks and concluded that there’s still an unacceptable level of attacks.“Our report called for the urgent reform of current dog control legislation so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with effectively.“It is also vital that immediate action is taken to improve enforcement of the existing powers which might help prevent attacks.”Improving the effectiveness of the lawThe committee has called for the immediate establishment of a “Scottish dog control database” to improve the effectiveness of the law GPs, hospitals, local authorities and Police Scotland to be required to record and collect consistent data on reported incidences and councils to use their powers to create secure play areas for children in parks from which dogs are banned.MSPs will debate the committee’s recommendations, with the Scottish Government likely to point to a new consultation it has opened on possible law changes including the power to seize dogs and hold them while applications to put them down are considered, a national database of dog control notices and the creation of a criminal offence for breaching them.Ms Marra added: “It has become clear that current dog control law doesn’t work. It needs reform urgently so that out-of-control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs.”Ash Denham, Scotland’s community safety minister has previously pledged to protect people from dogs not kept under control by their owners and said the government is “absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-control dogs”.Ms Denham said the current consultation would seek views on improvements on how the Control of Dogs Act  can operate, and a second review will begin next year to take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed. She said: “Owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation.” The consultation runs until January .©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why it s wrong to laugh at ken stott and his fellow luvvies aidan smith","story":"Amid the dference of opinion between author Ian Rankin and actor Ken Stott over whether fictional detective John Rebus would support Scottish independence or the Union, Aidan Smith wondersit#s time to give an actor the keys to power.I’ve always liked Ken Stott. He’s a fine actor, obviously, but we also have a couple of things in common. We share the same dentist, or at least shared, back in boyhood in Edinburgh, when surgeries were grim places, waiting-rooms contained not a single dog-eared copy of the Beano, and memories of the brown rubber mask jammed over your mouth just before the knockout gas took effect could still evoke a shudder half a century later. We were struggling to remember his name until I mentioned the mask. “That was it – Mr Brown,” said Stott, holding his jaw in mock pain. “And he just loved pulling teeth.”The other thing we have in common is that we’ve both pretended to follow the rival capital football team from the one we support – me for a book and Stott to play Ian Rankin’s detective John Rebus on TV. Rankin wrote the character as a Hibs fan and Stott, a follower of Hearts, has just had to lump it and wear the scarf. Writer’s prerogative and all that.But this hasn’t stopped Stott wondering about Rebus’ politics. Indeed he’s done more than wonder, firing off a letter to Nicola Sturgeon insisting that the grumpy gumshoe is an indyreffer and not the No voter the author claims.: Why Rebus said sorry for wearing a Hibs scarf – Steve CardownieFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThis has been boiled up into a row. A “public war of words”, according to the report I read, with Stott apparently “incensed” by Rankin making the crabbit cop wear a metaphorical Unionist bunnet when almost everything about him points in the other direction.What a hoot. I don’t think anyone is incensed and am sure all the participants will be having a laugh about this, especially Stott, who some have felt the need to inform that Rebus isn’t actually a real person, that writers make stuff up, and that characters belong to them and not actors.You’re a luvvie!Er, I think he will know all of this. And I reckon the nub of the issue here is in the report’s headline which labels Stott a “luvvie”. You see, actors aren’t supposed to have views about anything beyond the film play telly programme they’re promoting. They’re not supposed to engage with the world. If they try and do this they’re ridiculed.That was just a performance! You read something right-on in theand you memorised it! You’re a bleeding-heart, look-at-me-I’m-wonderful, feel-the-warmth-of-my-sincerity, jump-on-any-cause, over-emoting git! You’re a luvvie!Am I about to say something in defence of Actors With Opinions  I think I might be. Goodness knows I’ve met plenty without. In a previous le I interviewed actors all the time. They’d talk about “the work” and nothing . They’d talk about their characters asthey were real people. They’d analyse their characters’ motivations like they were Sigmund bloody Freud. Then, exhausted and appalled and desperate to end this charade, I’d ask the plaintive final question that I knew to be hopeless: “So, what do you do when you’re not acting ” Always the reply would be: “Oh, I love going to the theatre and the cinema.” In other words, you watch other actors act. In other words, you’re just as insecure and neurotic as the rest, and just as much of an empty vessel as well.: Why Scotland must move on from independence referendum Sturgeon cannot call – Brian Wilson: Scottish independence: Scottish Tories rule out supporting ‘supermajority’ in second referendumSo when actors attempt to fill the vessel with notions, ideas, a bit of themselves, something which angers inspires them, anything apart from the bland pfle which forms the basis of most celebrity interviews, what do we do  We make fun of them.The actor knows he’s his own worst enemy. Martin Freeman, star of The Office, Sherlock and currently A Confession, is extremely nervous about members of his profession getting political. “It’s deeply annoying to have someone like me, who doesn’t know everything, bang on,” he says. “Actors can be pompous and we can overestimate our importance.”And Katherine Parkinson from The IT Crowd and right now Defending the Guilty says: “Actors who aren’t that informed going on about their politics make me cringe. It’s very easy to call yourself a feminist and often men that might say it the loudest are the first to stick their hand on someone who’s not their girlfriend’s knee.”Reagan dismissed genuine heroismSo what’s worse: an actor who talks about politics but is a groper ... or a prime minister, women on either side of him at lunch, who’s dubbed “the double thigh-squeezer”. Almost certainly the latter, but the actor who puts himself out there politically should be allowed to make the odd mistake and drop the occasional clanger. Yes, what they say can make them seem self-important and sanctimonious but surely that’s down to delivery they’re more accomplished at getting up and speaking than you or me .I’ve laughed at actors plenty. My favourite story about political actors concerns Ronald Reagan when he was trying to win a second term as US President and Democrat rival John Glenn, the former astronaut, received a boost in the polls from the film The Right Stuff about the true le adventures of the Mercury Seven rocketmen. Reagan dismissed Glenn as “just a celluloid hero” until it was pointed out to him that the latter had carried out all the daring portrayed in the movie.

It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands of scottish 78s come home","story":"He was a young long-haired jazz hound sporting a duffel coat, corduroy trousers and crepe-soled shoes, who turned his back on the Scottish music his family loved and performed at home.Now, decades later -year-old William Dean-Myatt, who eventually regained his love of Scottish song and dance music, has donated his massive collection of more than , records of a range of Scottish music genres to the National Library of Scotlandin Edinburgh for the nation’s national sound archive.Transportation of Mr Dean-Myatt’s collection, amassed over  years, and valued at around £,, involved NLS staff making two journeys to his home in Walsall in the West Midlands and battling torrential rain to bring the final section of the collection of s, cassettes and wax cylinders of music, north by van last week.: Naga Munchetty: BBC reverses complaint : Scottish rock greats Simple Minds to play Glasgow concert next yearMr Dean-Myatt, a retired businessman, whose paternal grandmother Jessie Bell Myatt, neé MacIsaac, was from Govan in Glasgow, said: “Although I grew up in England, as along as I can remember it was a Presbyterian household with Scottish country dancing, Burns ballads, Harry Lauder songs and my uncle playing the piano while we all gathered round and sang.

There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm. The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"as a family we have given wrightbus around 75 years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is further evidence of Tory recklessness and belligerence towards Ireland.”Irish Labour Party Leader Brendan Howlin also dismissed the plans.He tweeted: “Leaked proposals from the UK on alternatives to the backstop are completely unacceptable. The UK is well aware that a mass of new border checks, wherever sited, breach the agreement reached with the May government to avoid regulatory barriers to trade.”SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood said the reported proposals fall short of fulfilling the objective of the backstop.“The content of these proposals fails to meet the British Government’s obligations under the December  joint report to avoid physical infrastructure, checks and controls at the border. It doesn’t matterit’s a mile, five miles or ten miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable,” he said.Separately, the Irish Farmer’s Association President Joe Healy said the reported proposal by the UK to install custom clearance centres’ at both sides of the border is not a credible alternative to the backstop.“These customs clearance centres’ are border posts under a dferent name. The purpose of the backstop is to act as a fallback in the event that a future trade deal cannot address the NI Border issue to the UK and EU’s satisfaction. This latest proposal is an attempt to put lipstick on a pig. A customs post is a customs post, no matter what is called or where it’s located,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland house prices soar as rest of uk remains stagnant","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These guys like to get in the wrestling ring and try and tell a story.

They very politely said do you mind, were about to do our entrance.\"Usually I pride myself on being very professional but its the one time I had to get a selfie because I was their biggest fan growing up.\"Rich said he can never tell who will turn up at a show.He added: \"I was backstage in Madison Square Garden about a year ago for the WWE and The Undertaker was walking around before his entrance.\"So moments like that are really interesting.

The report was comprehensive and put forward a strong case.“I have given it full consideration over the last two months, as well as taking on board the views of many people I meet on a daily basis who dedicate their lives and careers to education and to nurturing the minds of young people.“My view is that our education system is responsive and progressive enough to allow for the Junior Cycle Framework to be structured in such a way for history to have a special core status.“I am seeking the support of the NCCA to examine how best that can be achieved and their expertise to design a special core status for history within the new Junior Cycle to meet the request.”Prior to the introduction of the reforms, history was a mandatory subject in approximately half of post-primary schools, although around nine out of  students across post-primary took the history examination at Junior Cycle.Currently, maths, English, Irish and wellbeing are the only mandatory subjects, with the other  being optional.Mr McHugh added: “The optional nature of history in the Junior Cycle Framework was due to be reviewed two years from now but I am not prepared to risk a fall in the number of students studying history in that time.“The Junior Cycle Framework focuses on core learning as opposed to core subjects.“It is my view, after long consideration, that history is central to that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan empowerment of women changes absolutely everything for communities","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class. In ,  children attended the school.The writing on the wall came when a proposed merger with nearby Annsborough Integrated Primary School to create a controlled integrated school was abandoned in the face of falling pupil numbers.In May the Education Authority issued a document in which it stated that Castlewellan Primary would close and Annsborough Integrated would be retained.The document said numbers at Castlewellan Primary had declined ldquoto a point where the potential establishment of a controlled integrated primary school was no longer viable.The closure will mark the end of controlled education in the town. Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years.

The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

After founding Cheshire’s Agricultural Chaplaincy Team, Keith began working with gay farmers and realised how many people across the country in the same situation must also be hiding their sexuality and consequently facing enormous pressures on their mental health and wellbeing. Since its launch, the ‘Gay Farmer Helpline’ has received new callers every week, and Keith’s work was featured in a documentary Landline, made in collaboration with BFI Flare, which showcased stories of some of the iniduals who have been supported through the helpline.Keith is the latest recipient of the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.

He said:“I think politically it is a non runner because any Irish government that would acquiesce to such proposals, as part of an overall deal, and it would not be able to stop themthey weren’t prepared to acquiesce to them, well I think they would be writing their political death warrant ...”The proposals,accepted, he said would establish Ireland as the “source of pain” in the Brexit process, undermine the Good Friday Agreement and insult the people of Northern Ireland.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.
