Ghost gear can be limited by making boats register their equipment, and return with it or be fined: if it is broken it can be recycled. Tagging it with GPS locators would also discourage dumping.Sustainable fishing is possible, though the film goes out of its way to decry it, and stocks can bounce back. Take the Patagonian toothfish, known as ‘white gold’ in the trade — since it can fetch $100 a gram — and marketed as the more appealing ‘Chilean sea bass’. Once close to collapse, its fishery has been returned to health.Closer to home, stopping trawling and dredging in favour of less destructive fishing in Lyme Bay, agreed between local fisherman and the Blue Marine Foundation, has brought an almost fourfold increase in the abundance of commercially valuable fish. In the last weeks, ministers banned trawling in over 304 sq km off Sussex.Marine reserves can also make a big difference. Even ones that allow some fishing have, one study found, doubled fish biomass, while ‘no-take zones’ where fishing is banned have multiplied it more than sixfold. This even benefits fishermen by increasing their catches, as life spills out of the protected areas into waters where fishing continues.Lobsters and king scallops have increased fourfold in a once devastated ‘no-take’ zone, established by local demand, off the Scottish Isle of Arran in 2008.So far, less than 5 per cent of the world’s oceans are protected. This needs to increase to 30 per cent over the next decade.A Global Ocean Treaty — to be discussed at a UN meeting in August — offers an opportunity, if done well enough, to tackle the fishing industry globally, and to protect the oceans by 2030.The Government is alive to the crisis of the oceans. It, and its predecessors, have done well in establishing giant reserves in all of the world’s main oceans.Now it needs to do much more in increasing reserves, promoting truly sustainable fishing worldwide, and ending pollution by discarded fishing gear.It is a shame that Seaspiracy is failing to use its enormous impact to help bring about such changes.But maybe now that it has sensitised so many to the problems, others can come in with the real solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"Travellers set free Covid testing kits countries join green list","story":"Share this article The latest numbers from the Covid Symptom Study complimented data released by NHS Test and Trace today, which showed the number of people testing positive for Covid fell by a fifth to 29,293 between March 25 and March 31 compared to the previous week.Some 4.8million people were tested at least once during the week — an 18 per cent fall on the previous week — because some schools shut earlier for Easter.The fall was a significant drop off compared to the drop seen in the previous week (one per cent) and the week before that (five per cent), suggesting cases are beginning to fall at an increased rate again.Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at King\u0027s College London and the lead scientist on the Covid Symptom Study, added: \u0027Admissions and deaths are also continuing to decline, putting the UK in a similar place to July last year. It\u0027s unlikely that cases will continue to fall at this pace, but with the vaccinations programme and the weather improving, it\u0027s likely they will remain low.\u0027The study estimates one in 1,394 people suffered from Covid symptoms last week, with 1,529 people becoming ill per day in England, compared to 316 in Scotland, 79 in Wales and zero in Northern Ireland.  The figures are based on over a million app users reporting their symptoms and so cannot take into account people who get the virus but don\u0027t have symptoms. It also doesn\u0027t include people in hospitals or care homes. Rates were lowest in the North East of England, with no one developed symptoms, and the East Midlands, where just 92 became ill each day.They were highest in the Yorkshire and the Humber (454) and London (305), while the East of England was the only other area of the country to see less than a hundred a day (99). The estimated R rate, measuring the number of people infected by each person with the virus, is close to 0.8 in England and Scotland and just 0.5 in Wales. An R of 1 means the outbreak is neither growing nor shrinking.SAGE will publish an updated official estimate of the R rate later today. Last week it was thought to be somewhere between 0.8 and 1. NHS Test and Trace data today showed the number of people testing positive for the virus is beginning to fall at a faster rate again, dropping for the twelfth week in a row.Positive tests fell from around 37,000 to 29,000 in the weeks March 18 to 24 and March 24 to 31 respectively — a drop of 20.9 per cent.The fall comes after a period of levelling off, with the most recent data showing falls fell five per cent and one per cent in the two weeks before hand as children returned to the classrooms and testing ballooned.But test numbers did fall in the most recent week, contributing to the large drop in positive cases. The number of tests fell from 5.8million to 4.8million, as some shool children began their Easter holiday, after peaking at 6.2million in the week from March 11 to March 17.The positivity rate — a better measure of the pandemic when testing jumps significantly — shows the percentage of tests that were positive in the most recent week has continued to fall.Just 0.61 per cent of tests were positive in the week ending March 31, down from 0.63 per cent the week before. This figure peaked at 16.7 per cent in the height of the second wave from December 24 to 30. "},{"url":null,"title":"Why pets make great friends terrible passwords","story":"Share this article The Government organisation recommended that a password should be made up of three random words to make it difficult to guess. Other weak passwords commonly used by Britons were a significant date or a favourite sports team, according to research by the NCSC.It also found that 6 per cent used the word \u0027password\u0027 in their login.\u0027We may be a nation of animal lovers but using your pet\u0027s name as a password could make you an easy target for cyber criminals,\u0027 said the centre\u0027s director of policy and communications Nicola Hudson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e46618246a9c31ee265b0ae6e225f90d4bb234e/0_157_950_570/master/950.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b1ce2b60a6569d58122d7ee3b2919848","title":"from taking a sound bath to rehydrating 10 ways to boost your energy in the morning","story":"“Our morning routine sets the tone for the rest of the day, so spending the time we would normally be travelling to work on self-care – rather than sleeping in and then reaching for a strong coffee – means we’ll have more energy and continue to reap the benefits right up until bedtime,” says holistic wellness and mindset expert Naomi Buff. Perhaps it’s time to reset the alarm and spend those 59 minutes boosting your body … Take a ‘sound bath’Instead of immediately grabbing your phone when you wake up, try a sound bath – a form of meditation using the vibrations of instruments – to ease you into the day. “Plugging yourself into a recorded sound bath before you’ve got out of bed helps to decrease tension and fatigue and increase focus and clarity,” says Buff, who has a Facebook page that’s dedicated to sound healing. “Immersing ourselves in calmness and positive vibes can help us achieve a deeper connection to ourselves.” RehydrateAt night we lose water through sweating and breathing out moisture and by our kidneys making urine, so when we wake up after eight hours our bodies are parched. “Drinking a large glass of water first thing takes little time but is vital for our mental and physical wellbeing,” says Buff. “When we’re dehydrated we feel tired and sluggish, so a simple glass of water can immediately boost energy levels and fire up our bodies.” Have a ‘brain dump’Writing – or having a brain dump – in the morning is a concept from The Artist’s Way, Julia Cameron’s 1992 bestselling book on creativity. In the book she claims that writing “three pages of whatever crosses your mind” first thing in the morning will awaken your senses and make you more productive due to a connection between the inner and the physical self when we write. Lift something heavy“Just 10 minutes of lifting some heavy weights is enough to get the blood pumping around your body and make you feel mentally fierce,” says fitness and strength trainer Nicole Prasad. “Lifting weights can boost energy, build confidence and help manage depression, anxiety and stress – which are good intentions to set for the day.” Just one weight plate (or dumbbell or kettlebell) could transform simple bodyweight squats or sit-ups into something more powerful. Have a good stretch“A morning stretch can reverse tightness caused from sitting, reduce aches and pains and make us more alert,” says Prasad. YouTube is full of quick, free stretching routines which, when done regularly, should put more of a spring in your step. Turn down the heat in the showerBlasting your body with cold water can reduce stress, build resilience, raise levels of alertness, increase willpower and improve your circulation and immune system. “Start by turning the temperature to cold at the end of your normal shower for 20 seconds and increase the time a little each day,” says Prasad. “I suggest that my clients use this exhilarating burst as a daily reset button. Telling yourself that whatever has gone before will get reset by the cold water is mentally liberating.” Check out wimhofmethod for more details on the benefits of a cold shower. Make a nutritious breakfastThey say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and “they” would be correct. “The ideal breakfast should contain some protein and some fat, ideally with optional complex carbohydrates, combined with a variety of colours from fruit or veg,” says Jenny Tschiesche, nutritionist and founder of lunchboxdoctor. “This combination slowly releases energy, allows you to concentrate better and focus more on the day ahead.” Use your extra time to make some porridge with fruit, cook some poached eggs or mix greek yoghurt with fruit and seeds. Play some music“Music is an immediate mood booster that can completely shift your energy,” says Buff. “Listening to a piece of music that you enjoy can cause the brain to increase pleasure-causing substances such as melatonin and decrease stress.” Get into the habit of popping on some music that makes you feel really alive before zoning into work. Sniff some essential oilsHaving a sniff of something uplifting literally takes seconds and can add immediate oomph to your morning. “Add a few drops of a citrus oil – like wild orange or lemon – to cupped hands and take three big slow inhalations,” says Nicola Burnett, founder of Oil Things Natural. “Studies show that the molecules present in citrus oils cross the blood-brain barrier when inhaled, having a direct impact on the areas that control feelings of anxiety and stress, creating a happy start to the day and stopping any stresses in their tracks.” "},{"url":null,"title":"let negativity go seven ways to nail your morning routine and have a productive day","story":"“By doing this, you’ll be cultivating what the Danish call ‘morgenfrisk’ – or morning freshness,” says Rachel Kelly, a mental health campaigner, and author of Singing in the Rain: 52 Practical Steps to Happiness. “We experience a flood of cortisol, the stress hormone, first thing, which gives us the boost we need to get up, but this can also make us anxious. Waking up with a calming routine that’s a pleasant process – whether that’s stretching and deep breathing, or simply giving yourself a moment to acknowledge your thoughts and feelings – can be hugely beneficial.” In other words, getting your morning routine nailed is well worth the time. Be realistic with your wake-up timeThough there isn’t any published research on the topic, many sleep scientists believe that the extra minutes of shuteye after you hit the snooze button don’t do any good – in fact, post-alarm snoozing can even derail your whole day. The reason? If you wake up and then doze, your brain is braced for the second alarm and it won’t let you dip back into the deep, restful stage of sleep, meaning you wake up feeling groggy. Instead, set your alarm for when you need to get up and you’ll score uninterrupted, restorative high-quality sleep. Once you’re up, throw those curtains back. Sunshine is an energising tonic, halting the production of melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy, plus it also sends signals to your body to start producing the happiness hormone, serotonin. Let go of negative thoughtsNegative niggles keep popping into your head? “Let them pass,” says Kelly. “If we don’t get in the habit of building a narrative around negative or fearful thoughts, they can pass very quickly.” Still struggling? Try recognising thoughts rather than arguing them. For instance: “This is anger. This is boredom. This is frustration.” By doing this, you’ll realise that your thoughts are just thoughts, not truths or something you need to necessarily act on. You could also try the “floating technique” for anxiety, where you simply stand back and watch your thoughts float past in your head, like leaves on a stream or passing clouds.

File photograph: Alan BetsonTeachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) in special schools across at least three counties have been vaccinated ahead of schedule, it has emerged.Staff in special schools in Wexford, Dublin and Galway have been vaccinated despite a Government decision to remove teachers from the priority list for vaccination in favour of an age-based approach.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has apologised for any errors which resulted in school staff being categorised as frontline health workers on the basis that they worked with many high-risk children with disabilities in residential settings. It said these decisions were made in “good faith”.The Government’s decision to remove teachers from the priority list sparked anger among teachers’ unions who voted on Wednesday to hold ballots for strike action unless they are reprioritised for vaccination by the end of the current school year.Special schoolsFórsa, the union which represents SNAs, said the development underlined the need to ensure its members across all special schools are vaccinated as soon as possible.Andy Pike, the union’s head of education, said he will raise the matter with the Minister for Education Norma Foley at the union’s conference on Friday.“There are few other groups outside health and social care who work on a consistent basis providing intimate care without the ability to maintain social distancing,” he said.“In special schools, healthcare staff like nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists have all been vaccinated, whilst the SNAs who work alongside them have not.”Mr Pike said he hoped the Government would introduce a parallel process to allow SNAs and others frontline workers in schools to be vaccinated on a priority basis.Ms Foley, however, has said that the change to the vaccination programme was based on age being the single most important factor in Covid-19 causing severe illness, hospitalisation and death.She said this week that the decision was not a reflection on any one profession and had been driven by science.The Government’s target is for 80 per cent of adults to have had their first vaccine dose by the end of June.Reserve listThe early vaccination of some school staff emerged earlier this week, when about 50 staff in special schools in the Dublin area were among a total of 191 people who were called from a reserve list to be vaccinated at the Aviva Stadium to “avoid wastage” .They were called from a reserve list after a group of people from a disability service provider did not arrive for their jabs due to a “misunderstanding around vaccine scheduling”.“No vaccines were wasted and their appointments are being rescheduled,” the HSE said in a statement.The HSE has since confirmed that vaccines were administered to a “small number” of school staff at a special school in Co Wexford, while sources have confirmed that staff at a special school in Co Galway were also vaccinated recently.He said he understood that officials were seeking to “do the right thing” they had not followed the correct protocols.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Partnership with Equinor will see 1.4GW offshore wind farm using floating technologyTransforming bogs could reduce CO2 emissions and improve bioersity, Water Forum says"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Celtic Mist, donated by the Haughey family, now serving as a research vessel for conservation body"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4532433.1617920941!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 hse set to recruit additional 3 500 vaccinators","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE has sought expressions of interest from pharmacies interested in offering vaccinations. Photograph: iStockThe Health Service Executive is set to recruit up to 3,500 extra vaccinators in coming weeks, though it insists it has enough people ready to ramp up deliveries before they come into service.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the organisation was approaching the next phase of the rollout with “great confidence” as he outlined vaccine rollout plans for the weeks ahead.However, at a press conference on Thursday, Mr Reid did not say precisely how April’s target of about 860,000 vaccinations administered would be met over the coming weeks.Mr Reid said the HSE expected 180,000-190,000 doses would be administered next week and the following week “looks strong enough as well”.Saying the target of about 860,000 was first mentioned by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and that it included people vaccinated at the start of the month as well, Mr Reid added: “We do see ourselves getting up towards 200,000 starting next week.”The HSE has declined to say how many vaccinators it will have working each week in April, with Mr Reid previously saying it would vary depending on supplies.Vaccination centresThirty-eight vaccination centres have been set up. So far, 17 have been used, and the rest will come on stream as vaccine deliveries increase. Vaccination centres will be staffed by HSE staff and by full-time and part-time people recruited in local and national campaigns under way. So far, 1,100 recruits are already in place, or with contracts signed and with agreed start dates. Another 700 are being finalised through a clearance process and a further 1,750 people have been identified through the recruitment process and are deemed suitable.In all, 3,500 people are being readied for deployment, along with the HSE’s own 5,500 trained vaccinators. Mr Reid could not offer details on the number of the HSE’s existing staff that will work in the centres.He said, “We want to get experienced people in” while acknowledging it would be a “draw on the system”. GPs and pharmacists will also be used. “As we see it, April and May we’re resourced. We have our resources aligned around the volumes coming at us and we will scale it up further in June,” he said.The HSE has sought expressions of interest from pharmacies interested in offering vaccinations, and work is under way on the IT system that would be required. A pilot will go live shortly.Doctors, nurses and midwives, pharmacists, physiotherapists, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, dentists and optometrists are entitled to become vaccinators.So far, more than 4,800 people have applied. The closing date for the national recruitment campaign is April 21st, though the closing date has been extended a number of times. “We intend to keep rolling out the closing date as long as there is a level of interest in the role with a view to maximising the additional workforce required and to avoid putting at risk existing service provision,” Mr Reid said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 273,701 had received their second dose.Some 188,806 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 338,338 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 366,910 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp46,502 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4532295.1617899795!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu funding of meat and dairy promotions irresponsible greenpeace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA €3.6 million ‘become a beefatarian’ campaign, funded by the European Union. European Union spending of hundreds of millions of euro on promoting agricultural products is “at odds with warnings from scientists on the disastrous impact industrial animal farming has on nature, the climate and our health” and is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money, according to Greenpeace Europe.The European Commission spent 32 per cent of its €777 million five-year farm product promotion budget on advertising campaigns for meat and dairy that ran between 2016 and 2020, a Greenpeace report published on Thursday found.In Ireland, 78 per cent of funded promotions were targeted at meat and dairy consumption over a four-year period up to 2019 – the highest proportion of European Union countries analysed by Greenpeace.Its EU agriculture and forest campaigner Sini Eräjää said: “When all the science is telling us to cut meat and dairy for our health, and the planet’s health, it’s unacceptable that the EU spends a quarter of a billion euro to accelerate consumption.“Farming and eating industrial meat and dairy puts us at risk of new pandemics, wrecks the climate and destroys nature – it’s irresponsible for the EU to continue promoting this with taxpayers’ money.”The research found the commission spent €146 million on campaigns for fruit and vegetables over the five years – 19 per cent of advertising spend.Leaked versions of the EU’s flagship Farm to Fork strategy and the Beating Cancer Plan suggested the commission intended to stop funding promotion of red and processed meat, which are particularly harmful, Ms Eräjää said. The final versions of both strategies contained more vague wording on promoting healthier diets, she said.The commission is reviewing its policy on the promotion of EU farm products, with a new proposal expected in early 2022. Last month it opened public consultation on promotion policy.Greenpeace is calling on the EU to end public funding for the promotion of meat and dairy products and recommending it be used to support ecological, small-scale farmers in Europe, and to help conventional farmers to transition to ecological methods.‘Skewed’ numbersThe numbers for Ireland “are even more skewed” in favour of meat and dairy products, Ms Eräjää said, as “78 per cent of the EU spending on projects run by Irish organisations was used to promote exclusively meat and dairy in the period 2016-2019 – country-level information isn’t yet available for 2020”.This was “certainly not in line with encouraging consumption that’s better for the environment and public health”.Ireland received €13.4 million in total EU funding, €10.5 million of which was to support meat and dairy promotion projects – just €1.4 million was spent targeting consumption of fruits and vegetables. Of nine countries subjected to deeper analysis, Spain and Ireland were found to have spent nothing on promoting organic products.While there are some differences between countries, the overall picture remains the same, the report concluded, much more funding is being used to exclusively promote meat and dairy products than is used to promote fruits and vegetables.Objectives in the approved funding applications of several meat and dairy promotional campaigns funded by the EU “explicitly state they aim to reverse declines in, or maintain the growth of, meat and dairy consumption in Europe – even if this reduction is much needed according to health and environmental research”.More than 70 per cent of EU farmland is used to raise livestock or produce animal feed. “Two-thirds of EU farm subsidies currently end up supporting the production of animal products, directly and indirectly, including by supporting feed production,” the report said.Europeans consume about twice as much meat as the global average, and about three times as much dairy. “To protect public health and nature, and to tackle the climate emergency, scientists are recommending a reduction of European meat and dairy consumption by at least 70 per cent by 2030,” Greenpeace said.The report featured examples of promotions including a “proud of beef campaign”, with €3.6 million of EU funding, which promoted the idea of becoming a “beefatarian”, supposedly to promote “balanced, healthy diets”.“The campaign fails to make any reference to the widely-recognised health risks or environmental damage associated with red and processed meat,” the report said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4532347.1617910573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 shops most commonly visited places listed by people later infected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSince March 31st, contact tracers investigating confirmed cases have been going back seven days instead of two days.  File photograph: Alan Betson The first comprehensive study of community transmission of Covid-19 in the State has identified shops as the most likely source of infection. Since March 31st, contact tracers investigating confirmed cases have been going back seven days instead of two days in an attempt to identify how people got infected. Of the 3,476 positive cases since then, 787 (22 per cent) were as a result of community transmission, where the source of infection is not known. More than 60 per cent of these community transmission cases were recorded in Dublin. Of those who did not know the source of their infection, 55.8 per cent mentioned shops as the most likely place they would have picked up the disease in the previous seven days. This was followed by workplaces (15.6 per cent), primary schools (3.8 per cent), public transport or car sharing (3.5 per cent), travel at home or abroad (2 per cent), outdoor gatherings (1.9 per cent), pre-school gatherings (1.8 per cent) and outdoor sports activities (1.7 per cent).Almost 9 per cent listed “other” as being a potential source not listed on the Health Service Executive (HSE) questionnaire and seven people said they knew no possible source of transmission.Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead for track and trace, said the findings of the contract tracers do not mean that shops are necessarily unsafe environments. “All the list tells you is where people were. It does not tell you that you got it there. The high numbers from shops reflect where people have been,” she said.“Having identified possible sources, we have to then go further and identify the actual sources.” The number of those stating they tested positive after attending social gatherings such as funerals, birthday parties, hairdressers or salons was too small to be measured. Ms O’Beirne said if a person believed they were infected at a social gathering, that social gathering is investigated and it usually leads to other cases. As the source of infection is then known, it is not included among the community transmission cases. The Covid-19 walk-in test centres tested 25,413 people at 14 centres nationwide. Finglas and Blanchardstown had the highest positivity rate of more than 4 per cent, the average positivity rate was 2.6 per cent. To date, 635 Covid-19 cases have been identified through the centres. They were intended for those who were asymptomatic, but half of those who tested positive did have symptoms and 40 per cent have been subsequently identified as close contacts of confirmed cases.

What\u0027s a short appointment, and what\u0027s the medium appointment, and what\u0027s a long appointment? I\u0027ve got no idea, and I doubt whether the Government has any idea either.Richard Lambert, the chief executive of the National Hair and Beauty Association, said massage parlours may choose to shorten their appointments to stay within the new guidelines.There are places that offer massages of 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes and 90 minutes, he said. They may decide that they’d rather not do 90-minute massages.The second step of Boris Johnson\u0027s lockdown roadmap will see the reopening of close contact services like hair and beauty salons and nail bars on Monday for the first time since the beginning of the third national lockdown on Jan 5.Many hairdressers have reported they are solidly booked for the first month after reopening. Toni \u0026amp Guy, which operates more than 100 branches in the UK, said most of its salons were fully booked until at least the second week of May.The UK’s rush to get a haircut will be a boon to the industry, which has suffered during three successive lockdowns.Almost 5,000 hair and beauty businesses have already closed, and the British Beauty Council estimates the sector will shrink by around 20 per cent as a result of the pandemic.When salons open staff must wear PPE, including a visor, and customers should wear a face mask when they are sitting in waiting rooms. The guidance says salons should operate an appointment-only system to avoid a build-up of walk-in customers in waiting areas.Staff should also turn down music to avoid customers having to raise their voices and risk the virus through droplets, and visitors must register their details with NHS Test and Trace on arrival.Industry bosses have raised concerns about new guidelines on ventilation in salons, which was added after new evidence suggested that the virus could be kept at bay if there was enough air flow indoors.Mllie Kendall, the chief executive of the British Beauty Council, said small beauty businesses were more likely to be hit by additional costs.A lot of the largest businesses have got great ventilation, but it will be those small freelance or sole practitioners that rent a room at the back of a shop where there\u0027s not enough ventilation, she said.

He grumbles that there’s only one real certainty about Covid: when things go wrong, Britain tends to get hit worst. That certainly was the experience of last year – but the surprise, now, is that things are going badly right. He is now facing the very real prospect that his “scientific cavalry” has not only arrived but is fairly close to winning the battle against coronavirus.The vaccines have worked, better than anyone expected. More effective and more eagerly sought-after than any modeller dared to imagine. British Covid deaths are now the lowest in Europe, having fallen faster than even in Israel. There are no more “excess deaths” – in fact, fewer people are dying, now, than normal. The data has for some time, been unremittingly positive. Several parts of the country have been virtually Covid-free for several weeks.The idea that we might achieve herd immunity on Monday – as a model from UCL suggests – is unexpected. But entirely plausible. We heard about herd immunity quite a lot at the start of the pandemic, because this is how viruses die. Infections keep rising until a certain percentage of the population is protected – either by recovery, or vaccination. The figure of 60 per cent was mentioned at first. Other estimates go as high as 85 per cent: as ever, with Covid, no one is quite sure. But whatever the threshold is, Britain looks likely to hit it soon.Importantly, this is now Government policy: to achieve herd immunity by autumn through mass vaccination. The target may be reached earlier: a Bristol University model says August. Perhaps UCL is right and we will arrive at this promised land next week. After which there should – in theory – not be much need for restrictions. It ought to be impossible for Covid to overwhelm the health service again. It would be an incredible prize, one of the greatest scientific achievements of our times. It’s not just possible, but probable.But the timing? No one can know for sure. This takes us back to the debate about vaccine passports, the future of lockdown and a summer of travel restrictions. The current thinking inside No 10 is that lockdown ends on 21 June, with herd immunity by September 30. So what regime should exist in between these dates? How likely is the virus to stage a summer revival? What bridging measures, if any, should be in place? This is the basis of the reviews into social distancing, travel bans and the rest.It’s a perfectly sensible argument – but one not yet being made in public. In part, this is because “herd immunity” is seen as a politically toxic phrase. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, used it once and was stunned to find himself accused of a secret plan to sacrifice the elderly. As he found out, social media helps hysteria spread faster than any virus. It was a brutal lesson in the new politics of pandemics: never mention the h-word.Another reason to keep quiet about this is the still-huge element of doubt. If a new variant escapes the vaccine, or if recovery immunity is found to be short-lived, the whole herd immunity argument collapses.Yet so far, the signs are encouraging. Pfizer claims to be 100 per cent effective in South Africa, home of the notorious variant, and the numbers of Covid reinfections worldwide are tiny. This gives ground for political optimism: herd immunity will (probably) arrive. Maybe not quite on Monday, but soon. And that ought to change everything.This takes us back to the case for candour. Would it be so bad, now, to admit to a herd immunity strategy? There have been discussions in government about renaming it “community immunity” or “collective immunity”. It seems odd to be working towards a goal that can’t be properly explained.But a lack of clarity causes problems, as we saw this week. The argument for young people being jabbed is to help achieve herd immunity, to protect others. But squeamishness about admitting this led to the bizarre situation where young people were told that vaccination is a matter of personal risk. One graph shown suggested that, given the low prevalence of the virus, the risk to under-30s from blood clots with AstraZeneca was almost the same as the risk from Covid. Both are very low risks, but it’s an unpersuasive message. As is dangling the threat of vaccine passports, as if to say: get the jab if you ever want to see the inside of a nightclub again.A more direct – and honest message – may work better: get the jab to stop the spread. The statistician David Spiegelhalter puts it well. For younger people, he says, “being vaccinated is as much a contribution to the community and their relatives and the people around them”. The last year has shown young people making all kinds of sacrifices to fend off a virus that they know will barely affect them. It’s hard to argue that they would not respond to plain arguments now. Matt Hancock is toying with a new soundbite: “do your bit.” But it’s no substitute for a broader discussion.Talking things through more openly may also improve the quality of decisions inside the Government. In one Whitehall meeting recently, there was serious discussion about new rules for hugging: should it be allowed outdoors, but not indoors? More worryingly, the taskforce setting the rules on international travel last week managed an entire strategy session without any serious discussion about the economic damage imposed by quarantines. In a country where over two million jobs depend on tourism, that’s quite an omission.We saw something else in this week’s AstraZeneca debate: blood clots discussed calmly, as a balance of risk. To hear Dr Alison Astles urge people to “keep saving lives” by taking the vaccine, after her brother died of side effects, has been one of the most moving moments of the pandemic. It would be quite something if this sparks a change in tone – where ministers move beyond podium slogans and start a more direct, transparent discussion about what now lies ahead.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"man shipped home australia searching irish friends helped seal","story":"A Welsh man who shipped himself home from Australia has launched an appeal to find two Irish men who helped seal him inside a crate.Brian Robson, 75, from Cardiff, was 19-years-old and working in Melbourne for Victorian Railways when he became homesick. Mr Robson was in the country on an assisted immigration programme in 1964, which meant if he returned home early he would have to repay around £700, according to the . He was earning just £40 a month and so hatched a plan ship himself home via air-freight.Mr Robson had made friends with two Irish men at work and seconded their help to carry out the plan. “I’m 99 per cent sure that they were called Paul and John,” he told the . “Paul really was 100 per cent against it … but John said, ‘Don’t worry about it, I’ll persuade him.’ And so, they both went ahead and helped.”He purchased a wooden crate the size of a mini-fridge and booked a shipment with Qantas airline. Paul and John helped Mr Robson into the box, along with his suitcase and pillows and nailed it shut. A report by Reuters from May 1965 shows Mr Robson had labelled the contents of his box a computer.The journey was quite a horrific experience, he said, and despite also labelling the crate this side up at one point he was flipped upside and left standing on his head for a day.The flight was expected to take 36 hours and arrive in London, but four days later he landed in Los Angeles. He was investigated by the FBI, but later released and flown home first class by Pan Am. Mr Robson has now written a book, the Crate Escape, detailing the journey but has been unable to track down his Irish friends.He wrote to them when he returned home but did not receive a reply.“I did try a couple of times, I think, and of course we didn’t have (the) internet in those days, so from that day to this I’ve never spoken to them.

Brussels now has an embryonic common security and foreign policy. It has a foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, and its own diplomatic service and network of embassies. It even poses as a power equivalent to the United States or China, worthy of its own representation in international forums. But the humiliation of EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, at the hands of Turkey’s President Erdogan exposes the EU’s claims to foreign policy unity to be a sham.The episode was as ridiculous as it was telling. As if to celebrate Turkey’s withdrawal from the convention on violence against women, at a meeting in Ankara this week von der Leyen was relegated to a sofa on the sidelines as the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, was invited to take a chair next to Erdogan. Von der Leyen had to clear her throat to catch their attention.Michel has since explained that he was given the top seat because of the “strict interpretation by the Turkish services of protocol rules” under which he is senior to von der Leyen. But it is a poor excuse. The etiquette governing international meetings evolved because the symbolism of these events reflects real power balances. Allowing von der Leyen to take the sofa was a snub, and one made all the worse by the appearance it gave of Michel kowtowing to Erdogan’s antediluvian attitudes towards women.But the bigger question is surely: why were there even two presidents at one meeting? Indeed, what sort of organisation has so many presidents that it requires an order of seniority akin to those that govern members of an extended royal family?It’s not as if the EU is normally a model of effective diplomacy. Brussels’s grandly-titled “high representative of the Union for foreign affairs”, Mr Borrell, has blundered through a series of foreign policy of disasters in recent months. Most notoriously, he was humiliated during a visit to Moscow: the Russian foreign minister used their joint press conference to accuse the EU of lying about the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, absurd allegations to which Mr Borrell failed to respond.It’s also not as if the EU’s member states are themselves committed to a common front against the West’s enemies. The appearance of European disunity has only been compounded by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron’s attempts to secure access to Vladimir Putin’s Sputnik V vaccine. The state of Bavaria this week even signed a preliminary contract for 2.5 million doses. Dependence on Russian gas for its heavy industrial producers and Sputnik V for public health gives the Kremlin a choke-hold in Berlin not seen since Merkel was a girl – but then it was only over East Germany. For Macron, this represents the lowest moment of a vaccine fiasco that has seen his diplomatic standing plumb new depths.Michel and von der Leyen should have stood up to President Erdogan. His slide into authoritarianism is troubling. The migrant crisis remains without a long-term resolution, no matter how many billions the European Union has handed over to Ankara. Erdogan has behaved in recent years more like an enemy than an ally of Nato and treated Greece, an EU member, with disdain. Meanwhile, Turkey’s economy is on its knees and its government desperately short of funds. The EU was in a position of enormous strength. Yet somehow it still walked away with appalling terms.Britain may be out of the European Union, but an impotent Europe is not a comfortable neighbour. Its blend of arrogance and incompetence invites predatory behaviour from the enemies of the West.

Outside she said she saw something the club had never witnessed in its 16 years of operation: a perfect, orderly queue. “The crowd always just wants to get in but after this year, they were all very polite, they waited,” said Ms Tokatly. “Clubbers don’t always have a lot of stuff on them, just their money in their pockets, but this time everyone came organised with their ID and with the application and everything.”Rolled out incrementally since March 7, Israel\u0027s Green Pass allows holders to show either a phone application or a certificate issued by the Ministry of Health showing that they have been vaccinated, recovered from the virus, or obtained a negative PCR test result within 48 hours of attending an event. It has allowed Israelis to return to gyms, hotels, indoor dining at restaurants, theatres, concerts and most recently nightclubs too. It is not needed to enter shops or shopping malls. Events using the Green Pass will be allowed to host thousands of guests for Independence Day celebrations next week. Israel’s experience rolling out the scheme could prove illustrative as the UK government considers Covid passports as a way to reopen the economy, despite opposition over privacy, civil liberties and data protection concerns. Israel has hailed its Green Pass as a “world-class” experiment. “No one else has tried it,” said Ran Balicer, the chairman of the National Expert Advisory Panel to the Government on COVID-19, in comments carried in the Jerusalem Post.Other countries including Bahrain, China, Denmark and Japan have introduced similar schemes.Israelis have generally acknowledged that the Green Pass has worked well, though there have been some issues in implementation. Last month, police arrested a man accused of forging Green Passes and vaccination certificates and offering them for sale in a Telegram group with tens of thousands of members.Israeli police lack the manpower to check every venue adopting the Green Pass system, so enforcement necessarily relies on businesses checking their customers’ identification and passes. “Just as the police does not stand and check who has a ticket to get into a cinema, or who can get into a gym – who is above 16, and who is not – you have the proprietors of the establishments, and municipal and government supervisors” to do that, Public Security Minister Amir Ohana said last month.Opposition to the Green Pass has been largely limited to a small fringe of coronavirus denialists and anti-vaxxers, according to Nadav Eyal, a columnist for Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.He credited the system with allowing Israelis returning to some semblance of normal life without coronavirus cases surging. “People are going to shows, they’re seeing music, they’re going to lectures, coffee shops – it’s been more than a month now and you’re not seeing an outbreak,” he said.At the peak of Israel’s outbreak in January, authorities recorded over  10,000 new cases in a single day. Today the country is averaging about 300 new cases daily and closing dedicated coronavirus wards.“We’re over this phase of asking whether this is something we want to do here,” Mr Eyal said. “Right now we’re in a different position of asking how do you make sure that compliance remains high when at any rate most of the population is vaccinated?”While over half of Israel’s population of over nine million has been fully vaccinated, the vaccine is not yet available to children under 16. And an estimated one million Israeli adults have not taken the opportunity to get vaccinated, meaning that other preventative measures to contain outbreaks are still necessary.But any would-be British tourists hoping to escape lockdown restrictions in a post-covid paradise will have to wait. For now Israel is still closed to most foreigners and the Green Pass is only available to its citizens.  With reporting by Quique Kierszenbaum  in JerusalemMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz vaccine administered first time uk","story":"In the week that the Government advised under-30s to seek an alternative vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines.As Europe once again changed its advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which vaccine was administered for the first time in the UK this week as part of the national vaccination rollout?As Britain prepares to ease lockdown restrictions in the next phase of the roadmap out of lockdown, drinkers have been told to take what with them to the pub next week to avoid falling foul of new rules?If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters you will have come across all of the answers to the quiz.

A bus was torched in west Belfast on Wednesday, while petrol bombs, fireworks and bits of masonry were hurled at police officers. Over several hours of disorder, youths pelted petrol bombs and other missiles at each other from both sides of a peace wall. A press photographer was also allegedly attacked. Disorder has also taken place in Derry, Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Ballymena in recent days. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts told a press conference: The scale of the disorder last night was at a scale that we have not seen in recent years in Belfast or further afield. Boris Johnson and Taoiseach Micheal Martin issued a joint call for calm after speaking over the phone on Thursday.In a statement, the Irish Government said the two leaders stressed that violence was unacceptable. The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the statement said. They agreed that the two governments would continue to stay in contact.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday for crisis talks aimed at calming tensions exacerbated by a toxic cocktail of Brexit and coronavirus.The Stormont Assembly was recalled from the Easter recess for an emergency sitting on Thursday, where all parties condemned the violence. Here we look at the complex reasons for the disorder and why it matters. Brexit Changes to trade after the UK left the EU in January have played a role in exacerbating tensions in Northern Ireland. Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal effectively created a border down the Irish Sea, as goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland must be subject to checks. A key part of the deal, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, keeps Northern Ireland in the EUaposs single market for goods, which the rest of the UK left on January . The point of this idea was to prevent a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which remains in the EU.  Avoiding a land border is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement, the landmark peace deal which brought an end to most of the violence suffered during the Troubles. However the plan to avoid inflaming tensions with infrastructure at the Irish border has instead seen anger sht to ports, where threats were made to staff and menacing graffiti emerged. The reality of post-Brexit le - which has included some disruption to food supplies and online deliveries - has angered some in loyalist communities, over the perception that it has undermined Northern Irelandaposs place in the UK. Coronavirus laws A row over the decision not to prosecute  Sinn Fein politicians for attending a large funeral during the pandemic has also ratcheted up anger. The funeral of former IRA leader Bobby Storey last June was attended by a number of senior republican politicians, including Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill. Critics said the event broke coronavirus regulations, with large crowds appearing not to obey social distancing guidelines. However prosecutors decided last month not to take action over the event, partly due to lack of clarity in the Covid- rules and partly due to interaction between the organisers and police ahead of the funeral.  The decision sparked outrage among some loyalist communities over perceived preferential treatment for the republican community. Separately, months of living under strict lockdown rules may have also inflamed tensions. Paramilitary involvement There have been suggestions that paramilitary gangs have been stoking the violence in some areas, either directly or by encouraging young people to riot. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said police were investigating whether there was any paramilitary involvement in the scenes in Belfast on Wednesday. In Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus, the PSNI believes paramilitary involvement is partly to do with a rogue faction - the South East Antrim UDA - reacting to recent police operations targeting its criminal empire. What are politicians saying  In a joint statement, the five-party Executive said: While our political positions are very dferent on many issues, we are all united in our support for law and order and we collectively state our support for policing and for the police officers who have been putting themselves in harmaposs way to protect others. We, and our departments, will continue to work together to maximise the support we can give to communities and the PSNI to prevent further violence and unrest.

The Department for Transportaposs Global Travel Taskforce, which is looking out how to reopen international travel from May  at the earliest, confirmed plans for a traffic light system outlining rules for passengers ing from overseas. But it dampened hopes for summer plans by insisting it was too early to outline countries which could be deemed safe for Britons to visit in the coming months. And it said an expected announcement on whether foreign holidays could resume would not come until next month. In a bit of good news, officials are looking at funding holidaymakersapos pre-flight coronavirus tests in a move to cut costs for families desperate for summer sunshine breaks. The DfT said it would “work with the travel industry and private testing providers ahead of international travel reopening to see how we can further reduce the cost of travel for the British public while ensuring travel is as safe as possible”. It added: “This could include cheaper tests being used when holidaymakershome, as well as whether the Government would be able to provide pre-departure tests.” Ministers are desperate not to jeopardise the success of the Covid- inoculation rollout by importing vaccine-resistant mutations from abroad. Experts will allocate nations to green, amber or red categories depending on countriesapos vaccination rates, infection levels and whether mutant strains – dubbed “iants of concern” – are re. The DfT said: “The risks posed by these iants remain signicant, and restrictions for inbound passengers, such as -day managed quarantine, home quarantine, and stringent testing will remain in place, but will apply to people dferently depending on whether the destination visited is categorised as green, amber or red.” Passengers landing from green nations will need to take a pre-departure test before flying back, as well as a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK. But they will not need to quarantine, unless they receive a positive result, or take any additional tests. Those ing from amber countries must self-isolate for  days and take a pre-departure test, a PCR test on day two and day eight, with the option for “test to release” on day five to end quarantine early. Arrivals from red countries must pay £, to quarantine for  days in a Government-approved hotel, undergo pre-departure testing and PCR testing on day two and eight. A “green watchlist” will be introduced to help identy countries most at risk of moving from green to amber. The DfT said: “It is too early to predict which countries will be on which list over the summer, and the Government continues to consider a range of factors to inform the restrictions placed on them. “We will set out by early May which countries will fall into which category, as well as confirming whether international travel can resume from May .”  Officials are eyeing countries like Israel and the US as places where Brits could travel without having to quarantine on their . But sources said it was “not near enough” to May  yet to decide which nations will be on the green, amber and red lists. A source said: “This tells you what the methodology is for the lists - countries will start being slotted in later.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “The framework announced today will help allow us to reopen travel safely and sustainably, ensure we protect our hard-won achievements on the vaccine rollout and offer peace of mind to both passengers and industry as we begin to take trips abroad once again.” The announcement was vague about a role for vaccine passports to make international travel easier. The DfT said: “The UK will also play a leading role in the development of international standards around a digital travel certication system.

Mr Sunak revealed the ex-Premier contacted a third Treasury minister in his role as a lobbyist for a financial firm.As Whitehall chiefs were battling to get to grips with the unprecedented hit to businesses and the economy just  days into the first coronavirus lockdown, Mr Sunak texted the former PM to tell him he would contact him.He later told him he would “push the team” to find options that might work, but added there were “no guarantees”. The Government has faced mounting questions over Whitehall links with Greensill Capital, which filed for insolvency after failing to secure cash through the Bank of Englandaposs Covid Corporate Financing Facility. Its collapse last month plunged the future of Liberty Steel, for whom Greensill was the main lender, into jeopardy – leaving , workers at  British plants fearing for their jobs. The former PM was said to have share options in Greensill worth up to million and concerns were raised about his lobbying on the firmaposs behalf – including sending text messages to Mr Sunak. Mr Cameron messaged the Chancellor on his private phone to ask for help for Greensill. Those texts have not been published. But the first message from Mr Sunak to Mr Cameron, sent on April  last year read: Hi David, thanks for your message. “I am stuck back to back on calls but will try you later this evening andgets too late, first thing tomorrow. Best, Rishi. The second message from Mr Sunak sent on April  said: Hi David, apologies for the delay. “I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the market notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi. It is understood Charles refers to Charles Roxburgh, the second most senior civil servant at the Treasury. The Chancellor was forced to provide the messages following a Freedom of Information request. The Treasury said: We are withholding the communications sent by David Cameron to the Chancellor. “These communications were made by David Cameron in his capacity as an employee of Greensill, and with an expectation of confidence.  Mr Sunak also confirmed the ex-PM lobbied three ministers, including himself, over the matter of Greensill Capitalaposs access to a Covid support scheme. In a letter to Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds last night, Mr Sunak wrote: I can confirm that David Cameron reached out informally by telephone to me, and to the Economic Secretary and the Financial Secretary, on the matter of Greensill Capitalaposs access to the CCFF . The matter was referred to the relevant officials and, following appropriate consultations as outlined in the previous requests, the request was turned down. During this process, this was communicated to Greensill Capital by officials and, in parallel, by me to David Cameron. Previously, it had only been disclosed that Mr Cameron contacted the Chancellor and Financial Secretary Jesse Norman, the former PMaposs fellow Old Etonian. But the revelation shows he went to a trio of finance ministers, including Economic Secretary John Glen. Ms Dodds said: These messages raise very serious questions about whether the Chancellor may have broken the Ministerial Code.

Brian Robson was -years-old when he became homesick while working for Victorian Railways in . Realising that a plane ticket home would cost him £ -  times his monthly salary - he cooked up a plan to get himself home.The now -year-old bought a small wooden crate and convinced two Irishmen he knew as Paul and John to stow him aboard a freight plane, he told the .The quite horric experience” took four days and saw Brian repeatedly stored upside down. Almost six decades on he is looking to reconnect with the men who helped him get home in a bid to thank them. “I’m % sure that they were called Paul and John,” he told the . “Paul really was % against it … but John said, ‘Don’t worry about it, I’ll persuade him.’ And so, they both went ahead and helped.” Ahead of his perilous journey back to Cardf, Wales, Brian packed a mini-fridge sized box with a pillow, a book of Beatles songs and a suitcase. One was for drinking in, the other urinating. He also took laxatives for three days before the big journey to make sure he wasnapost caught short.  His friends then nailed the package shut with Brian inside, labelled it as a computer and booked it onto a Qantas flight from Melbourne to London. The plan hit a slight ot in the road when Brian was transferred to a PanAm flight headed for Los Angeles because the original plane was full. There he was stored away in a freight shed where, having been stuck in the box for five days, he was too weak to hammer himself out. Luckily a man “looked through a hole in a wood knot in the chest and we caught each other eye to eye”, Brian told the BBC. “He jumped back a mile and said, ‘There’s a body in there.’”  After spending five days recovering in hospital he was questioned by the FBI before being released and allowed to fly on a passenger jet back to the UK. Australian MP Dan Mackinnon reacted strongly to news of the stowaway, demanding legal action against “this apparently useless young man”. The then-acting minister for immigration Leslie Bury said no action would be taken against him. When Brian got home he wrote to the two men, who he got got on famously with, but they never responded. Now he does not remember where they were from or what their surnames were.

Anyone will be able to access lateral flow tests for themselves and their families to use twice a week, in line with clinical guidance. Rapid tests give results in under  minutes and Brits are encouraged to take them as part of a regular testing system brought in to tackle the spread of Covid-. In particular, they are effective in spotting people who have no symptoms but could still spread the virus. The Government said regular testing will help everyone get back to normal le as infected people can be identied more efficiently eventhey do not develop a cough, temperature or lose their sense of smell and taste. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Around one in three people have coronavirus without any symptoms, so getting tested regularly is one of the simplest and easiest ways we can keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.I’d encourage everyone to take up the offer and test twice a week. “Alongside the successful rollout of the vaccination programme, rapid testing will be one of our most effective weapons in tackling this virus and ensuring we can cautiously reopen our economy and parts of society that we have all missed. The British people have made a tremendous effort throughout the pandemic and I am confident they will do the same now by taking up this offer of free, rapid tests.  From Sunday, April , the Hands, Face, Space, Fresh Air campaign will be updated to remind the public of the need to use the NHS Covid- app to check in to premises including outdoor hospitality, hairdressers and gyms. App users who visited a venue where multiple people tested positive for the virus will be then encouraged to book a test. TV doctor and practising NHS GP, Dr Zoe Williams said: “Twice weekly testing will be crucial in helping us manage the spread of the virus as society starts to reopen. “The tests are quick and easy to do, and results come back in  minutes.“Key workers such as myself and my colleagues have been carrying these out for the last few months, and it’s amazing how quickly they have become second nature to us. “However, it’s important to remember that there is not one silver bullet in the fight against Covid-, and even with a negative test result, we must still follow social distancing guidelines – hands, face, space, fresh air, and go for our vaccines when called.” Recent analysis from NHS Test and Trace shows that for every , lateral flow tests carried out, there is fewer than one  positive result.With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

According to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, .million people experienced food poverty between August  and February . And .m children live in households that are food insecure. There has been a % increase in children accessing food parcels. But across the UK, a movement is building. The Right to Food campaign is spreading through football fans, trade unions and even Parliament. In January, Liverpool became the first place to declare itself a Right to Food city. Manchester quickly followed suit, with cities from Newcastle to Brighton also joining. This week, the EFRA Committee called for the Government to consult on the Right to Food, and for a new Minister for Food Security. A ,- strong petition is growing daily. Today, the Mirror also backs the Right to Food. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section All eyes are now on Henry Dimbleby, whom the Prime Minister has tasked with creating a National Food Strategy. His final report is due in July, and his backing could be a major moment for the campaign. “Putting the ‘Right to Food’ into UK law would make the Government legally responsible to help anyone in our communities who is going hungry,” the petition reads. Driving this agenda is a Labour MP who came into Parliament in  with one clear aim – to end hunger in Britain. Liverpool FC-supporting MP Ian Byrne set up Fans Supporting Foodbanks in  with Evertonians Robbie Daniels and Dave Kelly, after seeing a queue near his Anfield home. “I thought it was for the bingo,” he says. “Someone took me round the back, and I saw people bagging up pasta in those little bags they used to use for p sweets. The queue was round the block. I lay awake all night thinking about it.”  The queue was close to Liverpool’s football ground, and less than a mile from Everton’s. “We thought, ‘there’s , fans heading to Anfield and , going to ­Goodison. If every fan brought a tin...’” Two wheelie bins grew to feeding the ,. Despite the success of Fans Supporting ­Foodbanks, Ian knew it was “only a sticking plaster”. To drive systemic change, he stood successfully as MP for Liverpool West Derby. He is now part of the Parliamentary EFRA Committee. The Right to Food movement is looking at a range of solutions from universal free school meals, to making the benefits system fairer, to ending insecure work, controlling utility bills and seeing people are paid a living wage to solve UK hunger. Groups like JustFair and Sustain UK are helping drive the project, while Unite and the Bakers Union have backed it. In Liverpool, communities have taken hunger into their own hands. At St Andrew’s Church, Clubmoor, we find Lilly Mason-Tang holding her baby and two shopping bags packed with fresh food. The -year-old mum of two has just finished her weekly food shop at the Local Pantry hosted by the church.  Next to shelves stacked with staples, a fridge is rammed with artisan cheese and meat, vegan meals and oat milk.“I’ve really struggled in the past,” Lilly says. “But now I come here for food, friendship and support. Today I’ve got loads of fresh fruit and veg, even some Easter eggs. I love coming here.”Lilly is one of almost , members enjoying the benefits of belonging to a new Your Local Pantry network run by Church Action on Poverty, which is thriving in Liverpool and expanding across the UK. For a maximum of £ a week, members choose  items – three premium ones and seven everyday ones, including non-food like nappies. Lilly pays £. and takes home about £ of food, saving up to £ a year. The pantry’s Victoria Ponsonby, , says they just had their busiest month. “We had , shops, up  on the month before,” she says. Pantries are a community. “My dad was a docker,” Victoria says. “I remember being seven, queueing to get food, seeing other kids and thinking, ‘no kid should behungry’.” The food pantry movement is growing, with  outlets nationwide. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, the Daily Mirror was calling on Boris Johnson to hike child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK was set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years. Our Give Me Five campaign wanted an immediate increase in child benefit - a move that would lt , children out of destitution. Our campaign was backed by charities, politicians and union leaders. However, as the global pandemic sparks a fresh recession - which the International Monetary Fund warns could be the worst since the Great Depression in the  - charities say more needs to be done. Action for Children is now calling on the Government to increase child benefit further, by £, to recognise the ever-worsening situation plunging children in poverty. Meanwhile the Joseph Rowntree Foundation is calling for a just emergency intervention, targeted to mitigate the immediate strain on low-income families. The charity says an increase of at least £ per child per week to the child element of Universal Credit and Child Tax Credits would go a long way to covering the increased costs posed by the current and potential subsequent lockdowns. Companies including Fare Share donate food that would go to landfill and independent producers sell goods at cost. Member Lynne Smith, , is helping to pack bags. “People leave here,” she says, “with their heads held high.” Lilly says: “I was grateful, but a foodbank isn’t somewhere anyone wants to go. I’m proud of coming here.” Fans Supporting Foodbanks has embraced the model, with a mobile van already delivering a food market pantry and five more planned to cover Liverpool’s “food deserts”. An art sketch club also runs from the vans.  “Why not  No one is any less than any ,” Ian says. He is full of plans for allotments and garden veg patches across Merseyside. “This is an important moment,” Ian says. “The pandemic has shone a light on the inequality communities face. Marcus Rashford, in that moment when he basically became Prime Minister, showed up the Government. But it transcends red and blue.

He added: It shows that Kate is someone who doesn’t have to speak out. She’s doing what Diana used to do, which is let her body language tell the story.” And the royal biographer noted Kate’s body language has begun to mirror William’s mother, who tragically passed away in a fatal car crash in Paris in .  “Kate has the Diana Walk,” he said. “Quickly and with determination was very much how Diana walked.” Meanwhile, Katie Nicholl, who is the author of Kate: The Future Queen, said that Kate had been William’s pillar of strength in recent times.

The schoolboy was rushed to hospital after the attack in Bootle, Merseyside, yesterday afternoon, and has since undergone surgery. His mum said the boy had been chased down the road and into the garden, where an eight-year-old was celebrating her birthday.According to the Liverpool Echo, witnesses said the attack was sparked when the boy was wrongly accused of throwing stones.A -year-old man has been arrested. The boyaposs mum, who declined to be named, told the Mail Online she felt sick to my stomach when she saw it happen.  She added that two men had attacked him, stating: One was on top of him kicking and punching him in the face, while the other stabbed him in the leg. She branded the attack horrendous, and said: Iaposm just relieved he is still with me. His family said the boy had walked to a nearby shop, just after pm yesterday, with a friend and was walking home.Stones had been thrown between the two of them, or at street lamps, his relative added, as they played together. The boyaposs grandmother told the Liverpool Echo: It was terrible. They came straight in the back garden and went for him, punching and kicking him and then stabbed him three times. There was a lot of blood so we just tried to keep pressure on the wound until the ambulance came. There was around  children in the garden and we got them inside as quick as we could.  Police have described the attack on a child of such a young age as despicable and say the stabbing was targeted. Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney said: “Although it is pleasing to have made a quick arrest, our investigation continues and we’re gathering all information to piece together the circumstances.

Even then it found  per cent of these patients told researchers that they had experienced no Covid symptoms. It suggests deaths and hospitalisations will continue to plummet evenpositive Covid- tests do not as we lt lockdown. Separate research focusing on symptomatic infections came from King’s College London and estimated the UK R value could now be just .. Prof Tim Spector OBE, lead scientist on the King’s study, said: “These figures are among the lowest in Europe.Have you had the vaccine yet  Let us know in the comments“Admissions and deaths are also continuing to decline, putting the UK in a similar place to July last year.“It’s unlikely that cases will continue to fall at this pace, but with the vaccinations programme and the weather improving, it’s likely they will remain low.”Government and scientists are desperate to maintain jab uptake after regulators changed the “clinical preference” for under-s to have Pfizer or Moderna jabs where available. It comes after Sage modelling suggested Britain could face a late-summer surge in Covid deathsvaccine uptake is low in young adults.  The change in clinical guidance came because scientists detected a one in a million chance of dying from a blood clot after getting the Oxford jab. Despite this they confirmed the AstraZeneca-made jab is safe and all ages are more likely to diethey refuse to be inoculated. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk of experiencing a brain clot after the Oxford jab was the same as “taking a long-haul flight”. He added: “The vaccines are safe, andyou want to have the Pfizer vaccine or Moderna vaccine instead then that is fine. “Covid is a horrible disease and long Covid affects people in their s just as much it seems as any other age group and can have debilitating side effects that essentially ruin your le.”  The King’s estimate of R is lower than official estimates had assumed amid increasing signs Government scientists are unsure how to measure true infections now many are immune. SAGE is putting the R for England at . to  last Friday but was unable to agree an R value for the UK. It had put the UK R range at . to . the previous week. The King’s research comes from its popular ZOE COVID Symptom Tracker app based on around one million weekly reporters and the proportion of newly symptomatic users who have positive swab tests.

There are four known forces of physics that supposedly govern the behaviour of every particle and planet but experts have long suspected there must be more. And in an experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago, scientists may have discovered a fth force after tiny particles known as muons were found to wobble at faster rates than expected. Here, particle physicist Dr Harry Clf, left, who was not involved in the Muon g- study, explains what the excitement is all about. Four forces of nature  Gravity holds the universe together and keeps our feet on the ground.Electromagnetic force is responsible for electricity, magnetism, light, radio waves, and holds atoms together. The strong force holds quarks at the nucleus of an atom together and the weak force causes radioactive decay and also transforms particles.What are muons There are three particles that make up everything we see in the universe – electrons and the up and down quarks .And for reasons we don’t understand there are also exotic fundamental particles, one of which is the muon.It is an unstable copy of the electron but only lives for about a millionth of a second and it’s  times heavier.What happened at Fermi  The purpose of the experiment was to measure the magnetic strength of the muon. It didn’t agree with the precise calculation made using current theories and this means there’s something  affecting the muon’s behaviour , which could be a new force of nature.Why does it matter This discovery could point towards an explanation to unanswered questions – why is the universe here, what is it made of, what is dark matter made of.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch described the departure from Birmingham Airport to the Spanish island of Majorca with  passengers on board as a serious incident.An update to the airlineaposs reservation system while its planes were grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic led to  passengers on the flight being allocated a childaposs standard weight of kg as opposed to the correct figure of kg.This caused the load sheet - produced for the captain to calculate what inputs are needed for take-off - to state that the Boeing  was more than ,kg lighter than it actually was. Investigators described the glitch as a simple flaw in an IT system. It was programmed in an unnamed foreign country where the title Miss is used for a child and Ms for an adult female. Despite the issue, the thrust used for the departure from Birmingham on July  last year was only marginally less than it should have been, and the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised, the AAIB said. The same fault caused two other TUI flights to take off from the UK with inaccurate load sheets later that day.  The system was adapted when the problem was first identied  days earlier, but this did not correct the weight entries for the July  flights. The operator subsequently introduced manual checks to ensure adult females were referred to as Ms on relevant documentation.

However – and this is going to be an extremely unpopular opinion – I think we should forget about holidays abroad this year. Take them off the table totally. Short term pain for long term gain. They’re just not worth it. As we have learnt, always in the hardest, cruellest way possible, this virus doesn’t care about dates, tradition, celebrations, or the way we enjoy living our lives. This virus loves travel. That’s how it spreads. And spreading, mutating, being sly and sneaky, working full pelt to outsmart us is its raison d’etre. Even now, more than a year into the pandemic, so much is still unknown. There are probably already new iants out there, as yet undetected. There still isn’t enough financial support for people being asked to quarantine, which means for some it will simply be impossible to. All this is a recipe for disaster. Since the start of this crisis, we’ve constantly been on the back foot, frantically trying to catch up with – never mind get ahead of - the virus. Now, for the first timeit feels like we are in a strong position.  We’re – dare I say it  – winning the battle. Every other time we’ve come anywhere close to this position it’s been a case of two steps forward, , back. Please, please, let’s not risk that happening again. Of course we need to look at tourists coming into the UK too. All it takes is for a strong new iant to be imported back into the UK, which proves to be immune to the vaccine, and we are right back to square one. All our leaps forward, the incredible inoculation rollout, rendered useless. It will be like going back, in a time machine, to the beginning of this nightmare, but knowing what we know now. Exhausted, bereaved, devastated, ruined, depressed, and unable to believe that it will be over in  weeks, because know the truth from the bitter experience of having lived it.

She has called on the government to change the law for elderly drivers, to ensure they are fit to drive. “What makes it even harder to come to terms with is that his death was so unnecessary, she said. “However, what’s more important is that they should be able to prove they are not a danger to the public so other families don’t have to suffer the heartache we have because of Simon’s death. She added that while it is wrong to label elderly drivers as a danger, it is vital other road users feel safe.MacKie, of Cherry Croft, Wick, was too frail to stand trial himself before being sentenced on March , reports the BBC.

The property was one of thousands of aposNissen hutsapos erected in Britain during war-time using pre-fabricated sections. It features distinctive curved roofs clad with corrugated sheets. Many were abandoned or used as storage by farmers. But one hangar, set in the countryside near Dunmow, Essex, has been converted into a private home boasting . acres of gardens. The building, which is one of three surviving Nissen huts situated on the grounds of an old Georgian house near Dunmow, was once used to house service personnel, including members of the RAF and American forces. Now, in keeping with its original shape and structure, it has been converted into a two-storey, five-bedroom property, with a lt to the upper floor and two bedrooms. The home, being sold through estates agents Savills, boasts a large open plan kitchen downstairs with three further bedrooms. Bi-folding doors extend onto a terrace with views across the countryside. Karl Manning, the agent handling the property on behalf of Savills, said: Itaposs certainly a unique building.  You look at the outside of it and you feel like it just shouldnapost really work as a home. But when you go inside, the curved back wall, which has been converted in the style of how it would have looked originally, is really quite impressive. Itaposs kept its original shape, structure and footprint, too. Karl said that the former hangar, along with its two other counterparts beside it, were converted around two or three years ago. The three huts sit just seven miles from the former RAF site, RAF Great Dunmow, which was in use from -.  Karl added: These huts were formerly used as lodgings for service personnel, and then after the war a lot of them became used for storage. But because of the size of these three huts, they were converted about two or three years ago. The other two huts are also currently lived in. Karl said this particular property has been on the market for around three weeks - and there has already been signicant interest in it. The Savills website reads: The property is approached over a substantial shingle drive opening to a natural stone terrace.

In the clip she said: If youaposve ever felt super anxious when youaposre hungover, then donapost worry a lot of people do. Hangxiety is a real thing caused by real chemical changes in your brain. When you drink chemicals in your brain are affected, namely glutamate and GABA. These normally have opposing effects on the brain, glutamate making it more active and GABA making it less active. She continued: Drinking alcohol simultaneously increases the amount of chill GAMA we have whilst decreasing the amount of wired glutamate. This means your brain is acting super slow-mo, giving you slower reactions and lower inhibitions. The morning after, your brain tries to rebalance. It becomes super sensitive to glutamate, which makes it hyperactive and you anxious, whilst becoming less sensitive to GABA which would normally step in and chill you out. Itaposs basically the reverse of what was happening while you were drinking and is a recipe for anxiety.  Sophie went on to reassure people that they shouldnapost stress that everyone low key hates them the next day and theyaposre not embarrassing - theyaposre just a bit chemically imbalanced. Experts agree that aposhangxietyapos is a real thing.Liz Burns, who is a lecturer of mental health nursing at Salford University with a specialism in alcohol services, has previously spoken to The Manchester Evening News all about it.She said: Feeling anxious the next day is down to the interaction of chemical compound glutamate. We may feel fearful because we canapost remember everything that happened the night before itaposs not at the forefront of the mind. We may be able to piece together moments, and memories can sometimes come back to us when weaposre stimulated by something.

If youaposre lucky, nothing ever comes of it. But sometimes, it comes back to bite you on the backside. For example, when you go to get your passport photo taken but decided to wear your hair up for it In this case, it ended up with a woman receiving a rather baffling passport photo - where staff had photoshopped her hair out. TikTok user Katie was left doubled over in laughter -but also feeling fairly mortied, after her photos came back - with her bun bluntly removed. Instead of asking her to take her hair down, staff had simply edited it out, leaving her looking unrecognisable to her friends and family. She shared a video explaining what happened and itaposs gone viral on TikTok. In it, Katie wrote: Wore a bun to get my passport pictures but they said it was too big so they just had to cut it off. The video has been viewed more than , times on TikTok.

Chilling footage shows the huge monitor lizard inside the -Eleven store in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. The massive reptile had climbed out of a nearby canal before crawling into the shop. Horried witness Narumpa Tangsin, who filmed the scene, said he was scared about going near the lizard, which he said could be dangerousit became angry. He said: I only stopped at the shop to buy some food and then saw the huge monitor lizard inside. I wanted to buy a drink but the animal was too close to the drinks aisle. Theyaposre dangerous animals, especially when theyaposre angry, so I stayed back and recorded it on my phone. I guess that shops have everything, even for lizards. Staff and customers hid behind the counter while the beast climbed onto shelves and tossed several cartons of milk onto the ground. A worried shop assistant called the police who arrived with reptile handlers to snare the ferocious monitor lizard shortly after lunchtime yesterday.

weighing in with goals and being hailed “a real success story” by his boss # it’s been a season to remember for Dundee United wide man Adrian Sporle.The Argentine ace has cemented himself in United gaffer Micky Mellon’s plans, scoring four times in  appearances in tangerine this term.Mellon believes there’s more to come from the -year-old, though, and has challenged him to kick on between now and the end of the campaign.With the Terrors still fighting on two fronts, starting their Premiership bottom-six journey at Hamilton on Saturday and with Forfar to face in the Scottish Cup, Mellon reckons they’ve plenty room for improvement.“Adrian has been a real success story for us this season,” he said.“It was new to him this season, he’s not played at this level before in the Premiership so he’s had to learn about himself as things went along.“He’s had to show he’s capable of stepping up and he’s one of the ones who has done that.“He’s attacked what he’s been asked to do and has had an impact in the games he’s played.“I still believe he can get better and better, there is still a lot of potential there waiting to be unlocked.“Like with the rest of him, I’ve told him to aim high, be tough on himself and he can keep improving.“He’s a great lad with a great attitude, he’s well-liked within the group so everyone has been delighted to see him do well.“He expects to keep doing better and that will help him because every day he’s working hard to get better.”It’s been far from plain sailing for Sporle to get to this point, however.Thousands of miles away from home amid the global coronavirus pandemic, he’s had to adapt to a new city and country as well as rise to the challenge of playing in the top flight.With the recent arrival of girlfriend Sofia to Dundee and the support of his team-mates, it’s made le easier for the Argentine – and it’s showing on the pitch.Mellon empathises with his wing wizard as he revealed his own struggle with being away from family and friends.The Tannadice boss praised Sporle for the way he has coped with the upheaval and believes football has played a huge role in helping him get through.“It has been challenging for everyone over

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay across the North East, and I know this must be a really dficult time for the  members of staff.#I hope that a solution can be found that will allow John Lewis to maintain a presence in the city.#The Covid pandemic and its accompanying restrictions have accelerated problems that already existed for retail and our town centres.#Aberdeen has also been hit worse than most, with a collapse in oil prices and a business rates system that takes far more than it gives.#The truth is that the SNP government hasn’t given the region the attention it deserves.#That#s why I launched a campaign last week for a fair share for the north-east, including a £ billion regional enterprise agency, upgrades to key infrastructure, and rolling out broadband far faster than the SNP.#“Our high streets have been decimated through the pandemic and the loss of John Lewis is a terrible blow for Aberdeen city centre, its employees and customers.“Scottish Labour is a pro-business party and is committed to launching a Business Network to establish solid relations with employers across the country.“City centre businesses will be vital in rebuilding our economy. We will focus on jobs and retail to help kick start our post-pandemic recovery, and ensure our high streets thrive once more.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: #The closure of John Lewis leaves a major hole in the middle of Aberdeen. We are determined to build a strong and flourishing economy in the North East so that we can sustain international brands like John Lewis in the city.“In the recent Scottish budget the Scottish Liberal Democrats secured £m for transition training specically for the North East boost the economy and new industries.#Under Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals, we will reform business rates to take the burden off high street retailers and give those shops the ability to compete with online retailers.#We will also give local authorities more powers to get to reshape their city and town centres into vibrant and flourishing places that people want to visit, spend money and set up shop.#“The John Lewis closure is devastating news for the workers and it shows how we really need to rethink our high streets after the pandemic, to make them more resilient and focused on the communities that live in and rely on them.#If we want our town centres to thrive, we need attractive public urban spaces that people want to spend time in.#This means levelling the playing field for independent shops, cooperatives like John Lewis and for community spaces, and stop giving tax-dodging online retailers incentives and tax breaks.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/421fecda-9bd3-449a-9c71-e2dda22afe2d-852x564.jpg ","title":"public voice support for campaign to save aberdeens john lewis store","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThousands of members of the public have voiced their support for a campaign to keep the north#s last department store in Aberdeen.Last week John Lewis announced it plans to close its store on George Street # the UK#s most northern outlet and the only one in Scotland outside the central belt.It follows the closure of Debenhams, which has closed its stores in both Aberdeen and Inverness.The announcement sparked outrage from shoppers and members of the public in the north-east, with thousands of people aiming to convince the retail giant to reconsider.Two petitions have been set up, with a combined total of more than , people signing in support of the campaign.Many also added comments sharing why they want the partnership to stay in the Granite City.Chris Cusack described the store as #an important fixture in the city centre, and an essential part of its retail economy#, while Alison Murray claimed the region would be #bereft#the closure goes ahead.Dawn Allen said: #We desperately need to preserve the jobs and it is a three-hour drive to the next nearest store. Aberdeenshire needs John Lewis, not just the city itself.#And Karen Young added: #I worked in John Lewis for years and it was the best store in town. I think this will be a terrible loss to Aberdeen and it breaks my heart that those amazing staff will no longer do the jobs they live and are committed to.#A taskforce, including council chiefs and business leaders, held talks earlier this week with senior management at John Lewis.The campaign to save the store has also been backed by candidates standing in Aberdeen Central in the upcoming Scottish Parliament election.Scottish Labour candidate Barry Black, who set up one of the petitions calling for the closure decision to be reversed, said: #There is a mixture of anger and huge disappointment at the decision. This is the last department store in Aberdeen.#People do have confidence in the future of Aberdeen city centre but they see John Lewis as a huge part of that future. It#s the anchor of that side of the city centre, and there are a lot of retailers in George Street who have grave concerns because of the people it draws to that part of town.#This is much bigger than Aberdeen city. To the public in Aberdeenshire, Moray, the Highlands and even Orkney and Shetland, it#s their local department store.#Douglas Lumsden, the Scottish Conservative candidate, said: #I haven#t seen a public response like this for a long time. It just shows what this means to so many people, and it#s so important to the whole region.#If it does go it will be a devastating loss to the whole city.#Kevin Stewart of the SNP and: “I know from my mailbag and inbox that Aberdonians want John Lewis to stay in our city and I do hope that the John Lewis board will recognise this strength of feeling and agree to maintain a presence in our city.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/hollies_press_001-740x564.jpg ","title":"the hollies head to aberdeens music hall to celebrate their 60th anniversary","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remIconic British band The Hollies will celebrate their th anniversary with a gig in Aberdeen.Celebrated as one of the most influential bands of the s, alongside the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, they will play at the Music Hall on June  next year.#‘We felt like this is something no other band gets to do, celebrate six decades together,  years of this band and these songs means so much to us and so many others,” said Tony Hicks, the band’s original guitar player.The Hollies had originally planned to tour this autumn, but pushed it back next year in order to mark their big anniversary.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In  my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died. Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

Seeds were planted, nurtured and potted on. Plants were lted, ided and begged to thrive.A couple of SCIO members had the unenviable task of separating and folding thousands of raffle tickets # so much fun.And so to the day. Would all that effort be worth it  Would anyone come  Would we be able to raise even more money The answer, of course, was yes. The turnout was amazing, way beyond expectation. Everyone adhered to the face mask and no huggingrules but the smiles as people greeted their friends and neighbours could not be hidden despite the masks.Watching the kids running round looking for Easter eggs and the Golden Egg to win the giant bunny was a joy to see.Everyone attending waited patiently in the queues at all the stalls and no one minded because the sun shone. What a glorious day.All the baking and planting and coaxing donations and ticket sales, the sore feet when it was all over were worth every minute.Overall we raised a magnicent £,.From everyone on the SCIO to all the Furnace folk and friends #  thank you.

United Kingdom and the European Union emphasised that the benefits of receiving the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks for most people.After the European agencyrsquos declaration, Australian drug

vaccine and the risk of side effects was remote. He said the change was being made out of an abundance of caution.The pivot represents a signicant sht in Australiarsquos overall approach and is likely to delay plans to have every person in the country inoculated by October.A major part of Australiarsquos strategy had been the ability to make its own vaccines at home and not rely on shipments from abroad.Our CEO, @AlbertBourlasharing #Covidvaccine manufacturing updates from our Kalamazoo, Michigan site after @POTUSstopped by. #ScienceWillWincc:@WHCOVIDResponseWatch here # pic BNRFhAsTUSmdash Pfizer Inc.February , It had planned to manufacture some  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for  million people.

Thank you for supporting us during this incredibly challenging time.With regard to Mr Wilson#s letter, entitled #mishmash of worn out tropes#, published in the March  edition of the Courier, my initial reaction was not to conduct a political diatribe within the pages of the local paper my thoughts were that I would let others decide whose letter is more appropriate.However, on reflection, I decided to reply to the comments relating to my vaccine observations in which he states that for me #to denigrate the EU vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic#, followed by #our success is an illusion until both doses are administered#, and therefore I am accused of not only #crowing about vaccines# but of being presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Wilson has a total misunderstanding of who I am and what my beliefs are. I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me. I felt like I could play for  minutes instead of .#I am not sure I would have made it, but I gave it a try, and can say I played alongside John McGovern, a future two-time European Cup winner.

People were also forced to gather in evacuation shelters, making it harder to physically distance.A collection being carried out by A#Chleit, Clachan and Gigha churches will be sent to the WDP committee which has projects in Vanuatu to help with the aftermath of the most recent disasters.Everybody who participated in the service was given a bookmark to remind them of the country and its people.TARBERT:Organisers of Tarbert Seafood Festival have cancelled this year#s festival in light of ongoing Covid- restrictions around mass gatherings.The  festival was due to have been held over two days from July .While this news will likely disappoint the hundreds of people who flock to Tarbert for this popular, family-friendly weekend, the news is not all bad as organisers are confident this year#s Tarbert Music Festival will go ahead as planned from September  to .John Hardie of Tarbert Enterprise Company said: #While the recent announcement from the Scottish Government on the roadmap out of lockdown, together with the fantastic work being done by the NHS with its vaccine roll-out is encouraging, unfortunately it wasn#t enough to allow us to hold this year#s seafood festival safely.#Evenwe are in tier zero, as is hoped, by the end of June, restrictions on numbers of people attending mass gatherings will still apply. The festival is one of Scotland#s friendliest festivals with friends meeting up, milling around our many stalls and enjoying a drink in the sun while listening to live music, not to mention sampling some of the best seafood in the country.#This atmosphere is not something we could compromise for , but the  Tarbert Seafood Festival will certainly be an event worth waiting for.#He added: #We very much look forward to meeting friends, old and new, in September for this year#s music festival.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.

For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

Traffic management will remain in place  hours a day during footpath improvement operations.In order to carry out the footpath improvements works at Hall Street, some parking restrictions will be required, however, access to businesses and properties located on the street will be maintained for pedestrians, with only minimal disruption, to ensure public safety.The safety of maintenance workers remains #a top priority# during this project and strict physical distancing protocols, in line with Scottish Government guidance, will be in place to ensure all on-site personnel remain safe throughout the duration of the project.Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly welcomed news of the plan which will be finalised after the consultation period ends.

I went to school one year and Jock came the next year.#The pair went on to become two of the best known names in Scottish golf, Belle through her success on the course and Jock through his coverage of the sport.Jock interviewed Belle from time-to-time before her retirement in the mid-s.She said: #When he interviewed me, he would say, #Before we start, any news of home # He took the name of Dunaverty and publicised it worldwide.#When I was on the way up, people would say, #Dunaverty, where#s that # and I#d say, #Paul McCartney, Mull of Kintyre, you know # I used to say that between Paul McCartney, Mull of Kintyre and Jock MacVicar, we got Dunaverty on the map.#A Dunaverty Golf Club spokesperson said: #Everyone at Dunaverty Golf Club is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of our honorary member and dear friend Jock MacVicar. Jock was a great supporter of Dunaverty and spread the word of our fantastic course around the world. Our thoughts are with Jock#s family and friends.#Belle added: #Jock was very well respected in the industry. He had a lovely way –somebody said something in frustration when they came off the golf course, mad at themselves, something that could maybe be twisted another way from what was intended, Jock never crossed the line of doing that.#If he did have a wee criticism of somebody, he always found the nicest possible way to say it. He had a nice way with words and a nice way with people.#The week he died, Jock took part in an interview about The Masters, one of the four major championships in professional golf, which began this week.#It was in connection with Scotland#s interest in Robert MacIntyre from Oban,# Belle said. #Jock was fiercely proud of the fact, I think, that he could mention Kintyre and Oban.#It#s a pleasure to have known him all those years and, for me, it was a wee link with Kintyre too.#Although Jock lived in Glasgow, he kept coming back to Kintyre to see his family and friends, so he obviously enjoyed being here.#Jock came from a line of renowned MacVicars from Southend. As well as writing for the Campbeltown Courier, his father Angus was a prolic author in a number of genres, including crime thrillers, juvenile science fiction, and autobiography.

Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"musicians-impress-judges-online-bagpipe-competition","story":"Pupils

Facebook, with thousands of viewers getting a chance to vote for their favourite, in addition to the official judges.Alex Duncan, of the SSPDT, said: ldquoThis was not just a musical challenge on the part of pupils, but a technical feat on the part of tutors.ldquoPupils had to practise solo and film their inidual part, in time and in tune, in their own home, after which tutors had to combine all the pupilsrsquo films into one performance using technical mixing s.Craig Munro, one of the world-famous Red Hot Chilli Pipers and a judge, said: ldquoLine-ups included keyboard, voice, guitar, violin or anything ndash so long as at least two bagpipes were at the heart of it. We were blown away by the talent of the young people and it was hard to choose the winners.Fellow judges were Finlay MacDonald, director of piping at the National Piping Centre, along with composer, broadcaster and musician Gary Innes.Prizes totalling pound, were awarded to the winners.The SSPDT helps expand piping and drumming in Scotlandrsquos state schools, with cash grants for tuition.

We all know an insatiable Labrador .Labradors will devour everything they can get hold of. Some breeds are more picky and highly unlikely to eat anything other than a tasty morsel.There are some toy breed owners who would love their pet to eat a hearty meal every now and then.This is something to consider when buying a pup.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, behaviours, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.There are seven main classes of dog, each with their own characteristics. These are only guidelines and all dogs have their own characteristics.Border collies are generally very agile and not especially food-orientated ndash but recently, our receptionist Adele took an interesting call at our Dunedin Vets Tranent surgery, from Mrs Jane Green.She had been playing on the beach at North Berwick with her dog Zed, an exuberant -month-old Border collie. They had been having great fun on a dry, sunny morning when suddenly the ball she threw for Zed disappeared.Mrs Green was convinced Zed had swallowed it whole. There appeared to be no other explanation for the disappearing ball.Adele advised her to come to the surgery as soon as possible after ascertaining that Zed wasnrsquot choking.I have seen cases where hard balls have become lodged in dogsrsquo throats, cutting off the air supply and literally choking the dog. Always make sure the ball your dog is playing with is large enough not to lodge in their airway.Zed wasnrsquot choking and seemed remarkably bright.When he arrived at the surgery, Zed was examined by vet Rachel.She discussed the case with Mrs Green. Rachel could not feel the ball when she felt Zacrsquos abdomen, but Mrs Green was sure he had swallowed it and she showed Rachel a similar one, which was certainly too large to pass through his intestines.At this point, as vets we have to decide how to determineZed had indeed swallowed a ball, so we look to diagnostic imaging. The first thing we may consider is radiography.Only a few years ago,vets wanted to visualise the internal structures of your petrsquos body, a radiograph would be taken using an x-ray machine, which showed the image on a piece of photographic-type paper.The radiograph had to be processed manually in a dark room, using noxious chemicals, and it could take about  minutes to develop one plate.If several radiographs were required, the pet would be under anaesthetic for a prolonged period of time. Pets require sedation or general anaesthetic for radiographs to be taken.The patient has to be positioned correctly and be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken. This ensures the best image possible is produced at the first attempt and ensures minimal radiation exposure.Nowadays, we have digital x-rays. The patient still has to be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken but the processing is complete in under one minute.The images appear on a computer screen and can be viewed from dferent angles and intensities as required. Fewer radiographs need to be taken and patients are anaesthetised for much shorter times.After light sedation, Zed lay still to have his x-ray taken. This confirmed the ball was in his stomach, with the dense squeaker clearly visible.After discussion with Mrs Green, Zed went for surgery. Vet Rachel, with nurse Jenny, the anaesthetist, performed an exploratory operation to locate and remove the ball.With careful surgical skill, Rachel removed the ball from Zedrsquos stomach and checked to ensure there were no other foreign objects or damage to Zedrsquos intestinal tract.It would not be the first time that one object has been removed, only to find something  in the intestines as well!She closed the wound and Jenny monitored Zed as he recovered. He was given intravenous fluid, pain relief and antibiotics to ensure good recovery and stop infection after his operation.Once he was awake and stable, he was transferred to our out-of-hours carers at the Braids Veterinary Hospital, where he was monitored constantly until he was allowed home the following day.Zed has been examined by several vets at Dunedin Vets since hishome and, although at first quite tender and not his normal happy self, he is improving and should be back to his lively, bouncy self pretty soon.Please ensure you do not give your pets items to play with that they could swallow. They are not aware of the consequencesthey do and they may not all be as lucky as Zed."},{"url":null,"title":"dirleton-tantallon-castles-among-attractions-aiming-reopen-month","story":"The National Trust for Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland have shared plans for opening Newhailes House in Musselburgh, Preston Mill at East Linton, and Dirleton and Tantallon Castles from April  onwards, providing Scotland continues to progress out of lockdown.The grounds at Newhailes and Inveresk Lodge Garden have been accessible for exercise all through the winter.The National Trust for Scotlandhas confirmed that most of its built heritage, as well as estates and gardens across Edinburgh and the Lothians, will be open for visitors from the end of April.Historic Environment Scotlandhas said it plans to open  of its staffed sites on the same day, with more reopening on a phased basis over the coming months.All visits to Dirleton and Tantallon Castles, alongside HESrsquo other sites, must be booked in advance.Social distancing measures will be in place, as will a one-way system in some locations and contactless payments where possible.Parts of some sites, such as indoor or enclosed spaces, will be closed and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Other sites will be reopened on a phased basis over the coming months.For more information visit historicenvironment.scot our-reopening-plans-and-covid--responseNTS is urging anyone planning to visit to check the latest opening information at nts.org.uk before travelling, as some properties have dferent opening patterns this summer.

He had a love spot on his forehead,anyone saw it theyrsquod fall in love with him.ldquoHandy, said Finn, amused by the idea.ldquoWell not always, so he kept it hidden under his long hair. But Grainne was smitten by him and so she had a plan.ldquoShe put a sleeping potion in Fionnrsquos drink and the drinks of others, then placed a sacred oath on Diarmuid so he had to go with her. They fled as Fionn slept. When he awoke he was enraged at the betrayal. He vowed revenge and hunted for them for many years.ldquoWait a minute, said her nephew. ldquoFionn didnrsquot love her did he  I mean they hadnrsquot met until then, so why was he so angry : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoHe saw it as a betrayal. Diarmuid had been one of Fionnrsquos closest friends now hersquod run off with the woman he was due to marry.ldquoBut she didnrsquot want to marry Fionn anyway.ldquoIt was the way of things in those days, women had no choice in who to marry. Thatrsquos why I like Grainne, she refused to accept it and ran off with the man she did love. She defied the greatest warrior that had lived as well as convention. There are many stories about her travels with Diarmuid, places they hid, the adventures they had. All this time Fionn was searching for them. When he finally found them, the years seemed to have softened his anger and they made peace.ldquoSo it was a happy ending then  I canrsquot see the connection to the name of this place, though, said Finn.ldquoThe tale is not finished. Izzy stopped walking to explain what happened next.: Chapter  of Tims BookldquoYou see, the way Fionn felt inside was not the way it showed on the outside. Bitterness still festered under the surface and it showed itself when he went hunting with Diarmuid and the other warriors of the Fianna.ldquoDuring the hunt, Diarmuid was attacked by a wild boar. A prophesy had told that he would be killed by a boar and the beast savaged him. He managed to kill it, but Diarmuid lay mortally wounded.ldquoThere was one chance to save him. If Fionn gave Diarmuid water to drink from his hands, his magical powers would save his le.ldquoAh, because of his magic thumb  wondered Finn.ldquoAye, well remembered Finn. There was no time to lose. Fionn rushed to a nearby burn, cupped his hands and brought water to the dying Diarmuid. But then...Izzy put her hand on her heart.ldquoThen what  her nephew asked, spreading out his arms in a questioning gesture.ldquoFionnrsquos anger and vengeance ed. He couldnrsquot forgive Diarmuid for his betrayal. So he deliberately let the water seep through his fingers.ldquoBut Fionnrsquos emotions were conflicting and when he saw Diarmuid dying on the ground his bitterness eased, and he ran back to the burn to collect water. But, as before, he let the water drain from his hands because, in the last moment, he still couldnrsquot forgive.: Chapter  of Tims BookIzzy began walking.ldquoSo he leaves Diarmuid to die  asked Finn, catching up with his aunt.She paused again.ldquoHis warriors, including Fionnrsquos own son Ossian, begged him to give Diarmuid water. They were all loyal to him, but they also loved Diarmuid. They had all suffered from the split between to two men they both loved.ldquoSo for a third time, Fionn ed to the burn. He walked carefully with the water in his hands. Memories of his old friendship flooded his mind. An understanding grew in him of the power of Grainnersquos love for Diarmuid and how dficult it had been for them. Fionn felt his bitterness and anger finally dissolve he could now forgive.ldquoHe knelt down by Diarmuid and carefully trickled the water onto his lips. But it was just too late.ldquoHe was dead Izzy nodded. Finn walked on, saying nothing.: Chapter  of Tims BookThey had reached the part of the trail where tall planted pine trees grew. There was the faint sound of running water below on their right and Izzy led Finn down a small path that zigzagged steeply down a slope.They reached a burn which tumbled down the glen, with native trees lining its banks.Izzy paused by a hazel tree that leaned over the burn to catch the sunlight. Finn arrived with a thoughtful look on his face.ldquoSo that story is how Creag an Tuirc got its name  he asked.Izzy was looking for hazelnuts, so she spoke as she knelt down and foraged.ldquoNobody knows for sure how it got its name. The tale of Grainne and Diarmuid is actually an ancient legend from Ireland, but legends and stories are carried by people and planted in new places.She stood up happy, holding a hazelnut between her thumb and finger. She put it in her pocket and looked at her nephew.ldquoThere was a shared culture and language here with Ireland. Creag na Tuirc was named in Gaelic in the mists of time. Was the story of Diarmuidrsquos death told here round the fireside  For sure it was. Was the rock named to give the tale a local setting  I like to think itrsquos possible. There are lots of places in the Highlands named after these old Celtic legends. Therersquos a place called Tor an Tuirc which means hill of the boar, near Oban, and close by there is a standing stone called Diarmuidrsquos pillar. Local people said it was where he was buried. So the stories were planted here many years ago and now have roots here too. In fact, just up the road there is what tradition says is Fionnrsquos grave.ldquoReally! Aw can we go there aunty, please : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoOf course, we might even be able to see it later today, Izzy assured him.She continued her search for hazelnuts and Finn helped, but they found no more.ldquoIrsquod hoped to find nine, explained his aunt.ldquoWhy nine ldquoIrsquoll tell you later, in a story, Izzy smiled.Finn was quiet as they walked down the path by the tumbling water. Suddenly, he recognised where he was: the waterfall theyrsquod passed earlier.ldquoYou stay here and enjoy the falls, Irsquoll meet you at Rob Royrsquos grave, said Izzy as she wandered back to Balquhidder Kirk.: Chapter  of Tims BookFinn stayed a while longer, watching the water cascade over the rocks. The sound soothed him and the damp coolness of the air was welcome in what was becoming a very warm day.He eventually walked back to the kirk and emerged from the shade of the trees to see his aunt talking to a man. They broke off their conversation as soon as they saw Finn and the man walked briskly away out of the kirkyard.ldquoJust a tourist asking about Rob Roy, she explained when she saw Finnrsquos inquisitive expression.Two women then arrived.ldquoDo you know where Rob Royrsquos grave is  they asked Finn. He smiled and pointed at it.ldquoCould you take our photo please  they asked.They stood by the graveside with their thumbs up as Finn clicked a couple of times to make sure. Finn was keen to explain the mystery of the grave but they didnrsquot linger. The women thanked him and left, happy theyrsquod got their photo.As they drove away, Finn noticed the other car parked in the small parking space.He was sure it was the same car which had been parked in the layby by Samsonrsquos Stone the day before. But he thought no more of it, as his stomach began to tell him it was time for some proper food.He looked for his aunt. She was in the th-century kirk, looking at a stone with a carving of a person on it.ldquoIrsquom hungry, can we go for lunch  Finn asked.ldquoSure.They walked back to the car through the wood and past the waterfall once again.On the way, Izzy pointed out the grave of Robert Kirkrsquos we, who had died young, and the faerie hill on the northern edge of the kirkyard.It was midday and the sky was almost a Mediterranean blue.They left Balquhidder and drove towards Kingshouse at the east of the glen, which was originally built to accommodate British army officers using the military road.Balquhidder had seen its share of Redcoat atrocities in the aftermath of Culloden in , as many MacLarens had come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie.The military road had been built to make transport of the military easier, and to supply the many British army forts located in the Highlands, which were garrisoned to keep an eye on potential Jacobite trouble.As they drove out of the glen towards Loch Earn, Izzy told the tale of Capt Donald MacLaren.He had joined the Jacobites during the rising of . He was wounded and captured, then taken on a journey to England for execution. But he managed to escape while passing a place called the Devilrsquos Beef Tub in the south of Scotland, and one tradition says he ed to Balquhidder and lived many years in disguise as a woman, despite being heavily built.She told it in a funny way and Finn laughed at the image of this big bearded man dressed as a woman fooling the soldiers.ldquoHow can you remember all these stories  he asked.ldquoI remember the pictures they paint in my imagination, replied Izzy.ldquoMaybe I sometimes get some of the details wrong but for me they are portraits in my head and so when I tell the story I just describe what I see. Thatrsquos the way I remember anyway.Finn understood what she meant. Her stories had helped him paint his own portraits in his head.He was silent for a while as Izzy drove, then said: ldquoI want to phone my mum.ldquoOf course sweetie, letrsquos find a phone box and seeshersquos free.Izzy felt a wave of anxiety. She was worried that Finn might have recognised who she had been talking to at Balquhidder.

car park was also full by the middle of the day, although at all other times there were spaces at these.Even on the very busiest days, the car parks at the sports centre and the high school were virtually empty, and the car parks of Tesco and Aldi also had spare capacity.No one can expect to be able to park where they want, when they want, for as long as they want, all at no cost.Building more car parks is not viable.The only sites proposed are ones where any other form of development would not be tolerated.Any gain for drivers would be small compared to the loss of amenity, and any parking created would not be adequate.The solution is to use the parking resources that we have more efficiently.If you have an errand which requires a car, avoid lunchtime.Your best bet is to get in and out before am.If you can manage your trip to town without using a car, walk or cycle instead.On the really busy beach days, we need to do more than leave matters to first-come first-served.Even good signage, although helpful, will not solve the problem alone.Anyone who recalls the traffic gridlock on Marine Parade last year will know that what is required is some active traffic management: closing the road to the Haugh car park when it is full, and having helpful and friendly guides at Marine Parade and where directing visitors to the places they might find a place to park firstly to the Rec or the station and, once those car parks are full, to the school and the sports centre.Robbie Wightman,Clford Road,North

We There Yet  The Year-Long Adventure That Kept On Giving.He said: ldquoThere is a word for being a travel addict, which is lsquodromomaniarsquo.ldquoWe are dromomaniacs and once you let the genie out of the bottle you can never get it back again.ldquoIt changes your outlook on le, not just travel.The family, from Dunbar, had been on a package holiday in Turkey when they first had the idea of travelling the world.Ian, who was HR director at Jewel and Esk College, and we Anne, who is a dietician, had asked their children where they wanted to go next on holiday.Rory, now , and Roonagh, now , produced a list of  countries, with the family looking into whether an around-the-world ticket existed.By the summer of , they were ready to get their passports out and leave Dunbar behind.Ian, , told the Courier that family and friends gave the news a mixed reaction.He said: ldquoConfusion, disbelief, lsquoare you madrsquo, concern and, for some, jealousy but they saw it as a holiday and I know it was not.ldquoMost parents will understand going away with your kids for a couple of weeks and it is not always a holiday and you feel you need a holiday when you get back.ldquoImagine doing it for a year!ldquoIt is   family living and not on a holiday budget but a tight budget.ldquoWe really had to make money go far and save up for the big ticket items.ldquoYou get homesick and tired and ill, and all the things are part of the challenge of a year but are completely offset by amazing things you do, the people that you meet and the great weather.ldquoWhile Scotland was shivering, not just in the cold but in the middle of the last recession in early , we were splashing in the waves of the surf at Queensland in Australia.ldquoIt is not a hard luck story ndash we were very, very lucky to have done it but we created the opportunity for ourselves.The family started off in Cape Town ndash ldquoa city by the sea with an iconic mountain ndash before finishing  months later in Rio de Janeiro ndash ldquoa city by the sea with an iconic mountain.Along the way, they visited a number of countries, including Swaziland, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Peru.He said: ldquoThere were  days

Great Wall of China.ldquoThen, there was family time, the other  days, which was just as special.However, it was not a trip of five-star hotels and luxury, with the family staying in hostels and travelling overland to reach destinations.In a time before Kindle, Google Translate and Airbnb, it often meant learning about the next stop on the journey while they were travelling.Last year, Ian, who now runs his own outsourcing human resources and health and safety business, decided to start writing about his travels as ldquoa legacy project.Fittingly, a first draft of the book, which is now available on Amazon, took  days to complete.Positive feedback convinced him to push ahead with the story, which he hopes could inspire others to enjoy their own journeys.The family has very much

we could have done that dferently, longer or we did not have the time to do that.ldquoIt would be amazing to go back in time and redo some things.ldquoIt is also interesting to go back to places to

about , patients ndash which was making it ldquoreally hard for patients to get through on the phone and book an appointment.It comes as an online petition has been launched by patients calling for ldquourgent change.The number of call attempts to the practice, the largest in East Lothian, rose sharply in March after a period where the number of call attempts were slowly decreasing to pre-Covid- pandemic levels.The Riverside, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, said that the pattern of call attempts had changed too, as more calls were made at am to try and book an appointment, with a larger number of redials being seen.Dr Richard Fairclough, GP partner, said: ldquoWersquore looking at all of the data we get via our phone system as quickly as possible, so we can understand the full extent of the situation that we and the local community are facing.ldquoWersquore also trying to better quanty all the dferent reasons people call, so we can better understand how to best direct patients to other more appropriate health services, and to our online services.ldquoBut one thing is apparent: demand is completely outstripping the health systemrsquos capacity to meet that need, and there are more people needing an appointment than each appointment we have available. This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county. These services have been designed in partnership with local practices to deliver the GP contract and direct people to the right care from the right professional at the right time.ldquoThese have proved to be very popular with patients and we would urge people to think about referring themselves to these services without going to their GP

Eggs symbolise new le, and often appeared in pagan festivals celebrating spring.And for Christians, the egg symbolises the moment in the Bible when Jesus is resurrected after his crucixion.As the tradition evolved over the centuries, chocolate versions of eggs became more popular as gts for children than real eggs - for obvious reasons.The first chocolate eggs appeared in France and Germany during the th century, but they were bitter and hard.Yet as chocolate-making techniques began to improve, Cadbury produced the first modern chocolate Easter egg that we enjoy today in .The chocolatier used a pure cocoa butter that could be easily moulded into the smooth shape.Hollow chocolate Easter eggs quickly became popular, and they still remain a favourite Easter tradition with many around the world.A lot of people also give up chocolate for lent, so indulging in some chocolate eggs became a common way to mark the end of the Christian fasting period.As well as consuming chocolate eggs, there are other egg-related Easter traditions that are synonymous with the religious holiday.Rolling hard-boiled eggs is a favoured activity, and for Christians this is a symbolic re-enactment of when the stone was rolled away from Christrsquos tomb in the Bible.Painting and decorating hard-boiled eggs is also a beloved tradition that children especially enjoy.These two activities often go hand-in-hand, with children painting their eggs before finding a hill to roll them down until they crack.An Easter egg hunt is another popular tradition many take part in over the Christian weekend.Chocolate treats are hidden around the garden or the house, ready to be found by family members - and the winner is the person who finds more than anyone .The Easter bunny is said to arrive over the weekend, hiding eggs for when children wake up on Easter Sunday.There are numerous tales surrounding the origins of the Easter bunny.One is that the rabbit comes from the ancient pagan festival of Eostre, which honoured the goddess of fertility and spring.Her animal symbol is believed to have been a rabbit, which traditionally represents fertility.Meanwhile, in America, some people believe that the Easter bunny was introduced in the s by German immigrants in Pennsylvania.Their egg-laying hare, known as ldquoOsterhase or ldquoOschter Haws, was said to lay colorful eggs as gts to children who behaved well.The Easter bunnys egg delivery then evolved over time to include treats such as toys and chocolate."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-covid-vaccine-certificate-app-explored-lockdown-freedom","story":"Jeane Freeman said that ethical and equality questions would need to be kept under review ndash but added that she favours a digital certicate over a paper version to reduce any unnecessary burden on the NHS.Her comments came ahead of a Downing Street news conference later on Monday at which the Prime Minister is expected to set out further details on the planned certication scheme in England.Proposals were announced at the weekend for a ldquoCovid status certication scheme ndash dubbed ldquovaccine passports ndash for mass gatherings south of the border, from sporting events to nightclubs.The UK Government has said the certicates could be a mobile phone app or a paper document and they are expected to show whether an inidual has received the vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has ldquonatural immunity having tested positive in the previous six months.Ms Freeman told BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme there are ethical and equality questions over vaccine passports as not everyone can be inoculated.She also said there are questions over how the scheme would work.Ms Freeman said: ldquoWersquore currently looking at what would be the digital infrastructure you would need for any form of certication, as we work through those ethical and equality and practical questions about how it might be used and in what circumstances.ldquoI donrsquot want it to be paper ndash where itrsquos possible Irsquod want it to be digitally done.

in the Pentland Hills, while the source of South Esk is beyond Gladhouse Reservoir in the Moorfoot Hills.Both rivers flow northeast through wooded valleys rich in wildle, history, towns and villages, to their confluence at Watersrsquo Meet in Dalkeith Country Park.As one river, the Esk then flows through Musselburgh to the Firth of Forth.The first talk, on Thursday, April , at .pm, will be given

With so many families moving into the area, perhaps for the first time, there are places of great beauty and rich heritage to discover and to learn about through our talks and walks programmes.He added: ldquoThe last year has reminded us all of the importance of getting out into the open air to stretch the legs and relax the mind. The paths along the Esk valleys take you through beautul woodland, magnicent estates, sites of previous intense industry and places of great geological, biological and historical interest.ldquoTo walk these ways is to follow in the path of signicant figures of the Enlightenment, artists, poets and writers, industrialists of note and some great scientists, plus a few rogues.Mr Oldham added: ldquoNo rivers are without their problems and the Esks have their share. Some are legacies of the industrial past and others from more recent developments.

electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, theEast Lothian Courierwill give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan DavidsonEuan Davidson WHILST other parties have been bickering over the constitution, this week the Liberal Democrats have been concentrating on education.If Scotland is to recover to a stronger position post-pandemic then education will be at its heart.In , Nicola Sturgeon stated that we should judge her on her record of tackling the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students.Itrsquos fair to say on that score, the SNP Government has failed dismally.Even before the pandemic struck, progress had stalled completely with the worst figures for years.That was before the exam scandal last year, where the SNP were happy to see pupils from the most deprived areas impacted disproportionately until they had to bow to public pressure.My party has long campaigned for the introduction of extra funding for schools in deprived areas, which we introduced in Government at the UK level.We were eventually able to persuade the Scottish Government to introduce the attainment fund and we now want to see it expanded signicantly.In , it simply cannot be right that your le chances are still decided by your parentsrsquo economic circumstances.We also want to see an overhaul in the way we approach education as a society.The introduction of Curriculum for Excellence, whilst well meaning, was badly mismanaged by the SNP Government.Failures like this and the exam scandal show that much more faith needs to be put in our teachers and education professionals rather than Scottish Government ministers.Another priority for me is improving early years education.Evidence shows that a signicant proportion of a childrsquos le chances are decided early on.Thatrsquos why we want to delay formal schooling until age seven.The evidence from countries across Europe shows starting children with a more play-based, less formal approach, leaves them much more prepared for formal learning later on.Another referendum will do nothing to overcome the economic and social damage of the pandemic.To give our children a fair chance, we must focus on education and recovery.Craig HoyCraig Hoy THIS election is a straight choice: we can focus on recovery or another isive independence referendum.This week, I have spoken to many residents while on the campaign trail in areas including Dunbar, Garvald, Longniddry and Prestonpans.I recently conducted local surveys and produced a series of local manestos, which I hope you have received.As MSP I will focus on:My pledges dovetail with wide-ranging and ambitious plans outlined by Douglas Ross and the Scottish Conservatives during the first weeks of the campaign.We have announced a major drive to ensure young people can afford new homes.While East Lothian has seen thousands built, itrsquos shocking that many people seeking to buy their first home have to leave their home town to get a foot on the housing ladder.I am also committed to expanding local railways.On this issue, and on every issue, I wonrsquot just tell voters what they want to hear.Other candidates have talked about re-opening the old Haddington to Longniddry line.This solution is unworkable, putting at risk the much-loved railway walk.Instead, I have worked closely with rail experts to explore plans for a new UK Government-funded section of the East Coast Mainline, which could expand existing rail capacity at Dunbar and Prestonpans, delivering new edge-of-town stations at Haddington, Tranent and Blindwells.If we focus on recovery and not another referendum, these are the ambitious, job-creating policies we can deliver for East Lothian.I look forward to working with you as your MSP to achieving them.Paul McLennanPaul McLennan THIS week, Irsquove focused on helping to prepare East Lothian businesses to reopen during April.Throughout both lockdowns, East Lothian has demonstrated itself as adaptable, resourceful and committed to community wellbeing.Our residents have shown resilience, determination and neighbourly kindness.Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP have pioneered the visionary lsquowellbeing governmentrsquo in East Lothian, lsquowellbeing high streetsrsquo can hold the key to economic recovery as our new normal.We can increase support for -minute neighbourhoods, putting everything within easy reach, with traders already playing their part by prioritising local produce and reducing their carbon footprint.This underlies the SNP Governmentrsquos vision for lsquorenewing Scotlandrsquo post-pandemic, with the pound million Green Jobs fund mapping the environmentally sensitive economic recovery younger generations deserve and demand.Well-supported shop local initiatives have greatly expanded and Irsquom keen to extend this as East Lothian builds a strong recovery.The SNP Government boost of a poundm lsquoScotland Loves Localrsquo fund is encouraging people to shop locally when they can, keeping wealth circulating within their community.During the pandemic, Irsquove chaired the East Lothian Council Town Centre Recovery Groupelected, Irsquoll initiate an East Lothian Business Advisory Group to ensure the vital business voice is heard.Our high streets are being supported by  per cent non-domestic rates relief for retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation sectors this year, with Scottish Government investment of poundm.It has also invested poundm over the le of the parliament to support community-led regeneration and town centre revitalisation.I fully support this holistic approach to empowering communities.This, coupled with prioritising lsquowellbeingrsquo via a universal basic income running in parallel with doubling the child payment, gives families increased means of participating in a thriving society.The SNP Government has committed to , new homes, including affordable and social housing, stimulating the construction industry and ensuring warm, safe housing as essential.Sharing the responsibility for improving the lives of the most vulnerable benefits society.For a wellbeing local recovery and for recognising that no one is better off until everyone is better off, make both

included Anas Sarwar unveiling Scottish Labourrsquos recovery plan for Scotlandrsquos NHS following the devastating impact of the pandemic.He highlighted the backlog for cancer treatment, with thousands of missing cancer diagnoses as a result of Covid.We need an urgent plan to address this crisis, including rapid diagnostic centres and a catch-up plan for screenings by increasing staff and processing capacity to clear the backlog within a year.Child poverty in Scotland was one of the key issues covered in the first televised campaign debate.The SNP have been in power for  years but child poverty was rising again even before the pandemic hit.Scottish Labour believes the next parliament must prioritise a national recovery so that we can transform the lives of children across Scotland and end the scandal of child poverty.Another big pledge this week from Anas Sarwar is for a lsquoClean Up Holyroodrsquo Commission.The recent behaviour of our MP has demonstrated how little power constituents have over elected representatives in between elections.The commission will consult on ideas to give Scotland a parliament that can better hold the government to account and win back the trust of the people.As lockdown continues to ease, Irsquom pleased to see more local businesses and organisations able to open up again.This has been such a dficult last  months and I know that many businesses have been using lockdown to refine and renew the way they welcome customers back.I wish them all well in the weeks ahead and encourage people to keep shopping locally.Finally, the easing of restrictions has also meant Irsquove been able to get out and do more leafleting, restoring some semblance of normality to an otherwise very dferent election campaign.Leaflets and direct

He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond. Here are the game plans for the socially distanced electionA closing anecdote. I recall chatting to a senior political strategist who had been struggling to explain to obdurate colleagues the tactical subtleties of electoral campaigning under the Single Transferable Vote in multi-member council wards.Finally, in exasperation, he yelled at them: ldquoLook, this isnae politics.

Yrsquoknow. What le would be like in the long, medium and short termthe nation of Scotland voted to become a new state. What advantages there might be.

Which broken British social and financial systems might be recast, which disastrous Thatcherite privatisations undone, what democratisation begun once Westminsterrsquos ldquowinner takes all template in welfare, defence, foreign relations, economy, energy infrastructure and trade is completely removed from our politics. And yes, which currency Scotland would use, how much debt incurred, and what kind of risk and disruption encountered along the way.On these big issues that lie at the heart of a proposition backed by three political parties, scarcely a word will be said during this misleadingly named ldquoindependence election campaign.That will please some people ndash but the half-hearted gumming of independence side issues and referendum logistics could leave us all with the worst of both worlds. Not sufficiently indy-free for opponents of constitutional change, but not full-blooded, vivid, detailed or real enough for everyone .So, letrsquos be honest.

All these questions ndash while erting ndash are just political window-dressing.If the SNP, Greens and Alba believe we need an independence referendum within the letime of this new Parliament to build back better, then Scots deserve some straightforward, honest discussion of that core question.Will Scotland tackle climate change and Covid recovery better as an independent country or as part of the United Kingdom  Itrsquos the debate voters are having among ourselves ndash with no broadcasters or politicians bold enough to lead the way.Irsquod give my eye teeth to hear or see it on the box. But that will not happen. Not on BBC Scotland anyway. Its first leadersrsquo debate was an unfocused, superficial, sloganencouraging and unrevealing encounter.Meanwhile, the world weariness of some BBC Scotland journalists is increasingly hard to conceal.Last week, one reporter volunteered that she hated election campaigns and was just looking forward to the final results, while another made daring mention of ldquothe I word in an election report asindependence was some unspeakable, embarrassing mad aunt locked in the political attic. So much, so normal.But might Alex Salmond enter the ring and stir things up  The Alba leader is contesting his exclusion from BBC debates but the corporation has successfully resisted many legal challenges to debate line-ups and I doubt it will cave in now.Besides, Mr Salmondrsquos inclusion might not deliver a greater independence focus, given the inevitable distraction and muddying of waters created by two bitter rivals standing on one TV .Furthermore, comments by Anas Sarwar suggest Nicola Sturgeon might not be aloneshe simply refused to appear with the former SNP leader.But letrsquos not be naive. Itrsquos not just the broadcasters ndash it suits every political party to avoid the actual subject of independence as well.Scottish Labour has started its Holyrood campaign on the front foot. It wonrsquot want to risk that impetus by ing deep into issues like low pay, precarious work and brutal benefit regimes which can only be tackled by wrestling power from Westminster. Douglas Ross faces an even bigger challenge.Managing to look awkward atop a large Army vehicle last week, every appearance reminds voters that while the MP for Moray is physically larger than Ruth Davidson, the new Scottish Conservative leader is nowhere near as comfortable in his own skin or politically bullet-proof.So, Douglas Ross will be happy to keep making swipes at ldquoseparation without being drawn into real debate about the benefits of the union.Willie Rennie would have to lay aside the publicity stunts with giant deckchairs and badgers to become the unionrsquos most passionate advocate and while the Greens must persuade Yessers they really back independence after acquiring more profile for their stance on gender rights, they also have to put clear green water between themselves and other indy parties on the list.So, with relatively few bites of the media cherry, the party will probably major on the green recovery. Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon has a record to defend and a wariness of half-launching any independence campaign without final, settled positions on currency, deficits and borders.Still, she may have to tryAlex Salmond lets rip at his policy launch tomorrow. Of course, the Alba tail cannot wag the SNP dog.But since Ms Sturgeon has had five post-Brexit years to devise new independence strategies, it may seem strange to votersshe doesnrsquot leap at the chance to unveil them.

Equality is also a critical issue ndash % of adults living in Scotlandrsquos deprived communities have reported a limiting long-standing illness, compared to % in more affluent parts of the country.The Covid- pandemic has brought increased urgency to the issue of inactivity, with statistics showing that % of people with a long term health condition have been doing less activity than normal during lockdown.If Scotland is to recover from the pandemic and address health inequalities, we need to act now. The benefits of regular physical activity are well-proven. As much as % of long-term conditions can be caused by inactivity. People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing signicant health conditions. Research also shows that physical activity can boost self-esteem and energy, while reducing risk of stress and depression.The pandemic has heightened the importance of ensuring everyone has access to local services and facilities to participate in and enjoy physical activity. Everyone should have a right to access facilities and services to maintain their health, especially iniduals living with long-term conditions who, as a group, have struggled to maintain activity during Covid- due to support being lost and facilities being closed. Yet, as we feel the economic bite of the pandemic, many of our leline facilities are potentially under threat of closure due to lack of funding. Ensuring everyone can access their local parks and countryside is critical both from a healthcare and equity basis.Post-Covid recovery offers an opportunity for change. We believe that through national and local leadership, there is a real opportunity to create a step-change in our approach to physical activity and revitalise our communities and workplaces through appropriate infrastructure to encourage active travel and physical activity.In doing so, we will create jobs, local opportunities and resilient communities. We need a mix of personalised social prescribing, such as prescribed physical activity, and appropriate pathways for all NHS patients.

He now lectures at South Lanarkshire College.The Conservatives came third in Glasgow Anniesland in , while Mr Aibinus placing on the partys Glasgow list means he could face an uphill battle to secure a seat in Holyrood.But the -year-old said: \"I want to get into the Scottish Parliament, but the key thing for me about leadership is its not just about getting into parliament.\"He added: \"My ability to inspire the next generation for me is much more important than even getting into the Scottish Parliament.\"Because I could get into the Scottish Parliament, and not encourage anyone to get involved in politics. I think thats a failure of leadership.\"Evenby standing, Im encouraging people to stand for the Conservative Party, to be bold, I think thats a huge achievement in itself.\"The Scottish Parliament has faced criticism over its lack of ersity.Since , there have only been four MSPs from black, Asian and minority ethniccommunities. All have been men of Scots-Pakistani heritage.SNP Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf previously said this record of \"no black MSP ever, no female BAME MSP ever\" was \"frankly a failure of all of us, regardless of party\".The SNP has put BAME or disabled candidates top in its eight regional lists.The partys hopefuls include Graham Campbell, Glasgows first African Caribbean councillor, who is standing in Lothian.Mr Aibinu said Scotland had a \"dferent pattern of migration compared to what we have down south in, for example, places like London\".But he said it is becoming more erse, adding: \"With that change there should come more representation in the Scottish Parliament.\"So I think what we have right now, Im actually quite encouraged that we have more candidates coming forward from specically a black background wanting to stand for the Scottish Parliament, and the Conservative Party is right at the forefront of this.\"He continued: \"We now have a much larger pool of people in Scotland and in Glasgow specically, which is perhaps the most erse of the cities in Scotland.\"So Im hoping maybe at the next Westminster general election, wed have people from black backgrounds standing as well.\"However, he said representation is \"not just about having elected members in parliament\".He added: \"Its also about parliament being open to communities.\"Mr Aibinu said there is \"work to be done\" but he is \"encouraged by the current trajectory\".He said: \"From a policy perspective, mentorship is something we should encourage.\"The Tory hopeful said he had experienced racism in the past.He added: \"I dont let it stop me.

Proposals to scrap the tests come after ministers said earlier this year that they would remain available for teachers to deliver following disruption caused by Covid-related school closures.Ross Greer, education spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said the decision to ldquoimpose standardised assessments on pupils as young as four was ldquoa mistake.He added: ldquoSNSAs create a pressure on teachers to narrow the curriculum and focus on satisfying test scores, rather than equipping young people with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed.ldquoThe Greens will scrap these tests at the first opportunity.Mr Greer said the SSLN provided important national data on attainment levels by sampling schools in a non-intrusive manner.Ross Greer said his party would axe the tests at the first opportunity.ldquoScotlandrsquos teachers meet some of the highest professional standards in the world, he added.ldquoWe should put our trust in them to deliver what their pupils need, rather than obsessively gather data which has little practical use.ldquoThe SSLN survey did exactly that, before the Government scrapped it.

Off he careens, into the distance, until hes just a speck, that invisible elastic between parent and child stretching but never breaking.Seeing that level of confidence and enjoyment is wonderful to watch. You only hope it continues, becomes a le long pleasure.In the first few months of the pandemic, among all the hardships and relentless grim news, it really was wonderful to see such an increase in people out on bikes.We were inching into the summer months and, with just one hour allowed outdoors, many people chose to use that time cycling.The parks were full of people exploring but vastly reduced traffic and quiet roads made cycling around the city a relaxed experience, rather than one spent hyper vigilant, watching for trouble, and so many more new cyclists were taking advantage of the situation.Those numbers have kept increasing and the latest figures, this week, show that cycling is up by % in Scotland.While thats good news, it also makes a lot of sense. The roads are still quieter than pre-pandemic, there is still a hesitancy to use public transport, and were so limited in our leisure options that people are turning to outdoor pursuits for exercise and socialising.There has also been a huge push from local authorities during the lockdown to create more space for people walking and cycling and to make the roads more amenable to non-vehicular traffic.The issue, as we move forward through and out of the pandemic, is going to be about how we keep encouraging people on to their bikes and give them the confidence to feel as free in the saddle as a four-year-old.Even with the improvements of the past  months, barriers still exist, particularly for women cyclists.In Scotland, more than three times as many men than women commute to work by bike.When asked, women speak about concerns over safety. They are worried about the harassment they face while out on their bikes. Id love to tell you that cat calls and aggression are an unfounded fear, but I would be lying.Often women are the ones doing the school run, which is not impossible by bike but understandably has logistical concerns that can be off putting.Research from Sustrans showed that, as well as fitness levels and safety, womens concerns were linked to their appearance. If that seems like vanity, its not. Women are judged on how they look and it can be a faff to commute by bike then look smart for the office.It involves forward planning, carrying clothes back and forth, arriving at work early to change and sort hair and make up in toilets, and etc. A tip: waterproof trousers will change your le.There is nothing worse than spending the morning on an office chair with a soggy bottom.I completely understand the hesitancy to start cycling and the fear of being on the road. It makes me laugh to look back at how gradually I took my bike out. I started off literally cycling to the end of my street and back. Then I was brave enough to make it to the park for a cycle round and home again.Eventually a colleague, who lives nearby, offered to accompany me on the commute to the office. He was big and bold and I hide behind him the whole way there and all the way back again.There are lots of ways of getting support with confidence building though. In Glasgow, Bike For Good is a brilliant social enterprise doing great work helping people new to cycling and supporting cyclists to maintain their bikes.Bike For Good acknowledges that cycling can have particular challenges for women and non-binary people and that bike maintenance can be a male-dominated area so they have specic sessions catered for people who dont identy as men. Theres also a new buddy scheme being set up.In cities theres also issues with cycle storage for those in flats and tenements but this is slowly being addressed with the introduction of on-street secure cycling parking.Despite the improvements over the past year, its good to get out with a more confident buddy as some of Glasgows cycle routes are bonkers and can be off-putting to a novice. You can find yourself having to bump down kerbs to keep on the route being erted away from well lit and visible paths on to glass-strewn, cobbled back lanes or one moment be dutully following painted routes and the next moment come up against metal railings with nowhere to go.But when you find yourself sailing along a well-constructed, properly thought out, segregated cycle route... theres nothing like it. Gliding along, away from the traffic, fresh air in your face.Yes, sometimes dirt spraying from the road onto your cheeks yes, sometimes rain suddenly bursting unexpectedly from a clear sky yes, sometimes wind in your face that makes your thighs ache from the effort of pedalling.Cycling is not always joyous but there is always a little bit of joy about it.One of the major barriers, though, and the most dficult to tackle, is the ingrained lack of respect for cyclists and cycling. Not only from drivers but from those who are creating our cycle lanes.This morning, on a short, two-mile journey from Glasgow Sherf Court to the South Side, I had to navigate around five cars parked in cycle lanes and then three workmens vans stopped on the South City Way segregated cycle route. Drivers are more often than not parked on the South City Way.Theyll argue that they cant block the road but thats part of the problem with how we perceive cycling infrastructure - as though it is an added extra, a luxury, rather than fundamental. The car is still king and its routes to be as protected as a royal parade.As the cycle routes around the south side of the city are developed there have been a lot of roadworks. Every effort is made to keep carriageways open for cars but the bike lanes are closed and replaced with the dreaded Cyclists Dismount signs.I look forward to the day that changes are needed to facilitate roadworks and drivers are told to Park Here and walk the rest of the way. Thats obviously an imperfect comparison but it almost literally grinds my gears that these road changes dont take into account the fact cyclists are also commuters with somewhere to be.The ersions that are put in place for cyclists can sometimes be mind-bendingly confusing. Theres one at Buchanan Wharf, as you come off the Squiggly Bridge, that has painted arrows for cyclists that,you follow them, take you right into the path of oncoming foot traffic with nowhere  to go.I do, though, see improvements being made. The way to encourage more people to cycle is fairly simple - make cities and town centres less attractive to cars so other activities and means of transport naturally fill those spaces.Its an exciting time for cyclists and its a good time to be supporting people to take up cycling. There are hurdles but hard work going on to overcome them.Just imagine - city spaces where you can be free to fly as confidently as a four-year-old whos learned the pleasure of two wheels."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmThere have been no new positive cases of COVID- for Orkney today, Thursday, according to the daily figures posted by the Scottish Government.

The first priority has to be keeping people safe.Mr McMahon demanded more details about the criteria by which the traffic light system would be decided, and said the Government ldquomust come up with a comprehensive financial support package for the aviation sector and its supply chain.The Business Travel Associationlambasted the report as ldquoyet another hammer blow for business travel, and called on the Government to ldquoat the very least maintain the furlough scheme for the travel industry until September.ldquoWhilst we welcome the acknowledgement of the importance of business and leisure travel to the UK economy, this theoretical framework provides no more certainty than the Prime Ministerrsquos brief comments on Monday, BTA CEO Clive Wratten said in a statement.ldquoThe traffic light system is something we have long campaigned for. However, it is only one piece of the jigsawthe aviation, business, and leisure travel industries are to survive.ldquoWe urgently ask the Government to at the very least maintain the current furlough scheme until September for the entire travel supply chain. This will hopefully enable us to contribute to UK plc as soon as it is safe to do so. vw,vw,px, px\"Labourrsquos Jim McMahon says the findings show the Government is short on strategy over the recovery of the travel industry from the pandemic Rory Boland, editor of industry publication Which  Travel, said the report was ldquoan important step towards resuming international travel but ldquofalls short in providing solutions, adding the current cost of Covid tests risked pricing people out of taking holidays.ldquoThere is also little detail on reassurances that destinations wonrsquot suddenly be moved from green to amber or red, putting travellers at risk of last-minute changes and unaffordable quarantine costs, he said in a statement.The Board of Airline Representatives in the UKwelcomed the report, saying it would help airlines prepare for theof international flying.ldquoClearly we would like the Government to sharpen their pencils on the plan in advance of implementation but the framework creates the building blocks to open up further through the built-in review periods, the boardrsquos CEO Dale Keller said in a statement.Mr Keller said BAR UK would also propose initiatives such as the acceptance of rapid lateral flow tests.copy -.

He said the change was being made out of an abundance of caution.The pivot represents a signicant sht in Australiarsquos overall approach and is likely to delay plans to have every person in the country inoculated by October.A major part of Australiarsquos strategy had been the ability to make its own vaccines at home and not rely on shipments from abroad.Our CEO, @AlbertBourla sharing #Covid vaccine manufacturing updates from our Kalamazoo, Michigan site after @POTUS stopped by. #ScienceWillWin cc:@WHCOVIDResponse Watch here # pic BNRFhAsTUSmdash Pfizer Inc.February , It had planned to manufacture some  million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for  million people.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs.

The scale of the  disaster still resonates to this day and, not surprisingly, we in Northern Ireland remain particularly intrigued by the tragic story. After all, the near legendary ‘unsinkable ship’ was built on the slipways and docks of Harland and Wolff.We have flocked to see several epic movies about the disaster and watched fascinated as deep sea submersibles have traversed the wreck of the ship.Who can forget the elaborate chandelier apearing out of the murk when the first cameras were sent into the wreck at the bottom of the Atlantic.But only a small number of local people will be aware that Alexander Carlisle who led the initial design team for the project was from Ballymena.With the help of a few sources we hope to make the link between the City of the Seven Towers and the most famous ship in history.Perhaps the best article on Carlisle’s role has been penned by Paul Louden-Brown FRSA for the Titanic Belfast website. And he begins his exploration by asking why so many people have credited the much more famous Thomas Andrews, played by Victor Garber in the enormously successful  movie, with the design. Louden-Brown argues that Thomas Andrews did not design Titanic or her sister ships Olympic and Britannic.He states, unequivicolly that the man who deserves credit for the design is Alexander Carlisle.He writes: “So why, when so much is written and talked about Titanic, has such a mistake been made  The answer lies partly in the power of film.“In  Walter Lord’s best seller ‘A Night to Remember’ about the Titanic disaster was turned into a feature film.“The film’s screenplay, outside of the author’s control, featured a degree of dramatic license in order to increase the impact of the story.“ The first of these dramatizations was the launch of Titanic - the White Star Line held no formal naming ceremony for their steamships and Titanic was no exception - yet in the film a lady names the vessel and breaks a bottle of champagne over the bows.“I asked Bill MacQuitty, the Belfast-born producer of the film, who, as a child, witnessed the launch of Titanic, why he included an invented scene in his film “His answer was revealing ‘because it’s what an audience expects to see at the launch of a ship.’ The same, he said, applied to Thomas Andrews’ characterization.“The idea of the designer of the ship going down with his creation, while the owner escaped in a leboat, was too good a storyline to ignore.”Louden Brown continues: “MacQuitty was well aware who really designed Titanic and that J. Bruce Ismay was not a coward but his primary concern was turning an historical event into a commercially successful feature film.“ In that respect he succeeded and ‘A Night to Remember’ remains the definitive version with Titanic enthusiasts and the public alike.“The film’s influence is clear to see. James Cameron’s blockbuster film ‘Titanic’ also re-enforced Andrews’ position as ‘designer’ in a similar caricaturization to that used by MacQuitty almost forty years before.”Countless books, magazine articles, TV documentaries and even a set of th anniversary stamps featuring an image of Andrews all reinforce the misconception that he designed the ship - the invented story is just too powerful.Louden Brown continues: “None of this uncomfortable truth is intended to take anything away from the reputation of Thomas Andrews he was a brave man and did his duty.“He died helping others and his name is properly honoured in the country of his birth but he does not deserve credit for designing the ‘Olympic’ class liners that honour belongs to Carlisle.“The man who designed Titanic was born in Ballymena, Co. Antrim on  July . Alexander Montgomery Carlisle, eldest of five children and the son of John Carlisle, Headmaster of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, was educated at his father’s school.In , aged sixteen, he began work at Harland  Wolff as a premium apprentice. Serving alongside him for the next five years was his friend, fellow apprentice and future brother-in-law William James Pirrie . The two young men were destined to play a leading role in the development of Harland  Wolff.In April  Carlisle married American born Edith Wooster, twelve years his junior, at the First Congregational Church in San Francisco.The couple had two daughters and a son and, as Carlisle was steadily promoted, the family purchased a large red brick house in Elmwood Avenue near Queen’s University.In  Carlisle was made chief naval architect at the yard and from this date he designed some of most famous liners belonging to the White Star Line amongst the long list were Teutonic, Cymric, Oceanic, Adriatic and finally the ‘Olympic’ class liners.As Manager his redevelopment plan of the yard in order to facilitate the construction of the world’s largest liners transformed Harland  Wolff into a virtual factory production line.At the end of June  he resigned from the positions of General Manager and Chairman of Managing Directors at the relatively young age of fty-five - the reason for his decision to resign are unknown. Remarkably he had never taken a day’s sick leave since joining the firm.Universally popular with the workforce, who nicknamed him ‘Big Alec’, the growing issue of Home Rule and the political instability of the period may have contributed towards his decision to leave. At the time of his retirement Carlisle split his time between his homes in Belfast and  Hyde Park Place, Londonsup.His designs for the ‘Olympic’ class were completed with both vessels under construction Olympic plated and just four months away from launching and Titanic in frame.Thomas Andrews’ involvement, from July onwards, was to take up where Carlisle had left off in the management of a project where the major designs decisions had been completed several years before.Continued from page : Louden-Brown ‘s article continues: The disaster which overtook Carlisle’s last creation was said to have broken his heart.Called to give evidence at the British enquiry into the loss and asked about his role in the design of Titanic, he explained that he was in charge of turning the concept for the ‘Olympic’ class into design reality.Both ships, he said, were ‘entirely designed practically by Lord Pirrie. The details, the decorations, the equipment and the general arrangements all came under me.’Carlisle was being modest about his influence and abilities. His ‘signature style’ for the White Star fleet was well established by the s the proportions of the hull to the upper works, rake of the funnels, spacing of the masts, design of the bridge front and more, gave each vessel an unmistakable and identiable White Star look.Lord Pirrie’s opinions on the design, or otherwise, were not sought by Lord Mersey and it remains a signicant oversight that he was not called to give evidence, or asked to provide even a written statement, particularly with regard to the decision made regarding the number of leboats provided on each ship.Carlisle placed blame for the lack of leboats with the White Star management.It was Carlisle who outlined the design of what became the Welin Quadrant Davit system, capable of handling up to twice the number of leboatsthe Board of Trade regulations required, but the owners made the decision to reduce this number to just  with four collapsibles.The famous shipbuilder always followed his own inclinations having scant respect for convention.In February  he was arrested on a Coroner’s warrant for failing to attend the inquest into the death of a workman killed in the yard. On promising to attend the adjourned inquest he was released.He was made an Irish Privy Councillor by King Edward in . Like Pirrie, Carlisle became a Home Ruler - campaigning for an indpendent Irish Parliament within the Imperial context.Carlisle, a keen collector of autographs, counted amongst his collection many prominent personalties including those of King George and Kaiser Wilhelm.He met the Kaiser on a number of occasions before the First World War. His eldest daughter married Baron Frederick von Versen, one of the Kaiser’s aides, and in  when visiting the married couple in Berlin he was entertained by the Kaiser.The two men were formally introduced at the unveiling of Queen Victoria’s memorial in front of Buckingham Palace in  and they met again when he was a guest at a famous supper party after one of the Kiel yachting regattas.A noted Germanophile, the Ulsterman was certainly impressed with all things Germanic and made several Atlantic crossings in the liners Amerika, Kaiserin Auguste Victoria and Imperatorit appears his tastes were better satisfied by the lavish surroundings in the German liners.Long after the war, anti-German sentiment still prevailed in Britain but it did not bother him.It was rumoured that a rt existed between Carlisle and his brother-in-law Lord Pirrie, but no reason has been offered as to why this should have been the case. The most plausible explanation was Carlisle’s Bohemian tastes, his close ties with the Kaiser, popularity with the workmen in the yard and his plans to join the Labour party and stand as a Parliamentary candidate.The many statements he made about German shipbuilding ‘they are equal in every way to us as shipbuilders and operators’ and his prophesy that they would once again compete with the British in the size and speed of ocean liners and his left wing politics did nothing to endear him to the Chairman of Harland  Wolff.For Pirrie, a Liberal but conservative by nature and by now a rising star of the British establishment, the idea of a relative with known German sympathies making statements like this and with a daughter married to a former aide of the Kaiser was galling enough, but,he had lived long enough to discover Carlisle also planned to visit his old friend the now ex-Kaiser, it would probably have ended their relationship.Eighteen months after Pirrie’s death in November  Carlisle did just that and visited Wilhelm exiled at Doorn in the Netherlands he said at the time ‘My friends tell me that it was an extra-ordinary thing for a British subject to accept the hospitality of the former War Lord, whose subjects, military and civilian, chanted the Hymn of Hate, but I am an unconventional man.’He stayed for a weekend and in some style the standards the Kaiser was used to in the old days at Potsdam were still kept up. He brought along his autograph book and the two men reminisced about many of the famous names the book contained and, le before the war. Carlisle had been unwell for sometime with heart and lung problems, and during his stay ‘took a chill’.Defining convention to the very end he organized and paid for his funeral in advance, proudly showing off to family and friends the framed cremation certicate that cost pound s d and telling them how cheap it was to dispose of himself in this way and that it was time he disappeared from this earthly stage.That time came on  March  at his London home and three days later, on the th, his funeral, as arranged, took place at Golders Green in North West London. The German theme continued with light music - Schubert’s ‘Reminiscences’ and ‘Nachtstuck’ and an Allegretto by Mendelssohn - played by an organist who was also paid in advance. There was no clergyman present, no formal religious rites were observed, no hymns were sung and no prayers were recited. The small group of mourners included his two daughters, sisters Viscountess Pirrie, Mrs Hunter and several family friends. After the cremation he left instructions for the ‘Merry Widow’ waltz to be played as his ashes were scattered in the Garden of Rest. ‘I am sure it will be more agreeable than the dead march from “Saul”’, he had remarked.So ended the le of a remarkable man. During his letime Carlisle had overseen the tremendous growth in world shipbuilding and his own part, pivotal in transforming the emigrant ship into a virtual floating city and the need for improved le saving appliances in the new generation of large passenger liners, but his plans were ignored. Many of the obituaries published in Britain omitted mention of Titanic, still a painful subject even in . In other countries that was not the case and he was given the credit he deserved for his far sighted designs and for the influence he made on British and world shipbuilding, denied him in modern times because of the power of film, the very thing, paradoxically, that has been largely responsible for keeping the story of Titanic alive.

In line with JCVI advice, people in Northern Ireland aged - who do not have an underlying medical condition will be offered an alternative vaccine, when this is available.It is very important that everyone who has already had their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine gets their second dose of the same vaccine, irrespective of age.

He said lockdown and a bit of decluttering had given him an opportunity to revisit an old favourite he played while working on Downtown Radio’s First Edition breakfast show with Richard Young.At one stage, we played this song by Ray Stevens called the Mississippi Squirrel Revival. When I came across it, I thought I hadn’t played it in years, so I asked Alexa to play it, he added.You would have to hear it — it’s one of those songs that would put a smile on your face.It’s not one of his best-known songs, like Misty or Everything is Beautul, but it just struck a chord with listeners.During lockdown,I’m having one of those days that makes you go ‘oh God, more of this’, I stick it on. It makes me smile.Rebecca McKinney, who co-presents Cool FM’s breakfast show with Pete Snodden, uses music to lt her mood.Getting in the car and turning up the radio has always felt therapeutic to me, she said.During the first lockdown, I was shielding at home after being ill. Niall Horan’s Heartbreak Weather album was the one. This lockdown, the song Alright by Red Carpet is also on repeat.Conor Hogan, otherwise known as the Belfast Food Blogger, loves listening to music while working in the kitchen.I’ve been doing lots of cooking while we’ve been at home. Alexa is my new best friend to get a playlist going while I’m doing that, he said.I love listening to Counting Crows, Michael Jackson and Elvis. My favourite track of Michael Jackson’s would be Stranger in Moscow.We also listen to Dance Monkey by Tones And I about three times a day because my daughter, Lily , loves dancing to it.For comedian Shane Todd, who presented the Rave Lockdown on BBC Radio Ulster, Maniac  has been the track of the pandemic.It was the undisputed anthem of the Rave Lockdown. Songs like that invoke memories of my youth and long summers, he said.Belfast-based businesswoman Cathy Martin found solace not in single songs but in whole lives shows.Gok Wan’s live DJ sets on Facebook and Instagram made for an awesome kitchen party atmosphere, evenit was just ourselves, she said.According to the BPI survey, just one in  people are listening to less music than before or none at all.The jump in listening was most pronounced among the -to- age group, with almost half saying they consumed more music now than previously.The results also suggested people relied on their favourite songs for a boost when separated from friends or loved ones.Half of those surveyed listened to music to improve their mood, while % said it helped them wind down or sleep and % said it made them feel motivated.For the % who reported weekly feelings of anxiety, more than halfsaid songs eased their pain.Some % use it to alleviate boredom, % to improve concentration and % as an accompaniment to exercise.The statistics were taken from the BPI’s All About the Music study, which examined trends in the industry.It said Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga were some of the year’s most popular artists.Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, Brit Awards and Mercury Prize, added: Music has many intrinsic benefits, not least in raising spirits and promoting wellbeing, but this new research underscores just how much of a leline it’s been for people since lockdown, inspiring and reassuring us and also helping many of us to work, study and exercise to greater effect.The transformational power of music to improve lives has rarely been more pronounced.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dda-bfc-a--fcbfff_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Ireland PremiumMaureen ColemanOpinionThank you for the music... it#s been a real lesaver in lockdownThe poet Robert Browning was spot on when he famously wrote: Who hears music, feels his solitude peopled at once.Most ReadBrandon Lewis meets political leaders over Belfast disorder after Assembly unites to call for end to violenceVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastLoyalists planning more unnotied parades in act of #civil disobedience# as summer of disruption loomsSectarian Rangers supporter who vandalised GAA fans# cars charged with urinating on gravesSouth Belfast UPRG becomes first loyalist group to call for an end to unrestTop VideosPlayYouths shoot fireworks atpolice in west Belfast PlayBoris Johnson condemns violence in Northern Ireland after another night of unrestPlayBus set on fire and press photographer attacked as disorder resumes in BelfastLatest CoronavirusFionola MeredithOpinionAlways another reason to keep the NI Covid rules in placeRobin Swann launches consultation to extend modications to children’s social care regulationsFancy a pint  Stunning Northern Ireland homes and their back garden barsNI economy ‘will bounce back in second half of ’Latest from Belfast Taylor Swt turning bad blood with mogul Scooter Braun into a revolution for female artistsSnuts frontman Jack Cochrane: #It#s good to be pushed out of your comfort zone#Album reviews: From The Fratellis to Cheap TrickUS President Joe Biden#s White House voices concern over Belfast disorderSound Of Metal star Riz Ahmed: ‘Listening is done with your whole body’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Utterly reckless and depressing to see more violence at interface areas tonight. My heart goes out to those living in the area who are living with this fear and disturbance. This needs to stop now before lives are lost.The White House led condemnation following the scenes of Wednesday night#s violence in west Belfast which police have said was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for many years.Around  people were involved in a riot in the Shankill area on Wednesday evening with petrol bombs, bottles, masonry and fireworks thrown at police and also across the interface at Lanark Way.A bus was hijacked and petrol bombed, destroying the vehicle.

Mr Weir said: At this time it is even more important that youth services are able to meet the needs of young people in these areas.Condemning the Shankill disorder, Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said officers witnessed intense disorder in a built up area for a sustained periodBelfastphotographer Kevin Scott was also assaulted by two masked men and his camera equipment damaged. Following a special sitting of the Stormont Assembly the Executive later released a joint statement in a rare show of unity saying: Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society.Belfast Most ReadBrandon Lewis meets political leaders over Belfast disorder after Assembly unites to call for end to violenceVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastLoyalists planning more unnotied parades in act of #civil disobedience# as summer of disruption loomsSectarian Rangers supporter who vandalised GAA fans# cars charged with urinating on gravesSouth Belfast UPRG becomes first loyalist group to call for an end to unrestTop VideosPlayYouths shoot fireworks atpolice in west Belfast PlayBoris Johnson condemns violence in Northern Ireland after another night of unrestPlayBus set on fire and press photographer attacked as disorder resumes in BelfastLatest Belfast BeatUS President Joe Biden#s White House voices concern over Belfast disorderNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: latest delays and ersionsVideo: Youths clash with police in second night of trouble in west BelfastModerator joins calls for an end to ongoing civil unrestLatest from Belfast Snuts frontman Jack Cochrane: #It#s good to be pushed out of your comfort zone#Album reviews: From The Fratellis to Cheap TrickUS President Joe Biden#s White House voices concern over Belfast disorderSound Of Metal star Riz Ahmed: ‘Listening is done with your whole body’Minari star Steven Yeun: ‘This film has been a ride and a journey, and it dictates its own terms’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Derry has experienced seven days of disturbances in the Waterside area of the city during which police officers have been attacked, vehicles burned, roads blocked and residents left in fear. The work of Michael Mulqueen, Professor of Policing and National Security at University of Central Lancashire, has largely focused on Ireland and he is therefore well acquainted with NI politics. He believes that fundamentally the current disorder is rooted in the absence of effective political and community leadership. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News, Professor Mulqueen explains that in such a vacuum vulnerable people can be preyed upon. “Instead of being valued and supported, they are being drawn within the grip of serious criminal elements instead of being led on a path to cross-community healing, they are being infused with grubby politicised doctrines of suspicion and hate, and instead of being offered a future, they are being manipulated to ruin their le prospects by engaging in criminal behaviour,” he says. In his view, the two parties occupying the two polarities of Northern Irish politics - Sinn Feacutein and the DUP - carry a ‘heavy share’ of responsibility for what has occurred. googletag.cmd.push  Professor Mulqueensees promise in the neighbourhood policing model, driven by Chief Constable Simon Byrne and his senior team, which seeks to deliver impartial policing to all communities. That policing model, he says, is set up to be the very opposite of one side or the other asserting political control over Northern Ireland’s policing. “But because they profit from propagating deeply-rooted tribalism the parties concerned routinely seek to delegitimise the PSNI, resorting to allegations that it is biased and incompetent, even when evidence-led processes internal and external to it conclude otherwise,” the Lancashire Professor surmises. “The Sinn Feacutein leadership have stoked recent tensions by gathering in such numbers at the funeral of Bobby Storey.     “But traditional unionism, in its reaction to the subsequent PPS decision on prosecutions, has gone down the same route. “The First Minister, Arlene Foster, by calling on Chief Constable Simon Byrne and his senior team to resign, is targeting the standing of the PSNI chain of command at a time of sustained rioting.” He adds: “Proportionate, lawful and accountable public order policing depends upon clear lines of command and control, which the police hierarchy is designed to deliver. “By not fully thinking through the consequences of her antipathy for Mr Byrne, the First Minster is raising risk to officers and creating the wrong controversy – one that overshadows the hurt Sinn Feacutein inflicted upon many people by gathering in numbers at the funeral. “She is engaging in really hazardous politicking.” ‘WHATABOUTERY’ Similarly, he believes, the Pitt Park and Ormeau Road incidents were transformed from moments of potentially useful questioning of police actions into opportunities to delegitimise the police and, arguably, the state. Professor Mulqueen states: “Sinn Feacutein office holders could have reassured shaken communities that robust impartial mechanisms governed police performance and discipline. “They could have informed public debate by engaging themselves with Authorised Professional Practice , which comprises the evidence-based procedures produced by the UK’s College of Policing for everything from an arrest to a riot. Instead, they inflamed insecurity and doubt. “Officer decision making at Pitt Park is recognisable as a moment of adherence to APP’s requirement to balance competing risks. “Ormeau Road is both an instance of accountability in action and the severe scrutiny officers face in every aspect of their operational duties. It is a shame when this serious business is trivialised into political ‘whataboutery’.” Societal isions which have persisted for generations in Northern Ireland can be overcome, and a more prosperous NI realised, through the healing of ided communities. But, he says: “Sinn Feacutein, with a perennially strategic leadership focussed on coherent tactics to deliver their primary goal of a united Ireland, will have no issue with undermining the police as and when doing so serves that goal. “Traditional unionism is caught in a tangle of unfavourable consequences for Northern Ireland, arising from it being on the wrong side of history when a majority of UK voters decided to exit the EU in . “It is under pressure from a growing cacophony for a border poll that even the Irish Government is seeking to quieten. “The rationale for calling upon the Chief Constable and his senior team to resign is remarkably incoherent and, so, may be related to the pressures unionism is under. “All told, traditional unionism and the DUP in particular is a more unpredictable actor but one, current evidence suggests, is more likely to undermine policing, however unwittingly. “Certainly, the spectacle of the DUP’s First Minister refusing to meet the Chief Constable is a bad look for moderate unionists and the community generally.” .  HEALING Solving these intractable problems can be done through proper community policing, according to Professor Mulqueen. He says: “The neighbourhood policing model, which Chief Constable Byrne and his team are implementing, may not have been designed for this purpose but it is, however uncomfortably, exposing the deficits of Northern Ireland’s tribal politics. “Neighbourhood policing is about empowering all communities within a ing country. So, by its nature, it creates tensions with the sectional goals of those who do not wish the country toas the Good Friday Agreement sets out or who wish it to merge into something . He continues: “Politicians must reconcile with their voters the harm that their political priorities are doing against the healthy potential of a policing model that serves all people, regardless of allegiance. “This is why I am optimistic: in Northern Ireland right now, there is an excellent policing model and there is a police leadership team clearly wedded to implementing it, despite continuous challenge. “PSNI has serious challenges to face, not least of which is its legitimacy among all communities. “The root problem, however, is not with policing. The problem is one of weak politics and the time it takes for that to mature or give way to the business of healing and building communities served by a dedicated police service.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are smiles on the faces of the few people who are moving up and down the pavements. Approaching midday, the sun,not quite splitting the stones, is definitely causing them some discomfort. Traffic is almost constant. It comes through at a steady pace, the roar of passing lorries reverberating off Dungivens roadside shops and houses. A green and white ice cream van emblazoned with Super Mario rolls through the town. I can almost hear the theme tune in my head. googletag.cmd.push Dungiven Main Street curving down the hill. As I make my way up the hill, there is construction work going on in a few of the estates off Main Street. One man carefully removes paving stones in front of a set of flats. Further on, McReynolds Bar sits in forlorn darkness, mourning the loss of another sunny day in the beer garden. The towns other Covid-abandoned pubs would no doubt concur. The ornate gates of Gaelcholaacuteiste Dhoire are closed for Easter, but the sun illuminates the castle like a scene from a postcard. Across the street, the Kevin Lynch memorial has been spruced up, with Easter just around the corner. Political posters adorn street corners as parties jostle at the starting line ahead of next years Assembly election. googletag.cmd.push At the top of the town, traffic grinds to a halt, stled by road works that have created a narrow corridor of cones and warning signs. Heading back towards the town, I spot two people on a narrow laneway, seemingly in heated discussion. Both have puffy coats and woolly hats on, despite the strong sun, and there is a lot of finger-pointing. I decide to give them a wide berth. Passing through the town again, I notice the door to Inner Beauty is open. A glance in on the way past reveals a woman sitting cross-legged on the floor, with products strewn around her.     I have to go back. Road works at the top of the town are currently causing disruption. Claire McGill, who runs the skincare specialist salon, tells me she is preparing goodie bags to leave outside the salon for local children in place of their usual Easter celebrations. “Every Easter Saturday, we usually do an Easter egg hunt through the town, but Ive been closed since Christmas Eve,” she explains. “My customers are really running out of products now. Ive been doing deliveries, but to be honest, there is no profit in it, between time, effort and road works. “I did a delivery yesterday that was just to the top of the town and it took me over an hour. I only spoke to her for about two seconds at her front door too. Its a nightmare. “My phone hasnt stopped with people askingIm open today, because Ive had the shutter up doing this.” Claire says the latest period of lockdown has been a hard pull. Forced to seek the help of a local councillor in accessing government grant support, it still took a number of months. “I didnt get any grants because I dont have a rates bill in my name, so he got it all sorted. It took months, I only got my first one there in the middle of February, from October. ” she says. “I know everybody thinks getting pound a week when closed is fantastic, but firstly, its all taxable, so its only pound a week. “I have girls furloughed, so theres nothing left. My landlord is so decent, which is just as well, otherwise wed all be closed by now. “Were very lucky in the town that were in that everybody is very close,” she adds. Karen Groogan is looking forward to welcoming customers back in store. In an example of that close-knit community, Claire sends me across the street to meet Karen Groogan. Karen runs Groogans, a boutique clothes and fashion shop on the towns Main Street, and agrees with Claire that community support has been vital during this time. “In the run-up to Christmas, this year more than any other year, the town really got behind shopping local and it was brilliant,” she says. “Ive found this one has been harder for several dferent reasons. The weather has been a real downer and regarding shopping, I think people have been better prepared this year. “Last time I was able to help them out and ersy, selling things I wouldnt normally sell, whereas this time round, theyve had a houseful of stuff for their kids already.” Finvola keeps a watchful eye on Dungivens Main Street. As well as the dficulties associated with Covid, Karen is in two minds about the effect the new bypass will have on trade in the town. “I really dont know how its going to affect us. A lot of locals think its going to be a great thing for the town and encourage people to shop local,” she tells me. “I hope thats the way, but is there enough for them to shop local  We could really do with a good bakery, a good fruit and veg shop, but all those shops have closed because of the high rates. “Now were going to make the road to Derry even shorter. There is a feeling that when the town quietens down it will make people shop local, and I really hope thats true. “I do really well from passing trade though professional women going between Derry and Belfast for their work. They dont have the time to go shopping at the weekend and nor do they want to. “Whenever they come here, they know theyre going to get what they want. The girls that have come over the past four years know Im here, but its going to be hard to get any more girls like that. “Thats what I really worry about losing the passing trade. I really enjoy the company of them as well, so Im on the fence about whether or not it will be a good thing for the town.” Karens online trade has been good, but it doesnt replace the rapport she builds with her customers. “We do have a website, but I prefer to be open and able to sell things to people,” he says. “My shop is the kind of shop that you come in for one thing and you come out with more. Its a treasure trove. “Its got all sorts of dferent things school wear, home wear, childrens and ladies clothes, whereas it can be a bit limiting online.” The Roe sparkling in the March sun. Moving past the empty shop fronts at the bottom half of the town, your reward is the sight of the sun shimmering on the clear waters of the Roe. A young couple appear along its banks, ing from a ramble in the nearby fields. Throughout lockdown, people have rediscovered the beauty of their immediate surroundings. While the fine weather intensies dreams of normalitys , many will be hoping ambivalence to local nature spots will notwith it. In Dungiven, the community has pulled together, and they will look to harness that spirit of regeneration after Covids bitter chapter is finally drawn to a close.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theyd have known each other from the discos in Slaughtneil.” Club rivalry was parked. Joe asks himself how they all managed to pull in the same direction. But they did. That was the magic of it all. *** The late Paddy and Peggy Trolan moved from Brackagh, in Desertmartin, to settle in Draperstown with the building of Moykeeran in the sixties. Joe was one of nine children. There were four houses in a row, the Trolans, their neighbours Murrays, followed by Gormleys and the Mullans. The walk up the hill to Straw seemed like a daily pilgrimage, with the gear-bag slung over the shoulder. Pat Joe McKenna, Seamus Doherty and Laurence Groogan wouldve been preaching the hurling gospel. “Those lads wouldve kept you going every night,” remembers Trolan, goalkeeper in Ballinascreens  winning U hurling squad. After five years of school at St Colms, three months at St Patricks Maghera, while he liked it, told him he didnt have the appetite for A-Levels. His parents supported his decision to leave school. His talents at Draperstown Celtic saw him picked up by Irish League club Coleraine, he signed up for a YTS through the soccer. “It was in Castlereagh College, in the middle of East Belfast,” Trolan recalls. Hed later follow it up with a BTEC business course in Magherafelt Tech, but the soccer pathway gave him his first break. Twelve from the YTS scheme and a dozen from the similar programme in the south toured America in , competing against university sides. “We battered them all,” Trolan remembers. Of  or  of the travelling Irish party offered scholarships, he was the only one to accept. “I was like why not, my O-Levels were good enough to get me in...I just thought lets go and do it.” In September , it was off to Floridas Flagler College, a first step in his journeyed career through the education system. A month and a half spell in the summer of  was his longest stint back home. He was soon back across the pond, to Atlanta, for both a Degree and Masters in Sociology at Georgia State University, followed by a second masters, this time it was in sport. An absence of a soccer team and ato his GAA roots with the recently formed Clann na nGael club in Atlanta gave him the a first taste of the home from home feel to the association overseas. Half of Bantry, mixed with Cavan and Armagh exiles, saw the club flourish and compete at the North American Championships. “I remember us winning a Junior B hurling championship one year in Boston,” Trolan adds. “That was the time the boys flew out from home for a few months. Youd Burnsy ,McNicholl, Mickey Boyle and Ollie Collins. “Some would fly for Labour Day weekend, with others coming out before that and theyd be doing a bit of work. “Youd see them walking about with their Jordanstown and Queens shorts on,” Joe laughs. After eight years in Atlanta, it was ato Florida for Joe where he began his PhD at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “Its been so long now, I dont knowI ever will finish,” Joe laughs. This time, with no GAA, it was back to soccer for his sporting fix. Orlando began a hurling team, Tampa Bay and Augusta had started up, “There just wasnt the demand where we were,” he explains. “Now itis massive, there are regions and even four or five college hurling teams.” With his American leg coming to a close, in , it was time to get his foot on the employment ladder. *** Joe thanks his lucky stars for Banpo Banter, an interactive section of the Seoul Gaels website, named after a part of the city along the Han River where the club trained. In his mid-thirties, and with his studies behind him, it was time to enter the real world and three job offers sat on the table. Vermont and Maine, where the two American opportunities lay, didnt have a GAA club, but typing GAA in Korea into an internet search unlocked Joes future. As the messages and banter began to flow online, he liked what he saw and could feel the warmth. Seoul Gaels was founded in  by a group of Irish teachers who came over for the World Cup and the lestyle appealed to them enough to look for work and stay. “The lads sounded like they were up for a bit of craic,” Joe says with a smile. “That made my mind up, I am going to go to Korea...I wanted to get back playing. I said Ill go to Seoul, have a bit of craic for a year and go back to the US.” Joe in action during the Asian Gaelic Games. Now,  years on, he is still there and loving le. After an initial one-year contract, he is now Assistant Professor in Hankuk University, where he lectures in sports management, development and community. On the GAA front, he was Chairman of the Asian Board and still plays a role on the committee, as Assistant Development Officer. “I landed here in March , joined up with the Gaelic and soccer teams over Paddys Day,” Joe begins. Thats when the penny dropped of the magnitude of the Asian GAA community. The names begin to roll off his tongue. Japan, Shanghai, Singapore...they all had teams. Later that year, the Asian Games Gaels took place in Bangkok with  teams involved – men and women. At the heart of it was Derry native John Campbell who founded Thailand GAA two years earlier. “After that tournament I said Im staying in Asia,” beams Joe, one of over  Irish exiles in Seoul. “I got to meet people from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Beijing, Hong Kong...everywhere. “That convinced me to stay, The university was fantastic, the people were great and as a bonus...the Gaelic was unreal.” The hurling was peripheral at the tournaments initially until an Irish influx – that included former Offaly player Gary Hannfy – saw the sport grow. Trolan describes Vietnam as a hotbed of all things GAA, with so many Irish are moving over. “We have  clubs in Asia,” he points out. “We dont realise how many people are out here until tournament time and then everybody comes out of the woodwork.” There are local tournaments, as well as the separate Southern and Northern Asian Gaelic Games. “For the main one, theAsian Gaelic Games, you are looking at over  people showing up and another couple of hundred who turn up to party and socialise...its a big deal,” said Trolan, a recent Hall of Fame winner, a trophy named after the late Brian Conlon from Newry-based First Derivatives, one of their sponsors. The games are seven minutes each way, with a two minute break in the middle. Friday night is the opening ceremony followed by wall to wall games on the Saturday. If you closed your eyes, it could be a GAA tournament anywhere in the world. By Sunday, the numbers are thinning out as the play-offs taper off towards the ious finals. “When you get knocked out, you start drinking and enjoying the craic,” Joe utters, with another infectious smile. On the Sunday night, the all you can eat and drink banquet has an annual fancy dress theme, with the Presidents of both the GAA and Ladies Football boards in attendance. An awards ceremony is factored into the festivities. “It is mayhem, but good mayhem,” Joe continues. “Last year we had Jack McCaffrey and Paul Mannion out, those two lads had a brilliant time and were blown away by the interest in GAA out here. “For us, it is all about the community, getting together and having a bit of fun, while making connections. It means where you go in Asia, you have someone to link in with and wed always meet up...thats what happens with the GAA.” At the tournaments, hed hear pockets of ex-pats conversing in Irish and was pleasantly surprised to hear the cúpla focal in areas of Seoul. While there is a bustling Irish community, a little under half the players would be non-Irish, a mixture of dferent nationalities. “On the womens side, there are a lot more locals playing because it is non-contact and players can pickoff the ground,” points out Trolan, who was Chairman of the Asian Board at the time the pick-up was taken out of the mens game. “We went to Croke Park and asked for a deviation and it was granted, so we kept it,” he explains. “It is one of the hardest skills for a lot of people and it was slowing the game down and frustrating a lot of the non-Irish, so we got rid of it.” Trolan speaks of locals playing the games in China and three or four of Seoul Gaels senior team being native Korean, a side that played in numerous finals. In another development, Trolan was central to starting a separate Youth Asian Gaelic Games, with around  players in action, at every age group from U to U. In Singapore, there is even a childrens officer going around schools and GAA is beginning to appear on the PE curriculum. “The lads in Hanoi have  Vietnamese kids out on a Saturday playing football,” Trolan states. Its tremendous progress. At the older age of the scale, the vibrant scene offers social football to everyone. Joe remembers joining in at Ballinascreen football training a few years back on a visit back home. “I was never so black and blue in my le. I forgot how fast it was and how hard people hit,” he laughs. “I am , there is a social hurling scene startingbutyou are over a certain age, there is not much there playing wise.” Seoul is dferent, with players continuing into their late fties with the junior teams, all for a bit of craic. Win or lose, there is a can of cold beer and banter on the sideline. Nobody is judged on their skill level or their physique. “The le is good here, the standard of living...even during the pandemic, le has been normal,” Joe admits. There were some restrictions, but no lockdown. Going to a restaurant or grabbing a coffee was the norm. He fits in a seven-mile run every day, with a longer one on Saturday and charges the batteries on a Sunday, as he gets himself primed for marathons. While he regrets not continuing to learn Irish in his younger years, he is trying his hand at Korean. The alphabet and reading it is easy, but speaking is a dferent story. “It is so hierarchical, with so many levels,” Joe concedes. “If we are out for a meal and I try to speak it, people will look at my wewanting to know what I am saying...so I pass the puck to her.” Joe and his we Helen during a trip to Shanghai. They live in the suburbs of Seoul, in Gwangju, close to work and a -minute bus journey from the city centre where the main university campus is. “We are surrounded by farmlands and I can smell slurry, its just like home,” he jokes. The transport network, he states, is the best in the world. Bus and train lines, all interlinked...you can get anywhere in the city for less than a fiver,” he continues. Will heto Ireland  If a similar job comes up at home, he might consider it. Growing up he never thought hed have ended up in America, let alone spend  years in Korea. “Now I am here, I dont know what will happen next, dont close the doors on opportunities,” he adds. Instead of Vermont or Maine, in small-town America, Joe ended up in a city of  million people. “I wouldve loved wherever I had ended up and had a good time,” Joe sums up. “But I am really glad I ended up in Seoul...with the football, hurling, getting involved in the Asian County Board and I met my we.

After studying in the USA, he spent  years in Seoul where sport still plays a huge role in his le and work. He spoke to Michael McMullan...The size of the ball may have ied, the continents have changed, but Joe Trolan and sport have never been far apart. His le has been defined by it. Growing up in Ballinascreen, his evenings pinged between football and hurling, stirred in with Draperstown Celtics soccer team. Dull moments were scarce. Now, he lectures in sport management in Seoul. The stamps accumulated on his passport have an interesting story to tell. As he navigated the globe, the former Derry minor hurling goalkeeper is a walking advert for the slogan fortune favours the brave, all with an infectious smile that radiates. The summer of  saw Peter Stevenson assemble a team to dance with the best that Irelands underage hurling landscape had to offer. All-Ireland champions Kilkenny exhaled palpable relief as Derry took them to the brink of a semi-final exit. googletag.cmd.push “I was a mad man in the changing room,” Trolan remembers of that Sunday morning in Croke Park. It took his next door neighbour in Moykeeran, Diarmuid Murray, to calm him down. On the pitch it was dferent. The bruises from being peppered by Geoffrey McGonagles shots in their practice matches that summer prepared him well. “He was an animal on the pitch,” Trolan recalls. “When we played games, as a keeper, I knew nothing could be worse than Geoffrey barrelling down at you.” Trolan was blown away by the natural skill of Mickey Collins and Rory Stevenson, a joy to watch. googletag.cmd.push At club level, he played behind Sean Farmer Kennedy and his thou shall not pass was the motto. If the ball got past him, the man wouldnt. “When you look at that Derry team, there were some serious headcases on it,” Trolan laughs. It was a team bus youd just love to have been on. He speaks of the mix of personalities. Rivalry, talent and laughter, all merged together. “When youd get Squidgyand Farmer together, they were lunatics. Theyd have known each other from the discos in Slaughtneil.” Club rivalry was parked. Joe asks himself how they all managed to pull in the same direction. But they did. That was the magic of it all.     *** The late Paddy and Peggy Trolan moved from Brackagh, in Desertmartin, to settle in Draperstown with the building of Moykeeran in the sixties. Joe was one of nine children. There were four houses in a row, the Trolans, their neighbours Murrays, followed by Gormleys and the Mullans. The walk up the hill to Straw seemed like a daily pilgrimage, with the gear-bag slung over the shoulder. Pat Joe McKenna, Seamus Doherty and Laurence Groogan wouldve been preaching the hurling gospel. “Those lads wouldve kept you going every night,” remembers Trolan, goalkeeper in Ballinascreens  winning U hurling squad. After five years of school at St Colms, three months at St Patricks Maghera, while he liked it, told him he didnt have the appetite for A-Levels. His parents supported his decision to leave school. His talents at Draperstown Celtic saw him picked up by Irish League club Coleraine, he signed up for a YTS through the soccer. “It was in Castlereagh College, in the middle of East Belfast,” Trolan recalls. Hed later follow it up with a BTEC business course in Magherafelt Tech, but the soccer pathway gave him his first break. Twelve from the YTS scheme and adozen from the similar programme in the south toured America in , competing against university sides. “We battered them all,” Trolan remembers. Of  or  of the travelling Irish party offered scholarships, he was the only one to accept. “I was like why not, my O-Levels were good enough to get me in...I just thought lets go and do it.” In September , it was off to Floridas Flagler College, a first step in his journeyed career through the education system. A month and a half spell in the summer of  was his longest stint back home. He was soon back across the pond, to Atlanta, for both a Degree and Masters in Sociology at Georgia State University, followed by a second masters, this time it was in sport. An absence of a soccer team and ato his GAA roots with the recently formed Clann na nGael club in Atlanta gave him the a first taste of the home from home feel to the association overseas. Half of Bantry, mixed with Cavan and Armagh exiles, saw the club flourish and compete at the North American Championships. “I remember us winning a Junior B hurling championship one year in Boston,” Trolan adds. “That was the time the boys flew out from home for a few months. Youd Burnsy ,McNicholl, Mickey Boyle and Ollie Collins. “Some would fly for Labour Day weekend, with others coming out before that and theyd be doing a bit of work. “Youd see them walking about with their Jordanstown and Queens shorts on,” Joe laughs. After eight years in Atlanta, it was ato Florida for Joe where he began his PhD at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “Its been so long now, I dont knowI ever will finish,” Joe laughs. This time, with no GAA, it was back to soccer for his sporting fix. Orlando began a hurling team, Tampa Bay and Augusta had started up, “There just wasnt the demand where we were,” he explains. “Now itis massive, there are regions and even four or five college hurling teams.” With his American leg coming to a close, in , it was time to get his foot on the employment ladder. *** Joe thanks his lucky stars for Banpo Banter, an interactive section of the Seoul Gaels website, named after a part of the city along the Han River where the club trained. In his mid-thirties, and with his studies behind him, it was time to enter the real world and three job offers sat on the table. Vermont and Maine, where the two American opportunities lay, didnt have a GAA club, but typing GAA in Korea into an internet search unlocked Joes future. As the messages and banter began to flow online, he liked what he saw and could feel the warmth. Seoul Gaels was founded in  by a group of Irish teachers who came over for the World Cup and the lestyle appealed to them enough to look for work and stay. “The lads sounded like they were up for a bit of craic,” Joe says with a smile. “That made my mind up, I am going to go to Korea...I wanted to get back playing. I said Ill go to Seoul, have a bit of craic for a year and go back to the US.” Joe in action during the Asian Gaelic Games. Now,  years on, he is still there and loving le. After an initial one-year contract, he is now Assistant Professor in Hankuk University, where he lectures in sports management, development and community. On the GAA front, he was Chairman of the Asian Board and still plays a role on the committee, as Assistant Development Officer. “I landed here in March , joined up with the Gaelic and soccer teams over Paddys Day,” Joe begins. Thats when the penny dropped of the magnitude of the Asian GAA community. The names begin to roll off his tongue. Japan, Shanghai, Singapore...they all had teams. Later that year, the Asian Games Gaels took place in Bangkok with  teams involved – men and women. At the heart of it was Derry native John Campbell who founded Thailand GAA two years earlier. “After that tournament I said Im staying in Asia,” beams Joe, one of over  Irish exiles in Seoul. “I got to meet people from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Beijing, Hong Kong...everywhere. “That convinced me to stay, The university was fantastic, the people were great and as a bonus...the Gaelic was unreal.” The hurling was peripheral at the tournaments initially until an Irish influx – that included former Offaly player Gary Hannfy – saw the sport grow. Trolan describes Vietnam as a hotbed of all things GAA, with so many Irish are moving over. “We have  clubs in Asia,” he points out. “We dont realise how many people are out here until tournament time and then everybody comes out of the woodwork.” There are local tournaments, as well as the separate Southern and Northern Asian Gaelic Games. “For the main one, theAsian Gaelic Games, you are looking at over  people showing up and another couple of hundred who turn up to party and socialise...its a big deal,” said Trolan, a recent Hall of Fame winner, a trophy named after the late Brian Conlon from Newry-based First Derivatives, one of their sponsors. The games are seven minutes each way, with a two minute break in the middle. Friday night is the opening ceremony followed by wall to wall games on the Saturday. If you closed your eyes, it could be a GAA tournament anywhere in the world. By Sunday, the numbers are thinning out as the play-offs taper off towards the ious finals. “When you get knocked out, you start drinking and enjoying the craic,” Joe utters, with another infectious smile. On the Sunday night, the all you can eat and drink banquet has an annual fancy dress theme, with the Presidents of both the GAA and Ladies Football boards in attendance. An awards ceremony is factored into the festivities. “It is mayhem, but good mayhem,” Joe continues. “Last year we had Jack McCaffrey and Paul Mannion out, those two lads had a brilliant time and were blown away by the interest in GAA out here. “For us, it is all about the community, getting together and having a bit of fun, while making connections. It means where you go in Asia, you have someone to link in with and wed always meet up...thats what happens with the GAA.” At the tournaments, hed hear pockets of ex-pats conversing in Irish and was pleasantly surprised to hear the cuacutepla focal in areas of Seoul. While there is a bustling Irish community, a little under half the players would be non-Irish, a mixture of dferent nationalities. “On the womens side, there are a lot more locals playing because it is non-contact and players can pickoff the ground,” points out Trolan, who was Chairman of the Asian Board at the time the pick-up was taken out of the mens game. “We went to Croke Park and asked for a deviation and it was granted, so we kept it,” he explains. “It is one of the hardest skills for a lot of people and it was slowing the game down and frustrating a lot of the non-Irish, so we got rid of it.” Trolan speaks of locals playing the games in China and three or four of Seoul Gaels senior team being native Korean, a side that played in numerous finals. In another development, Trolan was central to starting a separate Youth Asian Gaelic Games, with around  players in action, at every age group from U to U. In Singapore, there is even a childrens officer going around schools and GAA is beginning to appear on the PE curriculum. “The lads in Hanoi have  Vietnamese kids out on a Saturday playing football,” Trolan states. Its tremendous progress. At the older age of the scale, the vibrant scene offers social football to everyone. Joe remembers joining in at Ballinascreen football training a few years back on a visit back home. “I was never so black and blue in my le. I forgot how fast it was and how hard people hit,” he laughs. “I am , there is a social hurling scene startingbutyou are over a certain age, there is not much there playing wise.” Seoul is dferent, with players continuing into their late fties with the junior teams, all for a bit of craic. Win or lose, there is a can of cold beer and banter on the sideline. Nobody is judged on their skill level or their physique. “The le is good here, the standard of living...even during the pandemic, le has been normal,” Joe admits. There were some restrictions, but no lockdown. Going to a restaurant or grabbing a coffee was the norm. He fits in a seven-mile run every day, with a longer one on Saturday and charges the batteries on a Sunday, as he gets himself primed for marathons. While he regrets not continuing to learn Irish in his younger years, he is trying his hand at Korean. The alphabet and reading it is easy, but speaking is a dferent story. “It is so hierarchical, with so many levels,” Joe concedes. “If we are out for a meal and I try to speak it, people will look at my wewanting to know what I am saying...so I pass the puck to her.” Joe and his we Helen during a trip to Shanghai. They live in the suburbs of Seoul, in Gwangju, close to work and a -minute bus journey from the city centre where the main university campus is. “We are surrounded by farmlands and I can smell slurry, its just like home,” he jokes. The transport network, he states, is the best in the world. Bus and train lines, all interlinked...you can get anywhere in the city for less than a fiver,” he continues. Will heto Ireland  If a similar job comes up at home, he might consider it. Growing up he never thought hed have ended up in America, let alone spend  years in Korea. “Now I am here, I dont know what will happen next, dont close the doors on opportunities,” he adds. Instead of Vermont or Maine, in small-town America, Joe ended up in a city of  million people. “I wouldve loved wherever I had ended up and had a good time,” Joe sums up. “But I am really glad I ended up in Seoul...with the football, hurling, getting involved in the Asian County Board and I met my we. It took me on a nice trajectory.” Thank God for Banpo Banter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ollie Higgins, grandson of Essential Design Group directors Oliver and Mandy Higgins, passed away in July  after a year-long battle with a sarcoma cancer of the diaphragm. A number of the Castledawson companys employees have now launched an initiative to raise funds for Clic Sargent and the Childrens Cancer Unit Charity, who were hugely supportive during Ollies illness. The initiative coincides with the groups th year in business, and participants will be challenged to complete , steps every day during April. Donations will be collected online via Virgin Money and the public are encouraged to join in the action. googletag.cmd.push Rebecca Higgins, Ollies aunt, and Essential Designs Marketing Manager, said the -year-old was a little ball of energy. “He was such a happy-go-lucky wee boy, he wanted to be outside all the time playing,” she told the County Derry Post. “He did go through his chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and was fantastic through it. You wouldnt have known to look at him that he was going through treatment. “Unfortunately, though, he relapsed in April  and he was taken back into hospital. Then he was given a terminal diagnosis at the end of May, the day before his th birthday.” Both the chosen charities have been instrumental in helping the Higgins and Randlesome families through such a heartbreaking time. googletag.cmd.push Rebecca said Clic Sargents home from home initiative was a saving grace. “You get your own room, but its a shared house. Ours was called Pauls House. It is right across the road from the Royal Victoria Hospital,” she said. “It meant that when he was given his terminal diagnosis, the whole family could stay. We would have stayed with Ollie until late at night, and then we would have walked across the road. “We lived an hour away from the hospital, so it was fantastic to be able to stay up and spend every minute we could with him because we knew he was going to pass away soon.”     The family also wanted to support the Childrens Cancer Unit Charity, who also helped support them throughout the experience. A squad from the Coachman, Magherafelt, in their #littlehulk T-shirts. The charity provided Ollies sister Lucy with a memory box and helped provide opportunities for him to enjoy precious days out before he passed away. “Ollie wasnt allowed in crowds, we couldnt even take him to a coffee shop for his lunch, so they rented out places and got them all cleaned before the children came to that place. “It meant they could have days out where it was safe, and along with children who were going through the same thing as them. “They also did what was called the beads of courage. Each bead represents something Ollie went through, chemotherapy for example, and there are dferent-coloured beads for them.” While the company had ordered a number of T-Shirts, the huge interest and support from within their community for Ollies memory has meant they have already run out. Emblazoned on the T-shirts is the #littlehulk hashtag, a reference to Ollies nickname. Its meaning is twofold. “He absolutely loved the Hulk. He had a wee Hulk figurine and he carried him everywhere,” said Rebecca. “Thats how he got his nickname, but then he sailed through his treatment and was doing so well, so everybody said he was strong like the Hulk. “He loved Polepatrick too, we used to take him and he loved walking around through the forest, so thats why we chose Polepatrick as his resting place.” Donations can currently be made by searching for Ollie Higgins on Virgin Money, or by contacting Essential Design Group directly.

Last week, the Derry News revealed that the local school has launched a fundraising appeal to gather the pound, it owes the DE. Foyle College is a co-educational Voluntary Grammar School which has been providing a high-quality education for young people in the city and surrounding area for over  years. It is understood that the debt has to be repaid by the end of June or the school risks losing its Voluntary Grammar status and by extension its independence. googletag.cmd.push The DE was asked to confirm the date by which the debt has to be paid, what formula is used to decide how much the DE got from the sale of the old Foyle College lands and the potential ramicationsthe money cannot be gathered. In response, a DE spokesperson said: “As per normal procedures with schools, the Department is continuing to work with Foyle College to secure repayment of funds related to their move to the new site at Limavady Road.” Following the publication of last weeks article in the Derry News, a former pupil of Foyle College who is now living in Canada got in touch with the paper to encourage people ‘from around the world’ to help the local school. googletag.cmd.push In , Foyle College moved around  pupils from its home on Duncreggan Road and Northland Road to a new ‘state of the art’ campus on Limavady Road. The DE purchased the site and building. However, to allow pupils to attain the ‘first class’ academic, athletic and artistic standards it has set, the local College invested in additional facilities including sports pitches and extra classrooms. These enhanced facilities came at a cost of pound.m. Around poundm of that cost was covered by a previous fundraiser while the school awaited the final figures for the sale of its former campuses. It has since emerged that DE sold the original lands for pound.m.     According to Foyle College, the department retained pound.m of that for grants it previously awarded to the old school sites. That means pound.m was available to the school, leaving a deficit of pound,. In correspondence with alumni and friends of the school, the College says DE’s figures are based on ‘clawing back’ money that has been spent on a school prior to its new build. It reads: “Because the school has received grants from DE over the past  years to fund capital items at Springtown and Duncreggan, legislation provides that DE claw back a proportion of these grants against any sale proceeds from land owned by the school.” Foyle College is asking friends of the school to help raise pound, by June .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bombscares,Benficaand theBrandywell Stadium. This is the story of a community that needed to catch a breakand how its football club, exiled from the league for more than a decade, was brought back from the dead. TheBrandywellwas one of the poorest areas in Europe and home to Derry City Football Club. In the shadow of the civil rightsmovementand the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing. Until one day when the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. The ramications would eventually see Derry City FC banned from playing at home andput out of business. googletag.cmd.push A newco-commission fromBBC Northern Irelandand BBC Two,Dferent League: The Derry City Story,charts the extraordinary journey of onecommunity as they found a haven away from the violence and a taste of success like never before. Sometimes football can change the world. In , when times were bleak,the cityneeded a saviour. Tony O’Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international,Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin,to become the ‘Gang of Four’ who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown. googletag.cmd.push An incidental chat in a city centre shoe shop, managed by Terry, over some lunchtime sandwiches would change everything. With repeated rebuffs from the Irish League in Belfast to their requests to gain re-entry, the four lads decided to take their footballing revolutionsouth – to the League of Ireland in Dublin. They had no premises and no money. But they did have the phone number for a manager called Jim McLaughlin. Brought up in theBrandywell,Jim brought his team Shamrock Rovers to theBrandywellto play a makesht team of amateurs rounded up to play as Derry FC. The crowds flocked to the ground and the Gang were able to show that there was an appetite for football in Derry. It was time to cross the border and bring their big idea to the salubrious surroundings of the Burlington Hotel in Dublin.     The triumph-over-the-odds film, directed by local director Guy King and made for the BBC by State Of Grace Films and Stray Bear Films, follows the emotional storyof how in September , after  years in the wilderness, football was back at theBrandywell. The club would go on to lt silverware and lt the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism. Featuring in-depth interviews with the Gang of Four, never-before-seen archive footage and the memories of the faithful supporters, the film portrays an inspirational bunch of people who made their dreams come true. The rollercoaster took their club and community from the depths of despair to footballing nirvana, landinganhistoric domestic treble in the League of Ireland. It would culminate with the arrival of football royalty with Sven-Goran Eriksson bringing hisBenficateam of superstars into the heart of the Bogside for a European Cup tie. Dferent League: The Derry City Story will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday, April  at pm.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Raineys Director of Rugby is delighted. Theyve got their man. After a selection process, attracting many candidates, Ian McKinleys credentials elevated him to top of the pile. One thing the Rainey players will know, beyond anything  he brings to the table, their new Head Coach has experienced adversity and came through the other side. Real adversity, the sort that stops most. But not Ian McKinley. Loss of sight in his left eye forced him to tell Leinster coach Joe Schmidt he could no longer play. Leinster stood by him, offered him a shoulder to lean on long enough to secure a coaching role in Italy. googletag.cmd.push Once there, a new set of goggles and the unrelenting support of his family saw him find an avenue back to a playing career that saw him play to a level where he could retire again. This time was dferent, it was on his own terms. It was always sport for Ian McKinley. His father Horace was captain of both Trinity College Dublin and Old Wesley rugby teams, his mother Pam played hockey. The youngest of four, began his sporting adventure on the Gaelic field, at the age of nine, with leading Dublin club Kilmacud Crokes. When the club won a first ever All-Ireland U Feacuteile title in , Ian was centre back. Behind in the corner was Rory OCarroll who would later pick up two All-Stars as part of Dublins all-conquering blue wave. The fulcrum of the attack was none other than Ireland rugby international Ian Madigan. googletag.cmd.push “That was by background, even though I always wanted to play rugby,” McKinley points out. The back garden of the family home was a haven for kicking goals and scoring tries, but it wasnt until he went to secondary school that his rugby came on the radar. St Columbas College wasnt a rugby superpower, but it gave Ian a footing. He played Gaelic football for Dublin underage teams as far as U, before it was time to decide which route to go down “I made a decision in my last year of school, which way to go and my heart was with rugby,” points out Ian, who was awarded a rugby scholarship at UCD.     The day after his last exam in St Columbas, near the home and close to Dublins Marlay Park, he was accepted into the Leinster Rugby Academy and trained with stars like Brian ODriscoll. “Youd be training with the boys youd been watching on telly for the last  years,” he added. “It was a baptism of fire and you have to learn fairly quickly.” Just when all the pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place, a freak injury in UCDs top of the table clash, at home to Lansdowne, turned Ians world upside down. “I got a boot from my teammate who stamped on my face, his stud went into my eye and burst my eyeball. It was a strange one to say the least”, he recalls. After being rushed to hospital, he received emergency surgery and remained there for a week. “The surgeon was incredible,” states Ian, who had  percent of the sight back in his eye inside six months and was back training with Leinster ahead of the new season. There was another setback to follow. In his documentary Look Beyond, on Amazon Prime, Ian recalls going to kick a conversion after a Leinster try and the ball being more fuzzy than normal. It was a result of a developing cataract and later a detached retina left him, at the age of , with no vision in his left eye. “I spoke with Joe Schmidt and said I cant continue as my eye was really sore and to play out-half with  percent vision would be too tricky,” adds Ian. Getting his good eye gouged on the first game of his comeback led to the alarm bells ringing. “I thought I am never going to step onto a rugby field again without protecting my eyes. Rugby is a big part of my le, but it is not my whole le.” Ian is thankful for Leinster who kept him on board with work experience where he got a taste for coaching some of the junior teams. He loved coaching, but playing was the ultimate goal, the childhood dream of playing in the garden, thinking of playing on the big stage. “Thats what was eating me up, not fulfilling my potential...to stop at  was pretty hard,” he said. *** It was time for a fresh start. New Zealand or Australia would be too far, but he just wanted to get away from Ireland, somewhere completely dferent. The call came from Udine close to the Italian border with Slovenia. Leonorso offered him an opportunity to coach. His girlfriend Cordelia Mulholland, now his we, travelled with him on a new chapter in their le. “It just seemed like a chance to learn a new language, to how rugby is viewed...I fell in love with the place, I still love the place,” explains Ian. The weather, food and wine werent bad either. In , following a conversation with his brother Philip, thoughts flickered to the possibility of prototyping rugby goggles. By January the following year, Ian had acquired the first pair and was keen to test them out. On a wet night in action for Leonorso, the goggles passed the test. His muck-clad body was irrelevant, Ian was back playing rugby on a night of redemption. As his form picked up, semi- professional side Viadana came calling and hed later become the clubs captain. Hed later play PRO rugby with Zebre, before getting snapped up with Benetton Treviso. McKinleys meandering path had also met another roadblock. France, England and Ireland didnt accept the goggles as being safe for use. Zebre were due to play a game in Ireland, but a letter of request, to weaar the goggles, was rejected. It was time for clan McKinley to join forces on a campaign of meetings, petitions and ious appeals before eventually getting the goggles over the line and accepted. “They give me confidence that nothing was going to happen to my other eye,” Ian states. “It made my vision a little bit worse...the padding meant I could see  degrees less. People think it enhanced my vision, it made it worse.” There was time for one more step. Having played three years in Italy and while having played for and captained Ireland Us, he didnt play senior and was eligible for the Italian national team. With a nine-game losing streak hanging over them, Italian boss, the former Ireland player, Conor OShea handed McKinley his international debut against Fiji. Leading -, he marked his first outing with a late penalty in one of nine international appearances. Another one was against his native Ireland the following year in Chicagos Soldier Field. When his contract with Treviso expired last year and thoughts turned to the future. He now lives in Cordelias native Bellaghy. The couple welcomed their son Malachy into the world last December. On the rugby front, McKinley – who had spent time coaching under John Andrew at both Ballymena and Rainey - began to ponder. Was  his last dance  “It is not something you think of all of a sudden, it is your whole livelihood, it takes over your le,” he said of his decision to retire a second and final time. “All you can focus on is getting your body right, your mind right for the week. There is no rest time and you are constantly on the go. “It was something I reflected on,” Ian continued. “I said to myself when I initially went back and played and was lucky enough to play rugby a second time, I wanted to retire on my own terms and at as high a level as I possibly can.” Champions Cup. PRO. Six Nations. Those three boxes have been ticked, with the landscape around the next corner uncertain. “I can be very content with whats happened,” he sums up. “The biggest thing is that you have thousands of players using these goggles now...which has been the biggest triumph out of all of this. You have kids and adults that are now participating in rugby, which has been amazing.” Retiring is never easy. But McKinley has never been one to sit still. Monday, April  and getting Rainey out in groups of  to begin training for the new season is the next step. The new adventure excites him. “Its nice, having been in a professional environment since  , to go back to grass-roots rugby, to touch base again with why you started rugby,” he concludes. Rainey have made quite the catch.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While it seemed the rebuild of the R would take signicantly longer than the father and son team anticipated, Car SOS changed all that after Brianrsquos daughter, Libby, contacted the programme makers who were quick to realise the signicance and history of the car the McKay family now owned.Gerard said the road to the Car SOS reveal at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch at the end of last summer began in  when a family friend alerted them to the whereabouts of the iconic car mdash which was lying on its side mdash in a scrapyard in Crossmaglen.ldquoWe did not know the full history of the car at this stage, but we did know that it was famous across Ireland as it was driven by John Moloney, whom I used to watch driving it at Mondello Park when I was much younger, he explained.ldquoJohn was was very successful and won a number of Irish Rally Championships with the R which was one of the first of its kind to compete in Ireland.ldquoWhen Dad and I bought the car it was a shell. I had always wanted to get my hands on Moloneyrsquos red and white R and was delighted to discover it was the very one that we now owned. While it needed major surgery, I was nonetheless delighted to have a car with such pedigree. However, we did not know the full history of the R at that stage.Gerard explained that when the car was brought home, neither he nor his father knew about the link with David Gillanders and what R they really had on their hands.ldquoA family friend from Leitrim, Eamonn McAleenan, initially told us about the car and when we got it back to Loughinisland he told us it was famous. When we replied, lsquoWe know, it was John Moloneyrsquosrsquo, Eamonn said, lsquoNo, I mean it is really famousrsquo and revealed that it was David Gillanders car. We couldnrsquot believe it.ldquoThe rally community is very small and everyone knows about cars, where they came from and who owned and drove them. When Moloney racedthe car it was probably the talk of the country as it was an Austin Rover works car, but when we hauled it out of the scrapyard we had no idea what we had really bought.Gerard said his father knew who Eamonn was talking about and recalled seeing images of the car in the Motoring News magazine.ldquoWe did our homework and, sure enough, it was Gillanderrsquos R and we had this confirmed by someone inEngland who is something of an expert in the MGcars. We knew that we had the real deal, he continued.ldquoA mechanical manual came with the car which would help us get it back on the road again. It was pre-Facebook at this stage but when I put a photo of the car on the internet, it literally exploded with messages.ldquoIt is hard to believe that the car was in a scrapyard for  years. When we bought it in , the car had been stripped for parts and the shell was getting tired. When we got to the scrapyard it had been sitting on top of some tyres but had fallen over on to its side.Gerard said he was ldquodoing handstands as he had got his hands on Moloneyrsquos car, explaining that being the owner of the vehicle with his father ldquowas the ultimate for him. He said when he put the car on the internet many people commented that they thought Gillanders car had been lost.When it came to rebuilding the car, Gerard and his father had the engine, gearbox and two out of the three dfs. They ended up getting a third from a Peugeot  they purchased.With Gerard moving to England for five years, no work was done on the car which was left in a garage with a cover over it, but in  the R was moved from Loughinisland to his garage in Castlewellan.ldquoDad was a mechanic and I am a joiner by trade while another friend of mine, Frank McMullan, helped with the bodywork. We got the shell back into shape and then started getting the  on but Dad then had a stroke so the work stopped. For me, there were more important things to worry about. That was fine as restoring the R was always going to be a long-term project anyway. It was labour of love.Just weeks before last yearrsquos lockdown, Fuzz and Tim rocked up to take the R back to England for its makeover after being contacted by Gerardrsquos sister and with the team one week away from completing the job, work had to stop due to Covid-.ldquoIncredibly, the work on the car was completed within about six weeks as a -strong team was working on it. They also had a very firm foundation to start with which helped, Gerard explained.In the build-up to the big reveal, the McKay family was due to go to England at the end of last March, but this wasnrsquot possible due to lockdown restrictions, so the unveiling was put on hold until last August.However, Brian and Gerard had no idea what was happening and arrived at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel for a family meal. And they couldnrsquot believe their luck when they saw David Gillanders sitting in the reception area.They told the rally driver that they owned his car and when they all went outside and saw a television crew and Fuzz rocking up in the gleaming R, they thought it was a programme involving the famous Scottish driver.ldquoI recognised Tim right away as Dad and I watch Car SOS and was not surprised to see him as I thought everything was focused on Gillanders. Then Tim spoke to Dad and I by name which really threw me. Then he said it was our car.ldquoIt was a pretty surreal moment and when we got to take the car for a drive it was incredible. The heat and noise of one of the most powerful rally car engines on the planet sitting over your left shoulder is an amazing feeling.ldquoWhat we now have is a museum quality car which is incredible and it certainly wonrsquot be raced. We will take it to shows and maybe some demonstration runs, but that will be it. Its competition days are over.Gerard added: ldquoThe reveal of the car was very emotional for Dad who thought all his Christmases had come at once. The R is everything we expected and more. Dad thought he would never have seen the car finished and is running about ashe is  again.ldquoI always thought that one day I would have been able to get the car back on the road as a petrol head never gives up on his dream. While I am sure I would have achieved my goal, what the Car SOS team has done is miraculous.ldquoWe are just a normal family which is car mad. Fuzz and Tim are gentlemen and a pleasure to work with. They are so down to earth and we canrsquot thank them or the Car SOS team enough. They were brilliant..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Coach.jpg","title":"Coach Conor gets call up  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH goalkeeper Conor Brennan has been helping Northern Irelandrsquos U-s in a training camp ahead of their Euro qualiers later this year.The Glasgow Rangers Academy goalkeeping coach was drafted into newly appointed manager Gerard Lyttlersquos set-up after former Manchester United lsquokeeper Roy Carroll was required for duties with the senior squad.ldquoGerard gave me a ring to seeI could fly over from Scotland after Roy got the call up to help with the seniors, he said.ldquoI spoke to Rangers as I obviously am firstly employed with them, but they were more than happy for me to move on over. Therersquos three lads in the international team who are also on Rangers U- set up so I could keep an eye on them as well.Brennanwho also plays for East Kilbride FC in Scotlandrsquos Lowland Football League, joined the back room staff to help benefit the U- team after their Euro campaign was cancelled due to the Covid- pandemic.The team was set to play three qualiers in Sweden throughout March but those were cancelled. The camp was used ahead of the sides Euro  qualiers which take place in October.ldquoI was analysing what the team could do. A lot of stuff I was doing with them wasvery basic, such as handling and reflex drills. Some people may think that they should be the best in the country at their age but we are in the middle of a pandemic so its important to have that in your mind.ldquoNot all of the team are getting the game time they need through no fault of their own.The recent camp lasted from Monday to Friday, with manager Lyttle drafting in fellow countryman and former Rangers defender Gareth McAuley alongside the Killyleagh custodian.ldquoGarethrsquos experience and his calibre was great for the lads, they all grew up watching him play and now hersquos looking ahead to mould the future said Brennan.ldquoThe U-s are trying to get a few friendlies alongside a few training camps to keep busy. Gerard is trying to bring new players and staff together to see what the people are about. Having Gareth involved in the team is a no brainer.Brennan had the opportunity to work with promising young goalkeepers Conor Manderson from Portsmouth FC, and Dungannon Swtsrsquo Conner Bryne during the camp.Northampton Townrsquos Dylan Berry had to withdrawal from the camp after being called up to his clubrsquos senior team.ldquoThe young lsquokeepers are showing a lot of promise, this is why Gerard arranged the camp, Brennan continued. We want them to develop into future senior team internationals and have them playing at the highest level possible.As for the Killyleagh man himself, Brennan highlighted his aspirations for both his own playing and coaching career.ldquoI want to continue to keep doing as I am doing. People forget because of my coaching that I am still a player. I still enjoy the feeling of getting out on the pitch and playing. Irsquom only , soi play my cards right I could be playing for at least another ten years.Scotlandrsquos Lowland League recently made the decision to end this season on a points per game basis after discussions with the Scottish FA took place.ldquoI am disappointed that the season at East Kilbride ended. It was a real sickener as we were going to give it a right good go, but ultimately what can we do. The club has been brilliant for me and I definitely want to get back there next season.Brennan has gone from strength to strength with Rangers as he enters his fourth coaching season at the Glasgow club.ldquoIts going really well at my forth season at Rangers. In terms of my set up, Irsquom the U- goalkeeping coach and itrsquos a job I love doing and Irsquom passionate about it.ldquoI was the youngest in the UK to have my Uefa goalkeeping A licence, so that was a big help in attracting Rangers.ldquoI am currently completing my outfield Uefa A licence which will add another string to my bow and I eventually aim to have a Uefa pro A licence a few years down the line.Brennan has left his door open for any future offers to assist with the international squad, insisting he is happy to help in any way he can where possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Engineer.jpg","title":"Engineer was legend in motor sport  ","story":"JAMES Nathaniel Brown served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before the Second World War, later moving to work for the former Ulster Transport Authority.In late  he opened his Antrim Road garage in Ballynahinch with a loan from a family friend and what a sound investment it proved to be, spawning a long and distinguished family connection with motorcycle sport of ious types.Not long after his business opened, James Nathaniel Brown mdash or JN as he was affectionately known mdash developed a business and social relationship with the Herron family from Leitrim, outside Castlewellan.And the sports connection evolved from here when Jimmy and Wilfred Herron began to take an interest in competition in the form of grass track racing, with JN putting his considerable engineering skills to good use in preparing the machinery for the brothers.However, the grass tracking phase was fairly short lived, with the Herron boys turning their attention to road racing and Jimmy consistently obtaining good results, But he was somewhat outshone by Wilfred who in his first season in  developed at a spectacular pace, going from novice to a force to be reckoned with.The swtness of his rise through the ranks is illustrated by the result from the  North West  road race when, riding a cc Gold Star BSA, he finished third behind very distinguished international company in the shape of Jackie Wood and Bob Brown, the Australian who later rode works Matchless, Gilera and Honda machinery.Later that same year a Norton Featherbed was acquired just after the TT and, some six weeks later, Wilfie was in a stunning fth place in the World Championship Ulster Grand Prix when a split petrol tank forced race officials to black flag him with several laps to go.Wilfie subsequently finished that season tied on points with Louis Carter for the Walter Rusk trophy which was in effect the Irish road-race championship, with Jimmy backing this effort up by finishing fourth in the championship which covered all classes.In , Wilfie confirmed this form was no fluke by winning the Irish Championship, including a fth place finish at the Ulster Grand Prix to score two world championship points. He then repeated the feat in , scoring consistently all over Ireland.At this stage, Jimmy was always a top contender in the cc class and along with brother Wilfie the duo were a force to be reckoned with.The speed and reliability of the brothersrsquo machinery during this spell was clear proof of JN Brownrsquos meticulous approach to preparation and outstanding ability in the tuning stakes, establishing a reputation whichwas to be enhanced over the following years.From  on, business pressures enforced a break from competition for the Herron brothers but JNrsquos enthusiasm was undiminished and he turned his attention to the grass track and motocross scene and it was during this phase that he became more and more involved with engine development, compared to just preparation.JN began this era with a youngster by the name of Mervyn McConkey who would progress to legendary status in grass track and scrambling history, becoming Irish champion in every capacity class available. A feat that no one has ever matched.The machine chosen for this venture was the Triumph Tiger Cub, the cc class being very popular in Ireland for all types of racing and where the legendary Joey Dunlop started his illustrious career.McConkey showed great potential right from the word go and within weeks of his first race was starting to win on a regular basis. Indeed, before long he was a top contender in the cc, cc, cc and cc classes and there were occasions when he won every race he entered at a given meeting, with a seasonrsquos tally of wins almost topping the  mark.All this was of course greatly helped by JN Brownrsquos engine tuning and modication programme, with the development aspect of his activities accelerated with the acquisition of a cc BSA C-.Indeed, so successful was the Brown McConkey alliance that results came to the notice of the BSA factory in the shape of the companyrsquos competitions department manager Brian Martin, with whom JN established a successful and long-lived development partnership.The factory C-s were being successfully campaigned by future world champion Jeff Smith and Saturday afternoon scrambles were regularly televised on BBCrsquos Grandstand programme.JN would send to the factory details of modications which had proved successful in Ireland and, of course,something was tried and failed in Ireland then the factory avoided any adverse publicity. Over the followings number of seasons BSA quietly supplied free machinery each season for use as a development test bed.In addition, JN also began a series of specials by increasing engine capacities, using the time honoured lsquobitzarsquo method of adapting separate parts of other engines to alter bore and stroke measurements and so achieve the desired capacity.Examples of this process were cc and cc specials, both of which were successfully campaigned by McConkey and his son Junior Brown.The BSA factory was kept informed and developed the works machinery along similar lines in terms of cylinder capacities used. The high point of factory development came with Jeff Smith becoming World Champion in  and again in , with both championships achieved using cc engines which confirm the signicant input from the Ballynahinch engineer.The next chapter in JNrsquos story emanated in a roundabout way from the USA.Triumph had long had a large part of their export sales in America whose major race was the prestigious Daytona  which had become something of a Harley Davidson benefit, with the manufacturer taking  successive wins from  onwards.SuccessThis success was largely attributable to Harleyrsquos capacity advantage in running cc machines, whereas the overhead valve equipped opposition were restricted to a cc limit.Triumph dealers in America began pressing the factory for some more race development on the T model being used at Daytona, but this request received a cool reception from MD Edward Turner.Luckily enough, Triumphrsquos head of development, the brilliant Doug Hele, took up the gauntlet and with his dedicated team and working largely in their own time, undertook the race development work.They eventually reached the stage where they scooped the  and  Daytona events with riders Gary Nixon and Buddy Elmore and the production T was re-christened the Daytona model. Further work enabled Percy Tait to record podium places in the World Championship Grand Prix series.Back in Ballynahinch, JN began to see this as a challenge and reckoned he could do as well as the factory, or maybe even better.His son, John, bought a second-hand T for his father to work his magic on and, to house the engine, a frame and cycle parts from a  World Championship winning cc Mondial were bought from George Purvis. It subsequently transpired that George had actually rebuilt the frame. After considerable development work had been carried out performance figures were indeed impressive with the motor producing approximately  BHP at , RPM, comparing very favourably with the fully race designed and developed Manx Norton and Matchless G engines favoured by the majority of top riders of that era.Consider also that the published factory figures for the  T production bike was  BHP at , RPM, with top speed quoted as  MPH ndash the Brown racer, pulling a tall gearing, could hit mph.JNrsquos work paid off in quite spectacular fashion at the  Tandragee  where Mervyn McConkey finished second to the late great Brian Steenson on a G Seely and ahead of that seasonrsquos cc Irish road race champion on a Manx Norton mdash not a bad result for a grass  scrambles specialist using a production based engine.Some year later, I spoke to road racer Ian McGregor. Ian was small in stature, but huge in his racing achievements and said he loved riding that bike as it was small enough to be comfortable for his size, handled well and was very quick.For the following three or four seasons, the Triumph was ridden, with ying degrees of success, by a number of top road racers including Wilfie Herron, Tom Herron Whilst the machine was undoubtedly very quick and handled well, it proved to be a bit fragile. Hardly surprising, considering the very advanced state of tune applied to what was still basically a production roadster.In  Wilfie bought a Norton Commando for competition in the recently introduced cc class. He approached JN with a view to having the Brown magic applied to the preparation of the machine and this wasduly carried out, once again to startling effect.The combination which had proved so successful nearly  years before resumed in full swing. For the following couple of seasons Wilfie was once again the man to beat in his chosen class with a record of something like  wins from  races over this outstandingly successful period.Through the late s, the development of two-stroke machinery drove on and expanded into the higher capacity classes so successfully that it became a near impossibility to campaign a four-stroke with any hope of consistent success.Having been a dedicated four-stroke fan for so many years, the two-stroke dominance was almost an anathema to JN and, after a brief spell working with a Bultaco Pursang, he drted from active participation in the motorcycling scene, but did continue with some consultancy work with Cosworth regarding F car engines.In the late seventies and eighties JN and my brother, John, sponsored my rallycross sprint hillclimb Mini. With development help from JN, I was fortunate to quickly become a front runner. JN always said that % of winning is done in the workshop before the race meetings on the Saturday.In later years JN became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve per cylinder engine and cylinder head. Jim was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head, who was technical director of the Williams F team.JN was also great friends with the Rev Harold Good who later became Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, with the Brown family running motorsport events at Martinrsquos Quarry and McCormackrsquos Quarry in the eighties in Ballynahinch in aid of the local Methodist church building fund.Sadly, for the last two or three years of his le JN had dementia and found things dficult given the active le he had lived.His funeral in  was one of the largest ever seen at Lough Inch Cemetery in Ballynahinch and was attended by motorcyclists from far and near. Also in attendance and Formula  greats like Sir Frank Williams, Sir Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.I will always remember JN as a great innovative pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative. The likes we will never see again.Meanwhile, the Brian Steenson Memorial Group is planning to have a chat show and talk about the le and work of JN Brown later this year when lockdown restrictions ease and the group. The group will also have a new memorial cup this year dedicated to JN which has been donated by his son Junior.The Brian Steenson group would like to wish founder member Trevor Lindsay best wishes as he recovers from illness, with their thoughts also with his we Margaret and family at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 11%2C 2001  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash Two of Down Districtrsquos biggest visitor attractions will be open this weekend, as moves continue to prevent the collapse of the Easter tourist season.The Department of Agriculture has bowed to signicant tourist industry pressure and agreed to reopen both Tollymore and Castlewellan Forest Parks which draw thousands of day trippers to the area.Both parks attract thousands of visitors over Easter and also boast the arearsquos largest touring caravan sites which are heavily used over the Easter period.Confirmation the gates at both Tollymore and Castlewellan are to open for business again came on Monday afternoon, just hours after the Department of Agriculture had warned they would remain closed. However, pressure was stepped up when it was revealed that staffing problems, and not the foot and mouth crisis, was the main reason for the closures.Virtually all the forest park staff are away on disinfecting duties, mainly at ports and border crossings and Department officials felt they could not be spared to open the forests.ARDGLASS ndash A yard of ale, talent contest and car pulling competitions are the stuff of which traditional summer festivals are made.And according to the newly elected committee set up to bring Ardglass Festival back to le, these are examples of the old fashioned games most people prefer.The committee which was elected following the grouprsquos annual general meeting recently, has already announced the revival of the annual event which has not been staged since .The festival, which was one of the most popular events in the district for several years, was cancelled because of lack of interest but  local people have now volunteered to organise an events programme once again this year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash A Ballynahinch councillor is this week standing by his claims that thousands more vehicles are passing through Ballynahinch each day than officially acknowledged.Mr Francis Casement said while he is not prepared to reveal the source of his information, he says the figure he produced three weeks ago were compiled by the Roads Service and are accurate.The SDLP councillor produced daily traffic figures for several parts of the town which showed that over , vehicles pass through High Street.His comments come one week after Down Districtrsquos Divisional Roads Manager, Mr Sean Price, wrote to the Down Recorder, claiming the figures quoted by the local councillor in March were ldquocompletely erroneous and not based on departmental surveys.Mr Price said he has already informed Mr Casement about this and asked him to be more precise in ldquoidentying the source to enable him to shed some light on the confusion the figures have created.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Planning Service has ruled there will not be a public inquiry into one of the biggest private housing developments ever proposed for Down District.Public scrutiny of an ambitious poundm plan to build over  new homes and a marina at the Gocean area in Killyleagh had been widely expected, but planning officials have decided against an inquiry.They confirmed on Monday afternoon that the application by Ravenblack Developments, which was being dealt with by senior planners in Belfast, has been passed back to planners in Downpatrick. They will now re-examine the proposal before making their views known to local councillors.It has been widely expected the inquiry would have taken place next year, but the fact that it has not been ordered could result in construction work on the project beginning sooner than expected, provided planning permission is granted.DOWNPATRICK ndash A group of residents in Downpatrick are seeking urgent talks over a proposal to build  new homes in the town.The Ardglass Road residents are hoping to meet senior planning officials and Roads Service engineers to discuss what will be Downpatrickrsquos largest building project for several years.They say while they have no objections to the proposal to build several hundred new homes, they do have concerns about the increase in the amount of traffic the development will generate.Councillor Mrs Anne Trainor said the existing roads infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the demands being placed on it and will not be able to cope with more traffic.She admits while the construction of the homes will be good news for the local economy, shops, schools and churches, it is important the existing roads network is upgraded.Details of the scheme to build the new homes on land formerly owned by the Down Lisburn Trust was made public last week and local residents has been given two weeks to register any opinions.The new homes are to be built by the Ballygowan firm of Micwall Developments and the scheme is due to receive its public launch in August or September.BALLYCULTER ndash Organic chickens bred at a Ballyculter farm could soon be featuring on supermarket shelves across the Province.The new initiative, which is being spearheaded by organic farmer Dr John Orr, is being backed by the Crossgar firm of Bells Poultry, which hopes to take its first delivery of free-range chickens later this week.By Friday the birds will be on sale in butcherrsquos shops in Belfast and Dublin andsuccessful, the move to breed organic chickens locally could knock the stuffing out of European competition.The plan was hatched several months ago and Mr Adrian Gunn the agricultural manager with the Crossgar firm, believes the market is ready for an increase in the number of organic chickens.He said with an increasing number of consumers turning to organic products, the time is right to move in this direction and supply them with organic poultry products.STRANGFORD ndash Local school children braved the April showers on Monday to take part in a historic event.Armed with wellington boots and spades, pupils and teachers from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Strangford joined members of the Woodland Trust at Compass Hill outside Strangford, to plant the first trees of the new millennium woodland.Monday was the first stage of the project which saw the children helping to plant a new woodland which has been envisaged for them when they grow up.A new footpath is being built which leads to the Lough shore with breathtaking views from Compass Hill and the Tea House.The woodland and hedges which are being planted have been specially chosen to encourage bird and insect populations and work is currently underway to clean and restore the old Japanese pond.A number of relaxation areas have also been pinpointed for the positioning of seats, along with wooden sculptures which pupils at the local schools helped design.The sculptures of woodland animals have poems, which were written by the children, beautully carved below them and will be there for further generations to admire.CASTLWELLAN ndash Castlewellanrsquos famous May Day horse fair, which has been a feature of le in the market town for generations, has fallen victim to the foot and mouth crisis.Down Council had this week ruled that the traditional horse fair, which attracts hundreds of people of Castlewellan, cannot go-ahead on May .The decisions to cancel the event was taken at a special meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night, but politicians have agreed to allow the fair to proceed on May .They argue it would be unwise to allow people from rural areas to meet in large numbers in Castlewellan for the annual May Day fair and to bring horses in to Castlewellan.But the politicians have given a guarantee they will continue to monitor the current situation and have agreed thatcircumstances change and new directives are issued by the Department of Agriculture, the horse fair could proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7Apr2021-Funnyman.jpg","title":"Funnyman Brian compiles humorous stories  ","story":"FOR over  years Brian Johnston has been involved in entertainment, compering concerts and appearing at after dinner s and events for numerous church, charitable and other organisations throughout the province and further afield.Ten years ago Brian, who lives near Temple, published a collection of the stories he has told over the years.

I was just putting thoughts down and all the lines came out in rhyme, she said.ldquoFor the two years I was sitting here at home, I was vegetating, which is not like me. I didnrsquot want to do anything. I knew Ryan would have said to me, lsquoCome on Mum, catch yourself onrsquo.Just four months before Ryan died, the mother of two lost her father.One of the poems in the collection is based on the special relationship between them both.ldquoWe understood that Daddy at  had a good innings but the worst of it all was that he and Ryan were such good friends and so close, she explained.ldquoI got Ryan cremated but his ashes lie with his Papa so they are together and friends forever now. Knowing the two of them are together has helped me.ldquoIt was a very traumatic time, but losing a son has been the ultimate and most horric experience I can ever express to anyone, especially by the means in which it was done.ldquoNot only that, one of the boys who did it is now appealing his sentence. He only got four and a half years in prison and the rest out on licence. That shows there is no remorse. If I had done something like that, I would be saying, lsquoRight lock me uprsquo, I would be horried.ldquoThe judicial system in this country is ridiculous. Four years for murdering someone  I know they say it wasnrsquot murder but it was in the end.Another poem, called The Gt, is about a locket of her sonrsquos hair that she kisses every morning to help her get through the day.Jayne was in New Zealand visiting her daughter Rebecca, who had just had her first baby at the time of the attack on her son.ldquoIt took me three days to travel back from New Zealand, knowing my son was seriously ill in hospital. I was literally shaking the whole time, she recalled.ldquoRyanrsquos father, my ex husband Gordon, had flown from England to be with him. We both sat by his bedside when Ryan was stable enough for us to be in the room.ldquoI canrsquot commend the ICU team of doctors and nurses enough who worked with my son. They were amazing but, unfortunately, Ryanrsquos brain injury was too severe.Jayne, who is working on a second book of poems, says of her son: ldquoRyan was actually very shy but once you got to know him, he was always joking around and had a big smile on his face.

And that their parents are also almost unaffected, with Professor John Ioannidis, professor of Epidemiology and Statistics at Stanford University placing the probability of survival for people under  after infection at .%.And the Northern Ireland Public Health Agency reports that schools are not major sources of transmission.Furthermore the world’s leading scientists state that asymptomatic transmission is insignicant or zero.Education and the socialisation aspects of it cannot take place behind a mask. It requires unimpeded visual and oral communication. Good teaching involves a iety of teaching strategies to take account of the dferent learning styles of pupils, some learn best by doing, some by looking and some by listening. It involves inter-activity, group work, team work, discussion, detailed complex explanation-imagine a question and answer session or a drama lesson or a reading or a language lesson or a poetry reading or oracy or a role play session or a singing lesson with a mask. Choirs, drama productions, sport all play an important part in children’s education. Masks make important engagement with outside agents — authors, sports coaches, careers officers, counsellors, translators, actors, artists — also impossible. This is not school.Children with Special Educational Needs and children who are challenged by education require personal contact with their teacher. Facial expressions provide reinforcement and visual clues. Teachers often assess the degree of understanding of their teaching from the facial expressions of their pupils, thus leading to better targeted teaching. Expressions are essential too to gauge emotions and for teachers to detect essential non verbal communication around deep feelings.In addition to loss of learning, there are the negative effects. In the German study, the most frequently reported side effects of masks were irritability, headaches, dficulty concentrating, less cheerfulness, fatigue and anxiety. In Sweden the Public Health Agency’s standpoint is “Children are not the drivers [of infection] in this epidemic”.\u2028“the benefit of masks is not large enough to outweigh the downside of reduced learning and communication in the classroom”.How would you rather your child was educated The UN Convention of Human Rights of the Child “in all actions concerning children…undertaken by public institutions…the best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration”.We are not doing this.

Police quelled crowds of  people on either side of the peace line and deployed six AEPs, a type of plastic bullet, as well as arresting two men, aged  and , on suspicion of riotous behaviour.Secretary of State Brandon Lewis was due to arrive in Northern Ireland later to hold emergency talks with the main political parties, as well as faith and community leaders.Mr Lewis will meet with First Minister Arlene Foster, from the DUP, and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, from Sinn Fein, on Thursday afternoon, the PA news agency understands.He has urged all communities to work together to end the violence, saying the determination to move on from the Troubles could not be “crushed by a small minority”.There have been six consecutive nights of violence across Northern Ireland.Sir Keir Starmer has urged Boris Johnson to “step up” and convene all-party talks, as he noted unionist concerns that the Prime Minister’s Brexit promises were not being kept.Earlier, ministers in the Stormont Executive condemned the violence and Stormont MLAs unanimously passed a motion calling for an end to the disorder.In a joint statement, the five-party Executive said: “While our political positions are very dferent on many issues, we are all united in our support for law and order and we collectively state our support for policing and for the police officers who have been putting themselves in harm’s way to protect others.“We, and our departments, will continue to work together to maximise the support we can give to communities and the PSNI to prevent further violence and unrest.”More than  PSNI officers have been injured since the violence started last week.The Stormont Assembly was recalled from Easter recess for an emergency sitting following a motion put forward by Ms Long calling for MLAs to unequivocally condemn those involved and support the rule of law.Speaking during the Assembly debate, DUP leader Mrs Foster said the scenes witnessed were “totally unacceptable”.The First Minister said the injuries to police officers, harm to Northern Ireland’s image and people’s property had taken the region backwards.She said that the future required political leadership.The PSNI has said it intends to review footage to identy those involved in violence.Ms O’Neill said the violence was dangerous and unacceptable.She said illegal loyalist paramilitaries and criminal elements were influencing young people and orchestrating the violence.“They are holding back their own people and they are holding back their own community,” she said.But Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts later said during a press conference that he could not confirm whether paramilitary groups were involved in recent riots.“I can’t confirm the involvement of paramilitaries but the orchestration of last night’s disorder and the previous nights is the subject of investigation,” he said during a press conference at PSNI headquarters in Belfast.“The scale of the disorder last night was at a scale that we have not seen in recent years in Belfast or further afield.“The fact that it was sectarian violence involving large groups on both sides is not something we have seen in recent years. We believe there was a level of pre-planning.”An estimated  people gathered on either side on the Lanark Way peace wall gates from pm, which escalated to “signicant disorder”.The violence is unfolding at a time of increasing rancour in the political sphere amid tensions over Brexit’s Irish Sea trade border and the fallout from the police’s handling of a mass republican funeral that took place during pandemic restrictions last year.As rioting has flared across Northern Ireland, all four main unionist parties continue to call for PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to quit over how his service dealt with the funeral of former IRA leader Bobby Storey.Unionists are furious at a decision by prosecutors not to take action against  Sinn Fein politicians, including Ms O’Neill, for attending the funeral – a decision partly related to the fact that police had engaged with organisers before the event that drew , people on to the streets.Mr Byrne has vowed not to resign and has signalled a desire to engage with people who have concerns about policing in the region.Wednesday’s scenes of violence flooded social media and prompted UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to appeal for calm.He tweeted: “I am deeply concerned by the scenes of violence in Northern Ireland, especially attacks on PSNI who are protecting the public and businesses, attacks on a bus driver and the assault of a journalist.“The way to resolve dferences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.”---A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One of the defining elements of the Governments response to the spread of Covid- was the launch of emergency income support schemes to protect jobs.Back in March last year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or \"furlough\" scheme, to help firms struggling with the impact of the virus.By the end of May, just two months later, businesses had already put around , employments on furlough in the Vale of Glamorgan.At the same time, people in the area had made roughly , claims made under the separate Self-Employment Income Support Scheme.MORE NEWS:In January, , jobs were on furlough in the Vale of Glamorgan, with , reliant on the SEISS scheme.ONS figures show that in early March last year, ,people in the Vale of Glamorgan were claiming out-of-work benefits.By mid-January, that figure had risen nearly double to ,.The figures include those aged  to  on Jobseekerrsquos Allowance and some Universal Credit claimants, who are unemployed and seeking work or employed but with low earnings.The ONS has regularly cautioned that changes to Universal Credit in response to the virus mean more people can get the benefits while still being employed, which mean the figures cant be used to measure unemployment on a local basis.It also said a small number of people who can claim both JSA and UC could be counted twice.What about house prices The property market has also felt the impact of the pandemic, withthe average UK house price rising to a record pound, at the end of last year.The ONS saidGovernment support schemes, particularly the stamp duty holiday, may be a factor behind the national rise.But not everywhere saw a growth in house prices, however.Inthe Vale of Glamorgan, the average cost of a property was pound, in February, just before the Covid- crisis hit, according toLand Registry figures.By December, that had fallen to pound,ndasha decrease of less than .%.VaccinationsAfter an extremely dficult year for many of us, the vaccine rollout is providing a glimmer of hope for a le not bound by restrictions.Public Health Wales data shows , people in the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardf had received their first dose of a Covid- vaccine by March .More than  million people across the UK have had their first jab. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.

Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Irsquom opposed to this plan. Itrsquos a loss of open countryside yet again, and the big issue of course that wersquore concerned about in Llantwit Major is the impact on local infrastructure.ldquoWe have two surgeries in Llantwit Major: one is nearly falling down. Our leisure centre is over  years old it has never really been improved upon in that time. Our traffic is chock-a-block the roads are gridlocked at peak periods.ldquoWhorsquos going to live in these homes  Wersquore building more and more homes all the time, but there are so many homes already available.

About  per cent of the planned homes will be affordable.     Both sites would be accessed off of the Northern Access Road, also known as Fford Bro Tathan. This new road was built in  and , running from the B north of Boverton to the St Athan enterprise zone and Aston Martin factory.Planning officers responded to Cllr Johnrsquos concerns by pointing to the newly built road, as an example of new traffic infrastructure in the area and saying new residents of the proposed homes could help local shops by bringing them extra trade.A plan showing the layout of site A Picture: WYG Free to use for all LDRS partnersAn image showing the layout of the siteAnother concern was noise pollution: the eastern site is close to a firing range used by the Ministry of Defence. Councillors on the planning committee feared future residents could suffer from hearing loud gunfire. Planning officers said they could make noise complaints.David Harris, who lives in the local area, told the planning committee: ldquoThis site is located right opposite and within  metres of a live MOD firing range. This range can be used seven days a week, up to pm. Itrsquos regularly used.ldquoNo matter how much mitigation is used in the building fabric, you canrsquot reduce the exceptional noise of live gun fire when you have your windows open or when yoursquore in your garden. This fact alone makes this site totally inappropriate for residential development.Because the housing development is split into two sites, councillors voted on two separate planning applications, one for each site.The second application, for the eastern site, only narrowly passed a vote. Six councillors voted in favour of granting planning permission, and six voted against, with four abstaining. Planning officers warned refusing permission could risk a costly legal challenge.As the vote was tied, the chair of the planning committee, Cllr Jonathan Bird, used his casting vote to grant permission, effectively voting twice. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Labourrsquos shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon called for more clarity on the Governmentrsquos plans and a pledge for financial support for the industry.ldquoTime and again the UK Government have been devoid of strategy when it comes to protecting our borders against Covid, Mr McMahon said in a statement.ldquoAt a time when cases are rising across Europe and the threat of iants remains deeply worrying, we need a comprehensive hotel quarantine system, to help protect the gains of the vaccine. The first priority has to be keeping people safe.Mr McMahon demanded more details about the criteria by which the traffic light system would be decided, and said the Government ldquomust come up with a comprehensive financial support package for the aviation sector and its supply chain.The Business Travel Associationlambasted the report as ldquoyet another hammer blow for business travel, and called on the Government to ldquoat the very least maintain the furlough scheme for the travel industry until September.ldquoWhilst we welcome the acknowledgement of the importance of business and leisure travel to the UK economy, this theoretical framework provides no more certainty than the Prime Ministerrsquos brief comments on Monday, BTA CEO Clive Wratten said in a statement.ldquoThe traffic light system is something we have long campaigned for. However, it is only one piece of the jigsawthe aviation, business, and leisure travel industries are to survive.ldquoWe urgently ask the Government to at the very least maintain the current furlough scheme until September for the entire travel supply chain. This will hopefully enable us to contribute to UK plc as soon as it is safe to do so. vw,vw,px, px\"Labourrsquos Jim McMahon says the findings show the Government is short on strategy over the recovery of the travel industry from the pandemic Rory Boland, editor of industry publication Which  Travel, said the report was ldquoan important step towards resuming international travel but ldquofalls short in providing solutions, adding the current cost of Covid tests risked pricing people out of taking holidays.ldquoThere is also little detail on reassurances that destinations wonrsquot suddenly be moved from green to amber or red, putting travellers at risk of last-minute changes and unaffordable quarantine costs, he said in a statement.The Board of Airline Representatives in the UKwelcomed the report, saying it would help airlines prepare for theof international flying.ldquoClearly we would like the Government to sharpen their pencils on the plan in advance of implementation but the framework creates the building blocks to open up further through the built-in review periods, the boardrsquos CEO Dale Keller said in a statement.Mr Keller said BAR UK would also propose initiatives such as the acceptance of rapid lateral flow tests..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Calls for more solutions and cheaper tests follow Government travel report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
