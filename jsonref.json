They said they had been given no hand gel, no gloves, and limited access to hand-washing facilities, according to the trade union Unison. By Friday evening, all Lambeth libraries were closed.Anstice said he had also been contacted by frontline staff in branches that remain open “who are terrified by the contamination risks and report that the public are ignoring social distancing guidelines”.“The staff at Lambeth walked out over the health fears and I have been told another service only avoided the same fate on Saturday by closing quickly,” said Anstice. The lack of clear government instructions was, he said, was “no way to treat a national service with hundreds of millions of visitors per year, many of who are old and vulnerable”.Libraries Connected, formerly the Society of Chief Librarians, a charity that supports public libraries, has written to the government asking for library closures to be mandated. “Many are still operating in a situation that is increasingly confused and alarming for library staff and their communities and puts both groups at risk of infection. This situation will worsen if children, who are not in school, begin to use their local libraries to access computers and other learning resources,” says the letter, signed by the charity’s chief executive, Isobel Hunter, and its president, Mark Freeman.Hunter estimates that around 30 library services in Britain have at least some branches open. “Libraries by their nature are open, welcoming and very relaxed spaces, but they have a significant number of visitors who may be in high-risk health groups.” Librarians were being left in a difficult situation trying to serve the community while maintaining safe environments, she said.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in response to Hunter’s letter that it was right for councils to make their own decisions about library closures. “We know that some councils have decided that they need to close their physical library buildings, and that is fine,” it said. “However, we know that libraries can play a number of roles in the community. Therefore we wanted to ensure councils retained discretion to keep libraries open, albeit operating differently given government social distancing advice, where they felt that services could remain beneficial and be delivered safely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a5b8c9776f3301fe9f85c38a1bc910af819dc8/0_375_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8fd7687cd851e88a0960d864a59b37e","title":"coronavirus mervyn king presses rishi sunak over pay for self employed","story":"Coronavirus is ‘much more serious and difficult to cope with’ than 2008 financial crisisPressure is mounting on the government to boost its financial support package for Britain’s 5 million self-employed people, after the former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, called on ministers to take rapid action.Warning that the escalating crisis was a far more serious threat to the economy than the 2008 financial crash, when he led the response at Threadneedle Street, King said the government should give self-employed workers the same level of support as company employees as a minimum first step.“It’s a good starting point because it would be equivalent to the support that’s being given for paying wages. Whether we will need to go higher than that is something that’s impossible to judge today,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.King said further loans and tax breaks for the self-employed were required and told ministers to ignore the dramatic rise in public borrowing needed to pay for such steps.Saying a recession was inevitable as large parts of the economy are locked down to prevent the spread of the virus, he added: “You cannot blame the government for creating this contraction in activity, it is absolutely necessary. The question is how we help businesses and self employed people survive through to the end of the epidemic.”King’s intervention comes as almost 100 leading economists, including former advisers to the Labour leadership and heads of thinktanks and campaign groups including the New Economics Foundation, Autonomy and Tax Justice UK, signed a letter to the government urging faster and more far-reaching action. More than 50,000 freelancers and self-employed workers have also signed a petition to ministers calling for urgent help, warning that work is drying up and money is running short.Gig economy workers in the Independent Workers of Great Britain union are threatening legal action against the chancellor’s current “discriminatory” policy, while a survey of its members suggested half would keep working if they had symptoms.A spokesman for the Treasury said the government had taken unprecedented action to support jobs and the economy, and added: “We have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87d78d8ca6dd2151c4cd88d76184628a811aef58/0_0_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72374af187ede6e157078c1d07ac1980","title":"government considers forcing non essential shops to close reports coronavirus","story":"WH Smith refuses to bow to pressure from staff to close stores because of coronavirus The UK government is considering forcing the closure of all non-essential shops in an escalation of measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. A string of high street retailers have recently announced that they are closing all their stores.“The Govt considering next steps like closing non-essential retail or whether to start treating people flouting the stay at home advice as acting against the law – all being discussed – huge decisions, nothing final,” the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, tweeted on Monday.The government did not comment on the suggestion before the prime minister’s daily press conference.Many European countries and US states have forced the closure of all shops, with the exception of those deemed essential, such as supermarkets, other food retailers and pharmacies.Greggs, McDonald’s, Nando’s, Costa Coffee, Eat, Primark, Debenhams, Next and Waterstones, and The Works joined the growing list of restaurant chains and retailers closing all of their UK outlets as the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the UK hit 5,683 and claimed 281 lives.Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, said the bakery chain’s 2,050 shops would be closed by the end of Tuesday. “It is now clear that to protect our people and customers we need to go further and temporarily close our shops completely,” he said.Costa Coffee announced that 2,700 of its stores would close on Monday night. The chain said it would try to keep open some of its shops within hospitals and would give free coffee to NHS workers for the next two weeks.Debenhams said it was closing its 140 department stores in the UK and Ireland. Card Factory and Moss Bros followed with total closures. The Royal Horticultural Society and Squires Garden Centres closed their garden centres.However, WH Smith refused to bow to pressure from staff to close its doors. The chief executive, Carl Cowling, vowed to keep open its 1,200 stores and told workers the company was “positioning ourselves to government as an essential retailer”.Some WH Smith employees said they felt their health was being put at risk by the chain’s refusal to close. “I was shocked and appalled by how busy our store was on Saturday and people’s disregard for safety,” one member of staff said. “It’s putting the general public and ourselves at risk. We don’t want to be there, but we feel like we have to.”In a letter to staff last week, the WH Smith boss said: “In our high street stores, we have a retail offer that extends to every generation. We can provide essential products to our younger pre-school customers an unrivalled education officer with accompanying stationery range to children, teenagers and students a fantastic books offer for everyone and a news and magazines offer that can’t be beaten, enabling communities to access information and keep up to date with what is happening at the current time.”The prime minister has repeatedly called on the public to stay at home whenever possible and only venture out for essentials such as food or medicine. On Friday, he ordered all pubs, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and other venues to close. Restaurants and cafes were told they could continue to offer takeaway food and drink.People have been warned against any congregation in groups, even outdoors. Some have been ignoring this advice, prompting calls for Boris Johnson to take stronger action, including closing non-essential shops and calling on the police to disperse any gatherings.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Diane Wehrle, of Springboard, said: “The annual change represented an unprecedented decline in retail footfall that was three times greater than the worst result we have ever previously recorded.”Primark said its 376 stores in 12 countries would close until further notice. There are 189 Primark shops in the UK.Waterstones said it would close its 280 UK branches from Monday. Only hours previously, its chief executive, James Daunt, had said the bookstore chain was “no different to a supermarket or a pharmacy” and would stay open during the coronavirus shutdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8882f4e41f1a321a28914f0160cd288e59a34a0/345_0_7180_4308/master/7180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53a4f1db613435a8130f716a01641c5d","title":"sandwich chain eat closes permanently after 24 years","story":"Owner Pret a Manger shuts all 90 UK stores following heavy lossesThe struggling Eat sandwich chain will disappear permanently from the UK high street after its owners, Pret Manger, closed the doors of its remaining 90 branches.Most high-street coffee shop and restaurant chains have announced temporary closures because of government restrictions on social distancing, but it was confirmed on Monday that Eat’s closure was permanent.The company tweeted: “After 24 years of creating, making and serving real food, it is time for us to say goodbye.

It’s a political model that we should stick toI’m in two groups that have sprung up spontaneously online, for neighbours to help each other out: one on Facebook, the other on WhatsApp. Neither is remotely political, in the sense that nobody is discussing the government or its deficiencies. And you would never distinguish between the two in terms of generosity or creativity: there are mental health nurses offering Skype calls, people offering parking spaces and dog walking. And above all, and always, support for self-isolation: any shopping, any errands, anything at all, to maintain this state of confinement that only a fortnight ago would have felt impossible, and still feels so unnatural.The WhatsApp group, though, was organised by the local Labour party, and this is how it shows: it was organised by wards, which are much smaller than the entire borough – 10,000 people rather than 300,000. The ward immediately split into subgroups of two or three streets, and the leafleting began.This is what you always remember from a Labour childhood, the endless leafleting, the crushing sense of futility at popping another 300 flyers telling people how seriously your candidate takes buses. In a time of crisis, it is transformed: you don’t want to create an online community of people who all use the same social networks. You want to tell everybody. There is a huge amount of embedded knowledge about the process of activism, how to get round an estate where there’s an entry code, what phrases to use in the leaflet, how big the font should be. All guardedness is jettisoned, with people freely giving out their numbers and addresses to strangers.There is a lot of regular, worldly expertise – a nurse, a shrink and a vet on one scabby road – who can scotch operational rumours that circulate quite freely on Facebook (“wear gloves”, the round robins say but gloves are the same as hands, in hygiene terms. And at least hands, you can wash). You could predict from miles away that there would be a lot of local knowledge, but it is still so surprising in its particulars – there’s a nunnery in the road perpendicular to mine, which everyone has always known, because of the nuns. But it was the activists who knew that it was also a hospice, housing 176 terminally ill people, and it was that tiny local support group that started putting together a rota for checking what they need. Not every member knows every other in a Labour ward, but there’s one person who everybody knows, and she (it’s always a she) carries a lot of weight, maybe because she doesn’t swing it. She can shoot down a misjudged idea with an emoji. In this group of very mild, sometimes online-only acquaintanceship, there is a huge amount of love.Hoaxes and hysteria are the condiments of any emergency: presumably there’s malice in their creation, which is depressing, but I understand why people believe and spread them. We are in this insistently eerie state of constantly checking the news, only to find it hasn’t changed, except to worsen. This puts us all in a passive, suspended state. If you can find movement in events, you can think yourself ahead of them. Hence this slew of rumours: the army’s on the streets, the shops are running out of food, this guy knows a guy who works in RBS, and he says national quarantine by 5pm, my friend who’s a nurse says don’t drink anything with ice in it, and hold your breath while counting to 10. They spread pretty much unchecked on open forums, but are shot down with precision in tighter groups.It is not relevant what the politics are of this ground army it could be any group, the Women’s Institute, the RNIB. What is relevant is that the ground army exists, and is confronted with a challenge it is uniquely placed to meet. The moral act would be for all Labour leadership candidates to come out and say: the election will go ahead, it’s all online, but the campaign is over. You all know who you’re voting for. Redeploy the phone-bankers to talk about other things cross-pollinate ideas show solidarity think about more organised ways to support the frontline workers and people who are isolated shoot the breeze. The membership base has been the site of deep connections, knowledge and trust for many decades, counterpoised always by the amount of energy it spent talking about, and finding differences within itself. Members have already relinquished that second pastime entirely, and the leadership candidates should do the same.We already know, I think, that we’re not going back to who we were before: a nation that could wind itself up into bitter hatreds over flimsy concepts, that took “pragmatism” to mean economic constraint over human generosity.“Concentrate on the future” is what people say under lockdown, in France, in Italy, when pressed for advice on how to stay sane. They don’t mean, “think about the time when the bars are open again, when we can hug one another for no reason” they mean, when we rebuild it, what do we want life to look like?Politics has already gone far beyond our previous understanding of it as a set of performative oppositions and set itself to the urgent question: now that we suddenly know how much we care about one another, what action does that demand? In the immediate term, the answer is very obvious, counterintuitive and painful: it’s to stay the hell apart.In the longer term, the question is more searching. What can we build, together, to keep each other safe, not just from disease, but from want, from despair, from solitude? These questions, I think, will collapse old party isions. After this brutal lesson in what matters, we will have a keen eye afterwards for what doesn’t. Labour can model that now – given that it just isn’t possible to cooperate and compete simultaneously, it must choose cooperation. Everything else can wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/083c9d5002b89e66f81d380f8683b493e8f63c8d/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fb87c018445f157bee0f6cc2df4e3b","title":"europe views uk coronavirus plan disbelief","story":"Here in Spain, the number of deaths is rising, but I am more worried about my friends and family in Britain and the USYesterday, in the small Spanish country town where I go to fill up my water supply, an ambulance with flashing lights went up the deserted main street. Two municipal police cars followed it slowly, making it look already like a funeral procession. Only three other people were out, and two of them were wearing face masks.When I first saw pictures like this from China and Iran, for some reason, I didn’t take seriously that it would also happen in Spain – my home for the past 25 years. It wasn’t just me who thought this, many politicians and experts were saying the same.How wrong we were. Italy has overtaken China, becoming the country with the greatest number of deaths in the pandemic. Spain took third place from Iran yesterday, and will likely take only three days to move ahead of China. Little surprise, then, that the government has now extended our almost total lockdown to a full month.Ideas of cultural or national superiority are the greatest risk factor of all at a time like this. Nowhere is that a more serious danger right now than in the United Kingdom and the United States – two countries especially prone to such delusions.In fact, watching the UK from a distance has felt like scrambling out of your car at the front of a multiple pile-up on the motorway, only to see other cars smashing into the rear 20 minutes later. Didn’t anyone warn them about what lay ahead? Surely everyone knew. That is what it looks like from mainland Europe – the new centre of the pandemic.If you think that what is happening in southern Europe is a result of corruption, incompetence, lower household income or poor public health systems, then you are fooling yourself. All the signs suggest that the UK and the US are heading in exactly the same direction. Both countries are just a week or so behind.From my remote country house, a long way from my elderly neighbours, I have been viewing the daily briefings by Boris Johnson and his advisers with a mixture of incredulity and occasional admiration. How can they be so sure that their approach of managing and mitigating the flow of the pandemic – hardly used by anyone else – is right?The health experts sound convinced, but Boris Johnson’s air-punching promises about “turning the tide” remind me of King Cnut. There are other recognisable and worrying elements. The UK government’s reaction chimes too easily with Johnson’s “sceptered isle” nationalism and blitz-style nostalgia. It also fits the “wild card” thinking of Dominic Cummings. Donald Trump and his cheerleaders, meanwhile, appear convinced that America’s “greatness” will itself provide a magical coat of protection.Politicians and experts must make hard choices – and they may still be right. I certainly hope so. Yet hubris, in this case, will be paid for in lives.If the rest of the world looks upon the UK’s coronavirus planning with skepticism, that is because it is a clear outlier. A plucky nation boldly going its own way is a perfectly reasonable pitch for Brexit. It does not sound so convincing during a pandemic.Commentators in Spanish newspapers and on the radio are aghast. “They are putting us all in danger,” warned a group of Spanish scientists in eldiario.es. French ministers were talking about a special ban on people from the UK.The British “herd immunity” model (which the government has since pivoted on) was certainly not embraced by countries in Asia, which have been spectacularly successful at stopping the virus so far. They must be looking at Europe and the US with utter bewilderment.Trump calls this a “Chinese” pandemic, but it will probably take more lives in both the US and the UK than in China itself. Yet these two higher income countries, with much smaller populations, had many more months to prepare.Spain failed to implement early widespread testing (and is only just starting), but at least we are 10 days into our month-long lockdown. That terrifying daily leap of a third in the number of deaths will have begun to flatten out before that period ends. The UK, however, has already had more deaths than when Spain (or China) went into quarantine – and it still has not fully locked itself down.Recently, my neighbours in Madrid called me to tell of police vans patrolling the streets, loudspeakers blaring, reminding people to stay indoors. For all the madrileño capacity for resistance (and a three-year siege during the Spanish civil war surely matches the blitz spirit), it is grim. So, too, was that ambulance going up the street.And yet I find myself more worried for family and friends in the UK and the US than for those of us here in Spain. You are just behind us. You, too, may soon overtake Iran and China. When this is all over, we will count the dead and discover which governments did the best job of protecting their people. Ideas of national superiority will have to be buried with them.• Giles Tremlett is a journalist and author based in Madrid"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc80a84ae59de3dd7b2ab6f1a29625ae3a4e9e59/0_322_5433_3261/master/5433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2e03ed9aafa89f2aa23bf074fdea6a7","title":"icu doctors tough decisions coronavirus uk","story":"The scale of coronavirus in the UK means we need a clear framework on who should be treatedThe most certain feature of a pandemic is uncertainty. For NHS health workers, this is all around us. Many doctors are now being “side-skilled” (a new term) so they can help provide intensive care to patients. It’s important that the public understand what intensive care units (ICU) are, as this will make clear what faces us in the coming weeks and months.In all major hospitals, the ICU is for patients with an illness that immediately threatens their survival. Treatment is provided with machines and drugs that take over the roles of their organs, while sedation suspends the patient and allows their body to recover. These kinds of treatment cannot happen on normal wards. Skilled care is provided by an army of nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists and dietitians. ICU doctors work together with radiologists, microbiologists, surgeons, cardiologists, physicians and pathologists.This level of intensity is normal for ICUs, but Covid-19 isn’t. Coronavirus patients needing ICU will be among the sickest – almost all will need breathing support, or what’s known as “level 3” care. On top of this, precautions to prevent infection among staff and other patients will increase work intensity even further.To meet the increased demand of coronavirus patients, the capacity of ICUs need to be scaled up. But what does this mean? Some commentators have suggested that the capacity of ICU wards will need to increase sevenfold. In every NHS hospital, normal activity is being erted towards this end – but it requires planning on four major fronts: space, staff, stuff and standards.The space required in ICUs is enormous: it includes side rooms for safe care, facilities such as oxygen, air, suction, IT and lab support and storage space. Staff who are trained are scarce, and many will be absent due to illness or isolation during the epidemic. Stuff is the hardware and disposables that are needed in abundance, and are currently procured through fragile supply chains. Standards are the complex working practices required to provide the best quality care we can deliver.In larger hospitals many patients undergoing complex surgery are subsequently admitted to ICU for treatment and monitoring. If this routine surgery requiring ICU can be paused, the four key needs of ICU capacity may be rapidly available. Beyond that, it becomes challenging. In smaller hospitals, where almost ICU admissions are on an emergency basis, demand just can’t be put on hold during a crisis.One solution is to take over hospital operating theatres. ICU medical staff may need to be supplemented by anaesthetists, all of whom will have ICU experience, and nurses by theatre staff, not all of whom will. Staff will need to work differently. In ICU it’s normal for one nurse to care for one patient. In the heat of the crisis this may need to change: one ICU trained nurse, supported by those with different training, could care for several.No healthcare system can be prepared for a crisis of this magnitude and speed. Staff across the country are taking extraordinary actions to create space and service. Hospitals are building their defences as best they can, but we do not yet know how high and hard the wave will hit.In normal times, ICU treatment saves many lives, but it is not a quick fix – and it may not be right for all patients. At their sickest, ICU patients will be sedated and their bodily functions performed for them as they recover, they must repossess those faculties. Treatment in an ICU itself often leads to further frailty or new illnesses as the body lies ill, it ages. Survival may be impossible, or it may be accompanied by a slow and incomplete recovery that can take months or even years.A central tenet of medical care is that it should benefit the patient and be consistent with what they would want. Too often, discussions about risks to the patient’s life, the burden of treatment and the quality of life that follows, are not considered until the patient is too ill to be involved. Doctors and family must then work together to balance risks against benefits and act in the patient’s best interests.The ethical framework of medical care is centred on doing good, avoiding harm, being fair and ensuring patients are enabled to make their own decision. These principles guide every decision to admit or not to admit patients to ICU. The magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic will involve making decisions that, in normal times, doctors aren’t confronted with: decisions about which patients to treat in ICU when not all can be.In Italy, doctors have been forced to make these choices. This kind of decision-making, known as triage, is a practice borrowed from the battlefield, when doctors had to make decisions about where to focus their stretched resources. Some have stated that “doctors make these decisions all the time”. I disagree. Every day, doctors wrestle with decisions about what is right for the patient in front of them. But when resource-based triage occurs, the decisions become about what is in the “greater good” and “doing the best for the most”.This is a fundamental change. Where normally the doctors’ focus is solely on what is in the best interests of an inidual, when resources are overwhelmed and not all patients can be fully treated, doctors may instead have to focus on what is in the best interests of society. In normal circumstances, the General Medical Council state that doctors must avoid such decisions. If this comes to pass in the UK, doctors will be making some of the hardest decision we have ever had to make.But we can’t do this alone. If it becomes necessary, a framework to inform these decisions should be shared with the rest of society. In this urgent crisis we need a public discussion to help guide these difficult decisions, and clear advice from our medical, philosophical and political leaders.In the meantime the government and NHS are making unprecedented efforts to prepare the health service for the pandemic. The public can help reduce peak demand on the NHS by following the government’s social distancing and self-isolation advice. Heeding this guidance will reduce the risk of infection for you and others. It will create space in ICUs and may even save someone’s life.• Tim Cook is a doctor in an NHS intensive care unit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bba0ca37ad6f0b51fe0d7d9f77932c38b9b9e04e/0_0_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a127d37937e6dc97f7d4ec44cf99772","title":"your coronavirus sabbatical starts now dont let it go to waste","story":"Stuck at home? Here’s how you can use quarantine to redesign your lifeAll over the world those who care about their health are hunkering down at home. In other circumstances, this might be a boon, an unexpected opportunity to chill-out rather than set off for yet another day in the frantically-paced 21st century. But when you are looking at weeks, maybe months of this, you do start to ask: how on earth am I going to fill my time? I have a few ideas …Start by thinking of the range of things you would like to do: from tidying out the junk drawer in your kitchen to repainting your dining chairs to reading À la Recherche du Temps Perdu or starting to write your own novel. Put each idea on a spreadsheet, scoring them 1 to 5 by such factors as practicality, seriousness of intent, length of time needed, possibility of completing the task alone and so on. You might have 30 possible projects but once you’ve put them through your filter, about five would be a good total. Goals should be achievable, maybe not easily, but you don’t want to set out for something so gargantuan that failure is inevitable.For while it’s good to come up with self-improving ideas for your coronavirus sabbatical, you need to keep in mind self-compassion too. Don’t beat yourself up over this. It’s not a competition. This is a difficult time for everyone don’t make it any harder.If you are continuing to do your job from home, be up and showered at your usual time don’t stay in pyjamas or work from bed. You want to stay sharp and focused. If your time is your own, you have more flexibility, but most people find that they get much more done if they set themselves a timetable with breaks every 45 minutes or so. It’s also a good idea to shuffle your tasks. After all, you have plenty of time, so you don’t have to finish everything before starting something new..Some projects could entail working with others remotely. Learning a language for example. A friend or tutor might agree to have language lessons with you by phone. You could move your book group online, or you could start a new, smaller one with the specific aim of reading positive, encouraging texts no more Handmaid’s Tale for you.You might even come up with a new business idea. One friend of mine Suzanne Noble has a hit with her Corona Concerts on Facebook, which she started when her London gigs as a blues singer were cancelled.Staying in contact with others is key. As therapist Mark Bailey wrote on welldoing.org, “We are social beings and we need interaction to be psychologically healthy. Facetime and Skype are frankly godsends in these times so use them – not just for work but for friends, acquaintances and family. Focus conversation on other things in life, not just coronavirus!”If you are able to get out of your home and safely go for a walk or run, do just that. But, increasingly, that’s not encouraged. Use YouTube videos for exercise tips or yoga classes haul out your skipping rope, run up your stairs. If you’ve got a standing desk, use that for some of the time.If you can’t move about much, don’t spend too much time in your kitchen or you risk something less dangerous than coronavirus, but unpalatable all the same: packing on the pounds. Drinking lots of alcohol may also seem like a good idea at the outset, but it will soon have the same effect as the food.All the irritating things in your life? Your messy desktop, unfiled documents, ancient bank statements, photos, schoolbooks: this is the time to deep clean your administrative life. Be brutal, go for the clean slate.Your wardrobe too would probably benefit from the sort of critical analysis that large tranches of free time will afford. Follow the time-honoured advice of separate piles: throw out, recycle or charity, mend or clean, keep and wear.Spend some of your time creatively. What better time to get Harriet Griffey’s Write Every Day to kickstart creative writing? Or dare yourself to draw, even if you haven’t since you were 12. Or sew, or knit? Or write poetry?Your might also imagine that this almost unbelievable health crisis is the beginning of something new.

How do you even start to educate them yourself? Here are expert tips from teachersSchool may have closed for the foreseeable future, and all exams cancelled, but children still need to be educated and entertained – as well as reassured. Many schools plan to send work home and there are lots of free resources available via online platforms such as BBC Teach. But meanwhile, how do you even start home learning when this is all so new? We asked teachers for their emergency advice.“Great learning only happens when children feel happy, safe and secure. Provide your children with reassurance and love.” Jules White, headteacher at Tanbridge House school, Horsham“Children need normality, familiarity and structure. So keep to a routine. It makes home schooling easier and helps children to realise this is not a holiday, and that teachers are expecting learning to take place to some degree.” Lillie Rosenblatt, teacher at Brookfield primary school in Camden, London“Let your child create their own structure or timetable for the day, combining their ideas and home learning. If they try and schedule double PlayStation every morning, then it’s probably time for parents to step in, but give them the option first. I think a lot of parents will be impressed with the outcome.” Joanna Conway, headteacher, Whitegate End primary school and nursery, Oldham“In communities like mine, there are not a lot of PCs, laptops and other tech in the home that allow pupils to access learning platforms. My advice is let your kids have a holiday and enjoy themselves until they get bored. Then they will want to get on to learning they have been set. The homework is there not to improve standards but to ease boredom.” Chris Dyson, headteacher, Parklands primary school, Leeds“It will be important for friends to stay in virtual contact with each other as long as interactions are friendly and supportive – but avoid an unhealthy overreliance on screen time in all of its guises. Too much screen time has very negative effects on physical and mental health and it disrupts sleep patterns as well. Variety is key: exercise, reading a great book and learning a new skill are all suitable ways of avoiding the sheer monotony of a TV and computer screen.” Jules White“Continue to practise essential English and maths. Review fundamental maths skills such as number bonds, times tables, ision facts and additionsubtraction strategies. Encourage your child to write for pleasure about what they’ve done that day, or make a comic.” Jordan Bickel, Grand Avenue primary and nursery school, Surbiton“Children need to have a plan or timetable right from the start, and to stick to it using a timer. But activities should not just be solely English and maths-based. Making learning fun is vital – so baking, painting and getting out and about in the garden are essential to reduce boredom.” Emily Proffitt, headteacher, Tittensor first school, Stoke-on-Trent“Listen to your child. Enjoy hearing your child explain what they are being asked to do, and the challenges they face.” Jules White“It’s vital that children get downtime to be independent and relax. We are encouraging our pupils to write to each other, giving them a purpose but also helping them feel less isolated.” Emily Proffitt“Whether it’s reading to themselves, a parent, a sibling or even a special animal friend, it’s essential children continue to read. Reading anything counts.” Jordan Bickel “The younger the child, the less time they can sit and learn for, so frequent breaks are important for productivity.” Lillie Rosenblatt“I’d recommend around two hours’ learning in total a day for children in key stage 1, which covers reception to year 2. That should include arts and crafts, and hands-on activities. Children in key stage 2, which covers year 3 through to year 6, would be able to do more: about three to four hours. But again, that should include PE activities and more creative tasks as well.” Jordan Bickel“Encourage your child to research something that is of interest to them and show their learning with a creative project. This could be making something with play-dough, junk modelling, papier-mache or a presentation. Let your children experiment.” Jordan BickelMovement breaks – such as dancing to music, performing animal walks or playing Simon Says – provide children with sensory feedback and offer them a chance to “reset”. “If fast movement breaks aren’t working, slow it down by doing wall or chair push-ups or squeezing hands, shoulders or legs. Find what works for your child. It will really help with learning and focus.” Lillie Rosenblatt“There are so many benefits to outdoor learning: children develop an appreciation of the world around them, enhance their solving skills and increase their sensory skills, not forgetting the benefits for physical and mental health. Maybe you could learn about all the plants and trees near your house, or create your own outdoor circuit and do a daily workout together. Doing something physical keeps our mind healthy too.” Joanna Conway“Positive constructive praise that targets effort, behaviour and specific aspects of a child’s work is much more powerful than just saying ‘well done for completing your English’. Lillie Rosenblatt“Enjoy the extra time together. Create some artwork, a board game, make a meal together, do a jigsaw, write a song or put on a production, a dance or make a video. Maybe you could send it to relatives to cheer them up. I would also recommend sharing a ‘family gratitude’ each day.” Joanna Conway“Try to keep to your timetable as much as you can. It will really help you to vary what you study at home and your teachers are more likely to be online at those points in the day to help you specifically.” Niamh Sweeney, teacher, Long Road sixth-form college, Cambridge“Search the web for free resources for your subject. There are numerous websites now offering premium content for free during the crisis.” Alex Goldsmith, maths teacher, the Alleyne’s academy, Stevenage“Keep a journal. Each day, spend six minutes writing about the following: three things you are grateful for, how you plan to make today great, a good deed you will do that day, how you plan to improve yourself and, at the end of it, some great things you experienced that day.” Chris Hirst, Stretford high school, Manchester“Try not to worry about the situation. As soon as schools and colleges know what is happening about college and university applications, we will let you know. Take a break from social media – and don’t forget to wash your hands.” Niamh Sweeney“Read a book you haven’t read before. Take a photography challenge: document your time in isolation in photographs (your mood, what you did, how you felt). Calculate the value of Pi to as many decimal points as you can. Learn a dance step or a magic trick from the internet. Make a meal from whatever you have in the cupboards – extra marks for putting together a totally original, mad or weird recipe. Go online to kids.guinnessworldrecords and find a World Record that you can try to break at home.

Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”Monks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.The World Health Organization describes NO2 as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.NO2 levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hotspots.The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hotspots such as Marylebone in London.“What I think will come out of this is a realisation - because we are forced to - that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8af7e931cea74c653928d7d656b13a798c0a589/0_53_5750_3452/master/5750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab355c1c9cc9e2d03b74917a5df6d187","title":"electric cars produce less co2 than petrol vehicles study confirms","story":"Finding will come as boost to governments seeking to move to net zero carbon emissionsElectric vehicles produce less carbon dioxide than petrol cars across the vast majority of the globe – contrary to the claims of some detractors, who have alleged that the CO2 emitted in the production of electricity and their manufacture outweighs the benefits.The finding is a boost to governments, including the UK, seeking to move to net zero carbon emissions, which will require a massive expansion of the electric car fleet. A similar benefit was found for electric heat pumps.In the UK, transport is now the biggest contributor to the climate crisis and domestic heating has been stubbornly stuck on natural gas for much of the country.Across the world, passenger road vehicles and household heating generate about a quarter of all emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. That makes electric vehicles essential to reducing overall emissions, but how clean an electric vehicle is also depends on how the electricity is generated, the efficiency of the supply and the efficiency of the vehicle.That has made some iniduals and governments question whether these technologies are worth expanding. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, produced a decisive yes.Scientists from the universities of Exeter, Nijmegen and Cambridge conducted lifecycle assessments that showed that even where electricity generation still involves substantial amounts of fossil fuel, there was a CO2 saving over conventional cars and fossil fuel heating.Heat pumps use electricity and heat exchange systems – similar in principle to those found in fridges – to take advantage of the difference in temperature underground and at the surface, in the case of ground source heat pumps, and between the outdoor air and indoors in the case of air source heat pumps. If they were widely used, the study found, they could reduce global carbon emissions by up to 0.8 gigatons a year by 2050, or the equivalent of Germany’s emissions today.“The idea that electric vehicles or heat pumps could increase emissions is essentially a myth,” said Florian Knobloch of Nijmegen University in the Netherlands, the lead author of the study. “We’ve seen a lot of disinformation going around. Here is a definitive study that can dispel those myths.”Jean-Francois Mercure, of Exeter University, a co-author of the study, added: “The answer is clear: to reduce carbon emissions, we should choose electric cars and household heat pumps over fossil fuel alternatives.”Among the detractors has been Bjørn Lomborg, the climate controversialist, who argued in a column published in newspapers around the world last week that electric cars were “simply expensive gadgets heavily subsidised for the wealthy to feel good while doing very little for the planet”.Mike Childs, head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “Electric vehicles and heat pumps are absolutely critical for meeting climate goals so it’s good to see this favourable report. In the UK, both technologies will continue to make big carbon savings alongside our switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy to power the electricity grid.”But he warned that insulating homes and improving public transport remained important goals, alongside electric vehicles and heat pumps, and called for much more government action to realise the benefits.“Where the UK is dragging its feet is supporting the necessary rapid rollout of electric cars and heat pumps as well as the infrastructure to support them,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45d596640e52d1550f6bbcdef921663d9e352a2/0_548_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc44b13a3e27ddcfe3e70d0d0af8192","title":"meat prices could rise as covid 19 adds pressure to vulnerable supply chain coronavirus","story":"Possible slaughterhouse shutdowns and staffing issues put pressure on ‘vulnerable’ supply chains, as campaigners call for restriction of live exportsCampaigners have called for the suspension of all live animal shipments out of Europe, and a restriction to the shortest possible journeys within Europe, over welfare and animal diseases concerns – as meat supply chains face potentially debilitating strain. Last week queues of up to 60km (37 miles) formed at the PolishGerman border on Wednesday after Poland announced that it was shutting to foreigners. Although the closure was supposed to apply solely to people, cargo experienced a knock-on effect, with some trucks reportedly taking as long as 18 hours to get through border controls. More queues formed at the BulgarianTurkish border. Sabine Fisher of German animal welfare group Animal Angels said: “One driver told us that it had taken him three hours to travel 300 metres. There were trucks of sheep, bulls, cows. I’ve never seen a queue like it.”Under EU regulations no animal should travel for more than eight hours without being rested. Campaigners have now sent a letter to the EU commission calling for the immediate suspension of live animal transport to non-EU countries, and of all journeys over eight hours within the EU, as such journeys also raise concerns over disease transmission.“Farm animals are either a source or messenger of zoonotic diseases,” said Gabriel Paun of Animals International “Suspending live export and trading meat instead will ensure both food security and public health. With the current border crisis, the EU commission breaks its own transport regulations by deliberately putting animals through planned and unnecessary suffering. On top of that they expose all the animal handlers, truck drivers and others to risk.”The border crisis has added to growing anxiety about the meat supply chain. Any shutdown of slaughterhouses could lead to supply restrictions, price rises and problems for farmers, say experts.“The slaughterhouse system is extremely vulnerable because although there is an increasing amount of automation, they are still largely dependent on human labour,” said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst with IHS Markit’s Agribusiness Intelligence. “If someone is ill on the line, then does the whole line have to self-isolate and for how long? The plant will have to be shut down and deep cleaned. And then if there are not enough inspectors, or if staff just don’t come in, they will also have to shut down.”If there are no vets or inspectors available, the plant cannot operate. And the stringent hygiene requirements mean that a shortage of gloves and other sanitation equipment of the type currently needed by medical staff could mean shutdown.Slaughterhouses are acknowledged to be the vulnerable point in the meat supply chain. A huge amount of consolidation in the last few decades means that both the US and EU have fewer, larger meat processing plants. In the US, according to the Animal Welfare Institute, the number of slaughterhouses fell from nearly 8,000 in 1970 to just under 3,000 in 2018. And in the UK, according to the Sustainable Food Trust, the number of red meat abattoirs has fallen from about 1,900 in 1971 to 249 in 2018.When a single US Tyson beef plant was shut down by a fire last summer, it caused a market shock that some called “historically significant”. The margins for beef carcasses doubled, while prices for live cattle fell. This is because shutdowns mean farmers may not be able to take their cattle to slaughter, and will then face unexpected costs in feed and care.On top of this the meat processing industry has long struggled to attract workers. “Finding workers for slaughterhouses has been a global problem,” said Rupert Claxton of international food consultancy Gira. “But we’ve got a particular problem now because if you are earning £13 an hour, are you going to be coming into work if you’re at risk? And these workers are not immediately replaceable you need a week’s training, shadowing someone else on the line.”There were reports early in the week that Danish Crown, one of Europe’s largest pork producers, had been concerned about the possible closure of one of its plants. However, a spokesperson explained that although many of the workers at the Danish plant commute regularly from Poland, they are confident production will continue at normal levels.Karsten Maier of the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union said that it was hard to have a complete overview of the situation at present, but that they were closely monitoring events.In the UK, David Lindars of the British Meat Processors Association told the : “We have been in regular contact with the Food Standards Authority, and have come up with a robust plan and very strong contingency plans for the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30aad3e606fea239f01b3b72d6a5d548bbba3a3/0_0_4977_3184/master/4977.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=51e6c3bdd1604be46f2b55194fc20fc2 1320w","title":"pretty woman 30 conservatism materialism glowing star power","story":"Garry Marshall’s hit romantic comedy might have some questionable sexual politics but Julia Roberts remains a magnetic breakoutThere are a lot of fantasies at play in Pretty Woman, the hit romantic comedy that transformed Julia Roberts into one of the biggest stars in Hollywood virtually overnight 30 years ago. It’s a fantasy about a humble Georgia girl getting her fairytale ending. It’s a fantasy about upward mobility on the streets and salons of Beverly Hills. It’s a fantasy about turning Roberts herself into a modern-day Audrey Hepburn, prim and elegant and absolutely certain to know which type of fork is appropriate for each course. (Count the tines.)But the most unlikely fantasy of all is Roberts playing a Hollywood Boulevard streetwalker who really isn’t that kind of gal. Roberts plays Vivian Ward, an 11th-grade dropout who lives in a flophouse with Kit (Laura San Giacomo), her irreverent best friend and prostitution guru. The film makes it clear that she’s new to sex trade, that she doesn’t do drugs, that she doesn’t have a pimp and that she enjoys complete agency over the questions of “who”, “when” and “how much”. Late in the film, after Vivian has spent a week at the Beverly Wilshire with a rich client, Kit tells her: “You sure don’t fit in on the Boulevard lookin’ like you do. Not that you ever did.”Like all the classic Old Hollywood romantic comedies, Pretty Woman is about a man and a woman who are locked into a flirty but contentious struggle to get on equal footing, with the woman usually at a disadvantage. Director Garry Marshall makes vintage entertainment an obsession for Vivian, who guffaws infectiously at old I Love Lucy episodes and falls asleep watching Hepburn and Cary Grant in Charade. Marshall and his screenwriter, JF Lawton, are preoccupied by turning Vivian into a picture of innocence – not a sex worker who hits the lottery, but a naif who discovers the proper lady she always was.And it’s not like master-of-the-universe Edward Lewis was out looking for a call girl, either, even though he’s played by Richard Gere, who had a star-making turn himself as a gorgeous, narcissistic sex worker in American Gigolo. Edward is just an out-of-towner looking for directions, so his intentions are pure, too. So Vivian and Edward’s partnership starts with a more traditional romcom meet-cute and chemistry takes over from there. The two bond over their transactional natures: as someone who buys and butchers distressed companies for a living, Edward appreciates Vivian’s talent for hard-nosed negotiation. She gouges him for directions and gouges him again with rates for her hourly, overnight and weekly services.Edward’s transactional nature so defines his life that he’s nearly incapable of taking pleasure in it. He was an only child who hated his father so much that crushing his business was an early priority. Vivian gives him the uncomplicated companionship he needs to get through a tough week of acquisition talks in Los Angeles — he seems pleased with himself to have discovered someone like her, who doesn’t seem to need him like his ex-wife or the girlfriend currently moving out of his apartment. He wants the best: the penthouse suite, the best booth at the opera, the escargot at a fancy restaurant. Pretty Woman is about getting him to care about something that doesn’t involve him reaching into his wallet.But really, money is everything in Pretty Woman. The film may have come out in early 1990, but for anthropological purposes, it’s as 1980s as Donkey Kong, Bananarama and the Rubik’s Cube. The first utterances of the script reference a savings and loan officer, and Edward picks up Vivian in a 1989 silver Lotus Esprit that he can’t drive. The most famous sequences of the film are Vivian shopping on Rodeo Drive with Edward’s cash and credit card, the camera ogling brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and BMW. Aside from Edward’s sleazy lawyer Phillip (Jason Alexander), the biggest villains here are the shopkeepers who get one look at Vivian in her Hollywood Boulevard get-up and say, “I don’t think we have anything for you.”Vivian’s rejection at this salon paves the way for a sweet comeuppance later on, when she takes her business elsewhere, but the film secretly sides with the snobs. It implies that she really isn’t a good enough person to deserve high-end service, so it’s up to the hotel manager, played by Marshall favorite Héctor Elizondo, to give her lessons in refinement. Pretty Woman wants the audience to see Elizondo as the ultimate gentleman – and the actor is charming enough to oblige – but in actuality, it’s an embarrassment to have her at his hotel. That she turns out to be a prize pupil surprises him, but he’s the gatekeeper to Edward’s world and she needs to learn how to be rich.And yet for all its risible qualities, including a third-act sexual assault attempt, star power takes it much further than it has any right to go. Roberts makes a glamorous Cinderella, but she’s also blessedly unpretentious, given to little bursts of laughter and salty language even after she’s been through charm school. The bit where Edward surprises Vivian by snapping a necklace case on her fingers is an all-time movie moment for a reason: Roberts looks impossibly elegant in the shoulder-less red dress and white satin gloves, but she can’t suppress the yelping laugh that connects her to common folk. Gere’s tendency to underact, occasionally to the point to somnambulism, makes him the perfect counterpoint to the VistaVision bigness of Roberts’ charm, like a diamond that only pops when it’s offset by a much simpler setting.There’s every reason to resist the gross materialism and conservative sexual politics of Pretty Woman, but Roberts makes Vivian’s ascendence to the upper crust a victory for the little guy. Being happy for her is as easy as being happy for a friend who hit the lottery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f25e6b7cee48c90bc1eb998f85d11f0fe539598/0_30_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf88312b79c01f81d8cac3fe6b32f4c0","title":"the jesus rolls review the big lebowski john turturro","story":"Turturro’s return to the role of the bowling champ he played in the Coen brothers’ cherished classic is an amiably indifferent caperJohn Turturro’s planned return to the universe of The Big Lebowski was announced four years ago with a fanfare as a much-anticipated spin-off from one of cinema’s most cherished cult items. With its belated theatrical release nixed by the coronavirus, The Jesus Rolls has now snuck out on streaming platforms. It appears key creative personnel lost faith or patience along the way: these choppy 85 minutes comprise a sunnily indifferent caper, displaying next to none of the Coens’ visual invention, and little of their wit. At best, what you get is an amiable footnote.Turturro follows the road taken by Bertrand Blier in 1974’s bad-taste classic Les Valseuses (AKA Going Places), replaying pivotal couplings and conversations, albeit with a sensibility too goofy to push as far or as forcefully as Blier. Released from Sing Sing, bowling baller Jesus Quintana is met by old pal Pete (Bobby Cannavale), and the pair bounce around the fringes of New York state, picking up braless nympho (Audrey Tautou, helpless in the face of a 1974-era characterisation) and encountering endless cameoing celebs: Jon Hamm as an arsey coiffeur, Pete Davidson as somebody’s unclaimed son, Susan Sarandon smartly cast in the Jeanne Moreau role as a soured drifter seeking one final fling. Mostly, though, everyone is driving around looking for the one compelling reason for the film to exist.Unfortunately, nobody found it, though there are funny moments early on: Jesus wondering whether an endocrinologist might help with buckshot testes, and going toe-to-toe with security guard Michael Badalucco. Choppiness is the real issue. There are baffling shunts from town to country, while the middle stretch tosses up scenes with no real function or punchline.The Coens’ original was not un-haphazard – it needed a rug to tie itself together – but it troubled to work up its protagonist’s zen-like chill into an adoptable creed. Here, the same laissez-faire stance starts to look like a liability, an excuse for turning in a shrug of a film. Will this do? Lebowski cultists will have strong opinions.•The Jesus Rolls is available on digital platforms including iTunes and Google Play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93b65a7e12b1bd71f32a8302a7d419a277c438d/0_52_2906_1744/master/2906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab708ad6aae7701b17ef46b0cb98fcf8","title":"woody allen memoir published in us apropos of nothing","story":"The controversial film director’s autobiography Apropos of Nothing had been dropped by its original publisher Woody Allen’s memoir, dropped by its original publisher after widespread criticism, has found a new home.The 400-page book, still called Apropos of Nothing, was released on Monday by Arcade Publishing.“The book is a candid and comprehensive personal account by Woody Allen of his life,” Arcade announced, “ranging from his childhood in Brooklyn through his acclaimed career in film, theatre, television, print and standup comedy, as well as exploring his relationships with family and friends.”With little advance notice, the 84-year-old film-maker’s book arrives at a time when much of the world is preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic. Arcade is an imprint of Skyhorse Publishing and a Skyhorse spokeswoman said no decisions had been made on whether Allen would give interviews. Financial details for his deal with Arcade were not released and the spokeswoman had no immediate comment on whether the book would come out in Europe, where publishers in several countries have expressed interest.Apropos of Nothing begins in the wry tone of such literary heroes as JD Salinger and George S Kaufman, describing Allen’s New York City upbringing and love affairs with Diane Keaton and others with a sense of nostalgia and angst that mirrors Allen movies ranging from Radio Days and The Purple Rose of Cairo to Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. But it darkens and becomes defensive as he recalls his relationship with Mia Farrow and the allegations he abused daughter Dylan Farrow, which for many have come to define his public image in recent years.Allen was with Farrow for more than a decade, and recalls happy times with the “very, very beautiful” actress that would cool over the years, especially after the 1987 birth of their biological child, Ronan (named Satchel at birth). As he has alleged before, he and Farrow were essentially apart by the time he began dating her daughter Soon-Yi Previn, who is more than 30 years younger than him, in the early 90s. “At the very early stages of our new relationship, when lust reigns supreme ... we couldn’t keep our hands off each other,” he writes of Previn, whom he married in 1997 and to whom he dedicates the book.Recalling the day Farrow learned of the affair, after discovering erotic photographs of her twentysomething daughter at Allen’s apartment, Allen writes: “Of course I understand her shock, her dismay, her rage, everything. It was the correct reaction.” But he expresses no regret over him and Previn becoming lovers.“Sometimes, when the going got rough and I was maligned everywhere, I was asked if I had known the outcome, do I ever wish I never took up with Soon-Yi?” he writes. “I always answered I’d do it again in a heartbeat.”Allen has long denied sexually abusing Dylan. “I never laid a finger on Dylan, never did anything to her that could be even misconstrued as abusing her it was a total fabrication from start to finish,” he writes. Describing a visit to Farrow’s Connecticut house in August 1992, when he allegedly molested Dylan, he acknowledges briefly placing his head on his seven-year-old daughter’s lap, but adds: “I certainly didn’t do anything improper to her. I was in a room full of people watching TV mid-afternoon.”Allen was not charged, after two separate investigations in the 90s. Dylan has maintained that she was abused and her allegations have been embraced in the #MeToo era. Ellen Page and Greta Gerwig are among the actors who have said that they won’t work with Allen again and his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York, didn’t come out in the US. (Amazon, which was to release that and three other Allen movies, ended its deal with him Allen sued and an out-of-court settlement was reportedly reached). Numerous publishers are said to have shied away from his memoir when an Allen representative shopped it last year.“I can’t deny that it plays into my poetic fantasies to be an artist whose work isn’t seen in his own country and is forced, because of injustice, to have his public abroad,” Allen writes. “Henry Miller comes to mind. DH Lawrence. James Joyce. I see myself standing amongst them defiantly. It’s about at that point my wife wakes me up and says, ‘You’re snoring.’”While Allen writes at length about his breakup with Farrow, he remembers warmly their films together, among them Hannah and Her Sisters and Broadway Danny Rose, and calls her an actress of versatility and depth. He also praises longtime defenders such as Dick Cavett and Alec Baldwin and shares fond memories of Mel Brooks, Bette Midler and Neil Simon, among others.The initial announcement of Apropos of Nothing came earlier this month, when Grand Central Publishing confirmed to the Associated Press that it would release Allen’s book on 7 April. But the news was met with growing outrage, centred on allegations of Allen’s abuse of his daughter. Ronan Farrow, who shared the Pulitzer prize with the New York Times for his New Yorker investigation into Harvey Weinstein, was enraged to learn that Allen’s book was being published by the same parent company, Hachette Book Group that released his Catch and Kill. Dozens of Hachette employees staged a walkout over the book and Farrow, who had been working on Catch and Kill at the time Hachette acquired Allen’s memoir, said he would stop working with the publisher.Hachette cancelled the release less than a week later. Stephen King was among those questioning the decision, writing on Twitter: “It’s who gets muzzled next that worries me.”In a postscript to the Arcade edition, Allen alleges that Hachette had vowed to publish Apropos of Nothing despite his “being a toxic pariah and menace to society”. But, he writes, “When actual flak did arrive they thoughtfully reassessed their position” and “dumped the book like it was a hunk of Xenon 135.”  has contacted Hachette for a response.Arcade editor Jeannette Seaver said in a statement: “In this strange time, when truth is too often dismissed as ‘fake news,’ we as publishers prefer to give voice to a respected artist, rather than bow to those determined to silence him.”Skyhorse is a prolific and sometimes provocative company with a catalogue of books by everyone from Samuel Beckett and Octavio Paz to JFK conspiracy theorist Jim Garrison and Alan Dershowitz, the attorney and defender of Donald Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0deac0287f2ac38d8e170a90a1d1c5e0fbaa1641/0_204_4131_2478/master/4131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91910ab44ad028a3555be1f75d397d46","title":"observer food monthly 20 best noodle recipes","story":"The wonder of the world’s favourite food from our recipe hoard to yoursNoodles: the perfect lunch or dinner via Italy, Spain and China.

Its flavour is strong, so a little goes a long way, but it adds a beautiful fragrance to dishes like this seasonal twist on chicken kiev.Larger chicken pieces will be less fiddly than smaller ones.25g wild garlic leaves150g softened unsalted butterZest of ½ lemon1 garlic clove, finely crushed with saltSalt and black pepper2 eggs, beaten70g plain flour, seasoned150g dried breadcrumbs from an old loaf or panko crumbs4 large chicken breastsVegetable oil, to fryHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4. Finely chop the wild garlic and put it in a bowl with the butter and lemon zest. Add the garlic, mash everything together with a fork and then season to taste. Lay out a piece of clingfilm, shape the butter into a sausage shape in the middle, wrap tightly and refrigerate for least 30 minutes to harden.Once the butter is firm, pour the beaten eggs on to a deep plate, then pour the flour and the breadcrumbs on to two others. Put the chicken breasts on to a board flat side down, stick a sharp knife into the fat end and slice open a small pocket be careful not to slice all the way through. Cut the butter into eight slices and stuff a couple of slices of butter into each pocket, squeezing the edges together to re-seal. Dip each of the breasts into the flour, shake off the excess, then turn in the egg and then the breadcrumbs.Pour 1cm vegetable oil into a large frying pan and put on a medium heat. When it’s hot enough to make a breadcrumb sizzle, cook the chicken for two to three minutes a side until golden and crisp, probably in two batches so as not to crowd the pan. Transfer to a baking dish or tray and bake for a final 15 minutes to finish cooking. Rest for five minutes, then serve with new potatoes and a green salad.Use leftover wild garlic to add character and depth of flavour to omelettes, potato frittatas and simple, thick Vichyssoise-style soups.

No area of society is able to stay immune from this crippling disease. There will be casualties in every sphere of life. Football is no different. Women’s football is no different.Amanda Vandervort, the chief women’s football officer for Fifpro, the global players’ union, said the coronavirus pandemic could be “a major setback to the growth and progress we’ve made as an industry” and called for a “smart and collaborative approach, a common vision that unites national strategies and implements regulatory interventions to ensure we minimise setbacks.”Having spoken to sources at Women’s Super League and Championship clubs, a picture has emerged of the challenges clubs, players and the FA face in trying to mitigate an inescapable crisis.Women’s teams in England operate overwhelmingly at a loss with, generally, parent clubs of varying financial strengths footing the bill. With clubs across the men’s pyramid facing the financial consequences of postponed games, it is inevitable women’s teams will, apart from those associated with the biggest Premier League clubs, be impacted.For the majority of women’s teams, turnstile and other matchday income does not cover the cost of ground contracts or hire, staffing and travel. The broadcast rights for the women’s game are owned by BT Sport and the BBC, who cover their costs rather than paying for rights. This means postponements are significantly less impactful on women’s teams. The biggest losses will be felt through covering player, coaching and staff contracts through an extended season and a potential loss of sponsors.They face the same questions as the men’s game. Who wins the league? Who gets a Champions League place? Who gets relegated? Who comes up? Except the financial implications of those decisions, or that of a voided season, are insignificant by comparison.That puts pressure on the FA to maintain a united stance on the resumption, or not, across professional football the Premier League, EFL, Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship. There is a logic to a united position: split things up and they could be accused of mixed messages at a time when clarity in society is sought after.However, the huge sums of money involved in the men’s game and the consequences of season cancellations or premature conclusions are very different to the problems faced in the women’s. And, even with the best will in the world, it is impossible to not see the teams who have the most to lose or gain, those in the Premier League, dominating decisions.There is widespread sympathy towards the situation the FA is having to deal with. It does appear that support for women’s teams may be on the cards, with clubs being asked to submit their expected losses and costs to the governing body.An FA spokesperson said: “These are unprecedented and challenging times for all industries around the world and football is no different. We continue to work tirelessly with the football community, across every level of the game, to assess the impact of coronavirus, while taking the important steps to support the welfare of clubs, players, staff and supporters.”The lack of a definitive decision on the season is stopping clubs from being able to plan for the future and provide answers to players and staff. On the other hand though, one source voiced concern that the outbreak could be a perfect storm for some clubs that would see it as an excuse to cut loose their women’s teams and that wrapping up the league now could prompt a dismissal of players and staff.Either way, players stand to lose. Footballers in the top two tiers of the women’s game are rarely on contracts of more than one year. Bar a handful at the very top, they are not yet afforded the security of lengthy contracts familiar in the elite men’s game. With the majority of contracts ending in June, and some only paid until the season was set to end in early May, players have been anxious to learn their fates and it is not implausible that, should the FA seek to play out the league season, players could find themselves playing their remaining games for other teams.Many players at Championship level on semi-professional contracts have second jobs and will also find their off-field employment impacted too. Scarily, these are players in one of the most secure footballing environments for women in the world.Vandevort highlighted the extent of the struggle globally. “After speaking with a number of players over the past several days, a few things have become clear to me,” she said. “First, communication is all over the map and, for the players, crisis management is happening largely at a club-by-club level. Some clubs are communicating consistently and clearly with their players, while others seem to barely share any information at all.“Second, there is a great deal of variance on whether clubs are allowing players to leave and return to their homes and families. In such a time of a global pandemic, players deserve the ability to make the choices that are best for their inidual health and well-being. Lastly, we’re hearing situations where player contracts are already being cancelled, and others where clubs have already restructured their budgets to eliminate women’s football altogether.“These times are unsettling and players are finding themselves in precarious positions regarding where they’ll be throughout the quarantine.”Vandevort said players should continue to contact Fifpro, but is also keen to direct them to local player associations. “We welcome players to get in touch with us if they have questions, but as a first point of contact wherever possible, I’d advise players to first reach out to their domestic unions since they’ll be most familiar with local labour laws and domestic footballing environments. It’s also worth sharing that over the last few years many of the advances in women’s football have come when players and their national unions have worked together to achieve progress.“From Denmark, to Ireland, Colombia, Chile, Cyprus, Spain and the US, women have achieved progress collectively. On an inidual basis it can be challenging but with teammates alongside you can become much more influential and can create long-lasting positive impacts.”It is highly likely teams will fold and players be discarded. Collective organising and experience sharing could be key in helping players navigate through this tumultuous period. Hopefully, clubs and governing bodies will rise to the challenge of providing support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d90b4830f1b073f35078fd6aadd2d191286fa2f/0_247_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f46d70614fc6b2868ac415c8be245e4","title":"readers recommend podcasts to binge on while youre cooped up in self isolation","story":"From Australian gothic mysteries to bawdy absurdist comedies, here are your recommended podcasts to while away this time of coronavirus social distancingThis podcast tackles the biggest business failures of all time.

But afterwards Hannah, now 31, could not remember which platform, or even the station, she had seen the man on.She looked out for him for weeks. Then, after leaving her office early one day, she saw him again – at Finsbury Park station. Next time, she promised herself, she would ask him out.The next day, there he was again.It was busy on the platform, so she hung back, steeling herself to go up to him. Ten minutes passed – and three or four trains. Imran noticed her still standing there on the platform. “You still here?” he asked.It was not “the most confidence-building thing” that has ever been said to her, Hannah remembers – but she seized her chance.“I said to him: ‘Are you a single man?’ He was very taken aback and said: ‘What, me?’ I thought: ‘Well, who else am I talking to?’”Imran did not have a working phone – which Hannah would come to know as typical of his haphazard approach to comms – so she gave him her business card.Imran, now 44, says he had never been asked out at work before. “It was a big surprise – a nice surprise.”He had noticed Hannah on the platform: “I thought she was gorgeous.” He also thought she might be “dangerous”. “To be honest, I was a bit worried. I was thinking: ‘What does she want to get with me for?’”At the time, Imran had been single for seven years, busy raising two children – then aged 16 and 17 – from a previous relationship. Dating had not been a priority.Their first date was a few days later at a pub near the station – “not even a nice pub”, says Hannah. She still ribs Imran about meeting her round the corner from where he worked, so his colleagues wouldn’t see them.She had worried there would be awkward silences, but they were still talking at closing time. It came as “a bit of a shock” to learn that Imran had two teenagers, Hannah says – “I took a huge gulp of my gin and tonic” – but it did not put her off. After the pub closed, Imran took Hannah to his favourite local chicken shop, and they ate sitting on a bench outside a club.It was “relaxed and convenient”, rather than glamorous, says Hannah – but they went on only one more “datey date”. “It became quite domestic quite quickly.”She remembers a point about six months in when Imran said he would be gone for an hour, then got caught up in errands and family, and went off-grid for the day – “a typical Imran thing”, she now knows. “I realised, as I was imagining these terrible scenarios, that I loved him, and that was why I was so irrationally worried and upset.“It all came out in this blubbery mess. I thought there was no way that this man was going to tell me he loved me, too – that he was far too guarded – but then he did.”A little over a year after their first date, just before Christmas, Hannah moved in with Imran and his younger son in Islington. “The house just feels better,” says Imran.He describes his relationship with Hannah as “two worlds meeting”, but they share values and like to spend time in the same way. He says she is intelligent, articulate, caring, empathic. “I like everything about her. She’s so good at everything she does, she doesn’t take any shit – I like that a lot.”Hannah says Imran is open-minded, patient, forgiving – “the yin to my yang”. “He’s got bundles of tolerance and compassion where I’m quick to be impatient, annoyed and judgmental. He’s definitely helped me to be a better person.”They bring out the best in each other, Imran agrees – this interview being a case in point. “I really wouldn’t normally do something like this because I’m such a private person. I think what did it, was she said: ‘Maybe it will give hope to somebody else.’”• Want to share your story?

Then Twitter, Instagram and Facebook followed. When I got home, I decided to keep culling …‘It always happens when you least expect it.” Or so the adage goes the romantic notion that the job of your dreams or the love of your life will appear when you’re not trying. In my life, this does not ring true: every job I’ve landed I tried very hard to get, and even in the realm of love there has been work to nurture and maintain it.But when it comes to better mental calm, it did arrive when I least expected it, as an unintended consequence of a tiny tweak: turning notifications off on my phone.I discovered this life-transforming trick while on holiday in Bali. I had already muted notifications related to work (email pings, Slack, Gchat), but still found myself woken up in the middle of the night by the phone vibrating incessantly from conversations happening in the UK across WhatsApp and social media. Next, I switched off all notifications for Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. I also silenced WhatsApp, which – with all the various group chats – could easily alert me more than 100 times a day.When I got back to the UK, I saw no reason to put any of these notifications back on, be it work or social. Life was still busy and hectic, but less harsh, somehow. It was as if someone had turned the volume down on my life ever so slightly.I decided to cull even more notices. The news blasts were the first to go: I did not need to be notified hourly about a worsening pandemic that I was helpless to do anything about. Then I disabled the notifications from the dozens of fitness apps that “remind me” (read: chide me) that I have not exercised that day, which I already know. Notifications of store discounts, gone holiday deals, goodbye. One by one, as a notification popped up on an app, I got rid of it, until just a few crucial ones remained (eg my period tracking app and the one with transport updates about my commute). Rather than my phone buzzing every 20 minutes, it was once every few days.I’d love to say that doing this brought down my overall screen time that without prompting I did not look at my phone as much. I’d love to say that the evils of the blue screen – their alleged impact on our sleep and keeping us sedentary – are now banished from my life, and that instead of hungrily reading articles or watching YouTube videos of Gordon Ramsay being mean to restaurateurs, I flick through history books and go for long walks. But turning off notifications did not give me a personality transplant. My internet-centric behaviours, long programmed inside me, did not wither away.Rather, what it did was stop the feeling of shock associated with being buzzed by the world. A notification, like a telephone call out of the blue, essentially says: “Stop everything and look at me right now.” It’s disconcerting it keeps you in a state of high alert that is stressful and draining, especially when the content may require immediate action. Think of cutting alerts like a digital detox, but less smug, more sustainable and still with access to Google Maps.Stress is the common factor in many behaviours widely understood to be bad for our health – drinking too much booze, smoking cigarettes, even eating unhealthy food. (There is some evidence to suggest that cortisol – the hormone released when we feel stress – makes us crave high fat and sugary foods.) And, these days, many of life’s stressors are communicated via the mobile phone. I cannot stop these stressors, but by turning off notifications, I can at least stop them ambushing me. It’s an action that helps me regain some sense of control. For example, when I open up a news app, I am ready to find out what is happening in the world. It is different from being in the supermarket cheese aisle and getting an alert, where – as part of a whole barrage of communications – I may feel blindsided.One of the great issues of modern life is our overinflated sense of importance. We think: “What if someone needs me urgently?” However, being “needed” is quite rare – wanted, maybe – but needed as an ordinary person who is not a head of state, health worker or something similar? I’m not so sure. Has anyone even noticed I am slower to respond? Have I had a single comment about being slower to reply, from anyone? The answer is a resounding no.I should mention that this neat little tweak is not a magic bullet. The fact I also do yoga and occasionally see a therapist plays a big part in my increased mental calm. But I felt the difference of doing this instantly, and it felt significant.Turning off notifications is the life-changing tweak that I will never go back from. It’s not a trick anyone can make money from, and so perhaps most people will never hear of it – although hearing less from the world might be exactly what is needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa77aebcbf97bd12f605dafc44600dc91c0306e6/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7252ac5a2a349bb33d1833bd84292459","title":"disney to launch streaming service as online viewing figures surge","story":"Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian and Frozen 2 among shows available to millions under coronavirus lockdownDisney is pressing ahead with the UK and western European launch of its Netflix challenger, Disney+, on Tuesday as streaming and TV viewing surges with coronavirus keeping millions of people at home.Disney, which is set to release online shows including the hit Star Wars live-action spin-off The Mandalorian and Frozen 2, is launching Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.“With much of the UK looking for entertainment while they are stuck at home, Disney+ is likely to be a big hit,” said Shiv Pabari, director of media and entertainment at Simon-Kucher \u0026amp Partners. “Families in particular will be excited by the content offered.”However, the launch in France has been delayed until 7 April at the request of the government to reduce pressure on broadband networks. Disney, Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and YouTube have all agreed to reduce the speed they deliver video streams to customers across Europe for a month to reduce congestion as online usage soars.As the UK woke up to the first day without schools, families turned to a live-streamed PE class by Joe Wicks, better known as The Body Coach, which attracted more than 1.6m views on Monday morning.“We had heard that Joe Wicks was saying he was going to be the nation’s PE teacher and we thought it would be good for the kids now we are all at home,” said Eren Dervish. “It worked for us. It was a fun, motivational start to the day.”Analytics firm App Annie has recorded double-digit percentage increases in the amount of hours spent using entertainment and video streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video, in recent weeks in European countries hit badly by the virus such as Italy.The same pattern is expected to be seen in the UK with TV viewing figures already soaring this weekend following the government’s move to shut pubs, bars and restaurants on Friday.ITV’s latest edition of Saturday Night Takeaway, which was filmed without a studio audience this weekend, drew the biggest audience since the show launched in 2002.However, the audience ratings are not translating to increased profits with ITV warning on Monday that advertisers continue to pull their spend. The company, which has seen its market value more than halve since the start of the year, has scrapped its idend, cut its £1.1bn programming budget and is seeking further cost cuts to save £300m to shore up its balance sheet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad8bf2dffcadb07193c06f37b22f46cbc25f015/0_936_2637_1582/master/2637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dc12eda4a83a14bd874603bc2b7b68d","title":"rick astley how we made never gonna give you up","story":"‘One day I was making the tea for Bananarama. The next I was at No 1’ I was the drummer in FBI, a jangly guitar band in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire. After I started writing a few tunes, I became the singer. Pete Waterman, the producer, saw us at a showcase in a working men’s club in Warrington. He heard my voice and went: “I can make a record with that kid.”I signed a deal, but within months Stock Aitken Waterman started having No 1s, so I was put on the backburner. Somebody – probably Pete – suggested I come and live in London so I wouldn’t get the hump and they could keep an eye on me. I lived in Pete’s flat. We’d go into the studio every morning and he’d be on his giant 80s mobile phone doing deals. I worked at the studio, making tea and sandwiches, but also watching how SAW made their records.They put out a single by me and Lisa Carter as Rick and Lisa, which didn’t do anything. Then they got a Fairlight synthesiser-sampler delivered. I helped them get it out of the box. I remember Mike inputting the chords to Never Gonna Give You Up. I made the tea while their programmer, Ian Curnow, did the basic track. Mike sang the melody literally into my ear and I went in and sang it. He was a tough producer but he needed to be. I was a kid who’d sung in pubs and clubs.We shot the video in an old church near London’s Westway. All the clothes in the video are my own. There were no stylists – I shoved some stuff in a bag. I really liked the song. I remember thinking: “I’d dance to that if it came on in a disco in Warrington.” I thought it sounded like a hit and suddenly it was. One day I was making the tea. The next I was at No 1.I turned up at Monks Social Club in a silver Ferrari. I don’t think anyone in Warrington had seen a Ferrari before, never mind a silver one. I was ill with flu, so I said to the guy on the door: “I’ll do 20 minutes, then I’ve got to get to bed.” But I stopped to watch the gig. I thought Rick’s voice was outstanding. And he moved quirkily, too. He reminded me of Van Morrison.I said to his manager: “Don’t like the band. Don’t like the song. I’ll sign the singer.” We put Rick on a Youth Opportunities Programme government training scheme. I wanted him to understand the music industry and be a real artist. He made the tea while the likes of Bananarama, Mel and Kim and Dead Or Alive made records, soaking it all up like a sponge. His voice was so strong that finding a song for him that worked was difficult. In some ways, he was actually too good.On Boxing Day that year, I was bored at home so I went into the studio. We pulled out Rick’s track and did a new version but forgot about that as well. Then one day someone played it in a meeting and everyone went: “What is this?” And the rest is history.It went to No 1 in every country, including America. Because he looked so young, people thought it wasn’t actually him singing – Radio 1 rang him up in a hotel in Scotland and made him sing it in the bathroom.• Rick Astley’s The Best Of Me is out now.

I’ve spoken about the opportunity for people to get out there and help their local communities and those in need. Nonsense to suggest otherwise. We all need to do our bit to get through this crisis.”Young Labour, which organised the conference call, said more than 3,000 members had joined in, with Corbyn also taking part in the discussion. It is part of a series of mass calls being organised by the party to deal with Covid-19, including sessions on workers’ rights and mutual aid groups.After Friday’s call, Young Labour tweeted: “The Labour party will continue to demand more from the government to support insecure workers and the most vulnerable, and Labour members in communities will be the centre of local support.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he was disgusted by Lavery’s remarks, accusing him of “salivating” at the thought of tens of thousands of people dying.A former Tory MEP, Steve Bannerman, who was also a member of Ukip, tweeted: “This disgusting and naked opportunism shows why we suddenly have so many social media attacks on Boris and government handling of Covid-19. Shameful. @UKLabour – would Attlee have done this??”Leftwing commentator and author Aaron Bastani said Lavery was simply highlighting that the response to Covid-19 would “demonstrate the uses of central planning and need for grassroots activism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf103f6ae01edb899269ffdca6bed8d39d35f84/831_1208_4067_2440/master/4067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aec72f6a35dd31a725af5b652cbb8f22","title":"do you have a scientific question about covid 19 coronavirus","story":"’s Science Weekly and Today in Focus podcasts want to hear your questionsAs the coronavirus outbreak continues to unfold, many of us have been left with questions.

Every year they meet for a series of games. The first team to win four games gets to take home the Golden Teapot and keep it for a year.The teams are evenly matched except for a small home advantage. When playing at home, each team has a 51 per cent chance of winning. (And a 49 per cent chance of losing. No ties are allowed.)Every year, the first three games are played at the home of Team A, and the rest at the home of Team B.Which team is more likely to win the Golden Teapot?Team B is more likely to win.The first to win four is the equivalent of ‘the best of seven’. So, there will be at most seven games. The piece of insight that makes the solution ‘simple’ is the realisation that deciding to play all seven games (regardless of outcomes) makes no difference to the issue of which team wins the series, and thus, since 4 of those 7 are home games for Team B, Team B has the advantage.The paradox is this: if you just play until one team has won four games, the average number of games played is less than 6, therefore most games actually played will be at the home of Team A.In other words, if the league statistician looks back over a great many years of the series, she will discover that Team A won most of the games, but Team B won most of the series!(The tricky part is to compute correctly that if you play until one team has won four games, that the number of games us less than six. The workings are shown below)Peter Winkler writes: “How can it be that home-field advantage for the seventh game, which is usually not played, is as good as home-field advantage for the first game, which is always played?“The answer is that something that is there when you need it is just as good as something that is there all the time. Home-field advantage in the seventh game is there when Team B needs it if they don’t get to the seventh game, they don’t need that advantage as the series has already been won or lost.”The calculation that shows that on average fewer than 6 games are played is a bit messy:The probability that just four games are played is .513 x .49 + .493 x .51  .12499998.Seven games: the remaining .31257503002.This results in an average of 5.81267507002, just a bit higher than we got without the home-field bias.Thanks again to Peter Winkler for today’s puzzle.

But scattering them wasn’t as simple as I had thoughtThe candlesticks and photo frames that usually adorn our mantelpiece have been usurped by four less conventional ornaments, and it doesn’t take long for visitors to notice. “Are they... ashes?” Well, yes – but they’re not so much a macabre display of what Americans call “cremains” as a small warehousing operation we’re working on the logistics to enable their respective onward journeys, but for now they are stuck here, above our fireplace. Visitors have other questions: why the Russian hats? Why is that one just a cardboard box? Let me explain.In December 2016, my 70-year-old Uncle Rod, my mum’s younger brother, died. His will, of which I was executor, left his body to medical science. Skeletal and riddled with metastases as he was, the doctors politely declined the gift. His will’s small print stipulated that anything left after his dissection should be cremated and scattered into the Avon from the Ashton Avenue Bridge, near his beloved Bristol City football ground.In life, Rod embraced the unorthodox, and he had mentioned to me years before that he didn’t want a funeral, just a “gathering” of loved ones. I decided the best way of honouring his wishes was to organise a direct cremation – one with no ceremony or witnesses – and a knees-up in the garden room at Bristol Zoo, one of his favourite haunts.About five weeks after his death, I answered the door to a man cradling a sturdy cardboard box in a canvas tote bag: Rod’s mortal remains. We chatted for a few minutes (mainly about how David Bowie had recently been directly cremated and therefore it had to be the coolest option), before he handed the box to me and left. I hadn’t held ashes before they were much heavier than expected. After a few stupefied seconds, I stood and cried for a solid minute, then placed the box on the sitting-room mantelpiece, under a Soviet-badged hat, next to my nan.Ah yes, Nan (and the hats). Rod’s flat had been decorated with remnants of his nomadic past Bobby Kennedy merchandise from the US, aboriginal flags and a didgeridoo from Australia, military memorabilia from eastern Europe. While clearing it out – a hurried process, because the council wanted it back – Dan, my husband, lifted a Cossack hat from a shelf and discovered a large green plastic bottle beneath it. Reading the label that dangled from its neck, he announced: “I’ve found your nan!”Dolly died, aged 90, in 2012 and left no instructions, so my mum popped her on the kitchen windowsill of the family home in Sheffield for a year or two, because “she always did love to see a line of washing”. Rod volunteered to return their mother’s urn to her birthplace, Newport in south Wales, and have her remains interred in her own mother’s grave. We’re not sure why Rod never made it, but we couldn’t leave Dolly in Bristol for the council to find, so she came back to Nottingham with us. It seemed only right to keep her hat on and when we found a second hat in the flat, obviously it had Rod’s name on it.When our thoughts turned to scattering, we decided it might be nice to send Rod and Dolly down river together, although my mum had her reservations (“But she can’t swim!”). Then Rod’s good friend Carol called us from Bristol to say that the Ashton Avenue Bridge was closed while extensive works took place, which is why, over two years later, Dolly and Rod are still sitting to the left of the mirror, under their furry hats.To the right of the mirror are the urns with the ashes of Dan’s Aunty Mary and her husband, John. This summer, when his 89-year-old aunt died, it was my husband’s turn to be an executor.Mary and John courted for 14 years before finally marrying in 2000, when she was 69 and John 65. But, after John’s death in 2014, Mary’s health began to deteriorate, especially her eyesight. She withdrew to her sofa, eating and even sleeping there. While clearing her house, Dan was a little more prepared for the shock of finding the green urn containing John, tucked beside the pillow at the end of the sofa that Mary slept on each night. So John came back with us until after Mary’s funeral, at which point they were reunited on our mantelpiece. This time there were no hats we didn’t want it getting gimmicky.Mary did express her wishes before she died: her ashes are to be scattered, along with John’s, on Woolley Edge, a Wakefield beauty spot. But John’s son from his first marriage is keen to be there, and ill health has so far prevented him from leaving his home in Spain. We’re waiting to coordinate timings for both scattering trips in the meantime the strange quartet will remain on the mantelpiece. They are family, after all, and hiding them away in a cupboard would seem inhospitable.According to Catherine Powell, customer experience director of Pure Cremation, there are almost 250,000 unclaimed urns in the UK. She says that even families who do have the ashes of a loved one can find it hard to agree what to do with them.Will I miss our four urns when they’re gone? The thing is, their very presence represents an absence, because they – Dolly, Rod, Mary and John – are already gone. They’re already missed. And I’m looking forward to getting those candlesticks back where they belong.There is very little legislation around ash scattering, but common sense applies in all settings: consider the effect on the surrounding area and those who use it, and avoid disposing of non-biodegradable tributes along with the ashes. You will also need to make sensible choices about wind direction.On private land You need permission from the landowner.On your own land No permission is required, and there’s no need to keep a record.At a cemetery, churchyard or natural burial site Easily arranged, by applying to the site manager – or ask your funeral director, if you have one, to act on your behalf. At a historic site or beauty spot National Trust England and Wales, English Heritage, Welsh Heritage, Historic Scotland and the National Parks will all consider requests made direct to the local property or landowner. No permanent site markers are allowed. Rather than scatter from or on popular mountain tops, placing ashes inside an out-of-the-way hollow or around a tree is preferred. (The Royal Parks in London and the Forestry Commission do not permit scattering.)At a sports ground Some football and cricket grounds and racecourses will allow ashes to be scattered pitch- or track-side, or sometimes in an adjacent garden of remembrance. Permission must be secured.On rivers or lakes The Environment Agency has published a leaflet about river scatterings, stating that ashes should not be put in water 1km from any drinking water supply, or from bridges over rivers used by boaters or canoeists, or anywhere close to a marina, anglers or bathers. If you can comply with these requirements no permission is necessary. If in doubt, contact your local Environment Agency office, which can also advise about tide times.At sea Many companies offer scatterings by boat all round the UK coastline, but you could also organise your own beach ceremony – again, provided you have consideration for others, and ensure it’s a sandy beach and the ashes are placed below the tide line.Further information is available at environment-agency.gov.uk.•\u0026nbspIf you would like your\u0026nbspcomment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2499092eb8646385caa000d6dde937b4258676/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c04f6eab57260a7e1c615efc626d3b5e","title":"coronavirus sport premier league tokyo olympics","story":"We must accept that it will be many months before packed crowds will be returning to watch live competitionWe still don’t get it. Even now, as death tolls rise exponentially across Europe and the greatest economic crisis of our age deepens, the white lies persist. That the football season could be completed by mid‑July. That the Olympics could take place a week or two after. That a bumper summer of sport will give the nation the mother of all pick‑me‑ups. It is an epic delusion. And, frankly, we have had enough of them already.Over the weekend I spoke to a leading expert, who is involved with the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, to ask him when sport as we know it – in front of packed crowds – might return. His response was sober and downbeat. “My expectation is that this is something that is going to be around for a long period of time,” he said. “There are no silver bullets on the horizon. We are talking months and months – and perhaps even next year and beyond.” Only charlatans, hucksters and superforecasters confidently claim to predict the future. But if we listen closely to the scientists and medical professionals we can anticipate what is coming next. Things will get worse.Many more people will lose their lives. The NHS will be put under enormous strain. And even after the peak – whenever that is – it will take time for social distancing measures to be relaxed and for the coronavirus to be behind us.The scientific expert I spoke to, on condition of anonymity, suggested that a best-case scenario was that an antibody test will be soon developed that will let us know if substantial numbers of the population have been infected and recovered. But, he stressed, it would probably still take six months for it to be developed, ramped up, and tested on the population.Meanwhile a vaccine might not be ready for 18 months, given it will have to go through the necessary safety trials.“We still have very little understanding of how prevalent Covid-19 is in the population,” he said. “And it may be that when we do have those tests, we’ll find out that, actually, there are huge numbers of people who have been exposed and have been asymptomatic and they are immune. That could be a game changer. But we just don’t know at this point. And it would be very reckless to assume that everything is going to go right after that.”Even if football returns behind closed doors – the best‑case scenario – there are obvious issues. If a single player tests positive for the virus then their whole squad will have to self-isolate for a fortnight, elongating the season further. And having ambulances at matches will be seen as hugely irresponsible if the NHS is still under severe strain. As the scientist put it: “We are in a very bad place. And we haven’t even spoken about the impact on the economy. Potentially you’ve got people not being able to afford to go to football matches.”Indeed as the crisis grows I wonder if our top clubs will start feeling a responsibility to help those lower down the food chain. If the Premier League clubs can fork out £250,000 each for Richard Scudamore’s £5m golden goodbye then surely they can find a pot of money to help lower league clubs.More top players should also thinking about giving back. Every fan feels that they have a symbiotic relationship with their club and without supporters paying for Sky Sports subscriptions and season tickets players’ salaries would be nowhere near as astronomical.Maybe before posting videos on social media from their lavishly decorated houses more players could put their hands in their pockets? It’s not as if they can’t afford it. According to the recent Global Salary Survey, the average basic pay for a Premier League first-team squad member is £61,024 a week – and that is before appearance fees, bonuses and any benefits. That’s a cumulative £30m a week in basic wages for the Premier League teams’ 25-man squads. Imagine the difference if every player offered to give up one week’s pay to charity? True, over the weekend Manchester United and Manchester City players donated a combined £100,000 to help food banks. That news was welcome, but it was still a drop in the ocean.At least on Sunday the International Olympic Committee acknowledged for the first time that the Tokyo Games could be delayed. The IOC has set itself a four-week deadline to decide. But given the widespread restrictions on public gatherings and closed training facilities are making it impossible for many athletes to prepare, Tokyo 2020 will surely morph into Tokyo 2021. Even if the virus has subsided in Japan come the summer, it will almost certainly linger in other countries. Would it really be wise to allow 10,000 athletes and close to a million spectators to fly in from across the globe?The expert repeatedly emphasised how uncertain the future looks. There could be a second or third wave of the virus. It could mutate into something worse. However, when I asked him whether there was any chance that this season’s Premier League and Champions League might be finished soon, or the Olympics could take place as planned, he was absolutely clear. “I think it’s delusional to think it’s going to happen. If people are saying that they’ve got absolutely no idea about what’s about to hit them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7152021636cf1bcc82e07b941a4232999fff748/0_85_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69d91617db1274a22dd5f51089cdffec","title":"japan olympic committee president considering postponing games tokyo 2020","story":"The head of the Japan Olympic Committee (JOC) said on Monday he had to consider postponing the Games among his options amid increasing calls from committees around the world to delay the Olympics due to the coronavirus outbreak.“From the athletes’ point of view of safety and security, we have to come to a stage where we cannot help but consider things including postponement,” JOC President Yasuhiro Yamashita told reporters on Monday. However, he said too long a delay would be a burden to athletes given the possibility of having to qualify again, for example.On Sunday the International Olympic Committee paved the way for the Tokyo Games to be postponed after giving itself a four-week deadline to consider its options. While the IOC has emphatically ruled out cancelling the Olympics, it said it will consider a scaled down Games as well as delaying them for a few months or, more likely, a year.On Monday Canada became the first country to warn that it won’t send its athletes to the Tokyo Olympics unless they are postponed for a year.The Canadian Olympic Committee said holding the Games as planned would threaten the health of its athletes, “their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training for these Games”.“In fact, it runs counter to the public health advice which we urge all Canadians to follow,” it said in a statement, hours after the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, conceded for the first time that postponement was now a possibility if the Games could not be held in their “complete form”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0925f48c7bb2143cd92bb40b5c4070d745565af/0_165_3707_2223/master/3707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7e37209fa52098fca413aa7f152728","title":"my favourite game usain bolt wins olympic 200m gold beijing 2008","story":"No one had got near Michael Johnson’s 1996 world record until the Jamaican giant scorched the Bird’s Nest and seared historyNo one was ever going to beat Michael Johnson’s record. Not in my young lifetime anyway, maybe some distant day when I was old and grey, and athletics had changed out of all recognition.Remember watching him set it at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996? That idiosyncratic style of his, back straight, carriage low, arms tucked, legs spinning so quick his gold spikes were like sparks from a Catherine wheel. He had a technique all of his own and maybe that explained why he was so fast. He finished in 19.32sec, three-tenths ahead of his own world record. The man in second place, Frankie Fredericks, ran faster than any one else ever had and he finished five metres back.Over the next decade, no one got near. Tyson Gay ran it in 19.62, Xavier Carter in 19.63, Wallace Spearmon in 19.65. They were the second, third, and fourth quickest 200m sprints in history, and Johnson’s time was so far beyond them it was in another realm altogether. Three of the fastest sprinters in history, and they were pootling around in Olympus’s foothills. There was another wannabe contender, a 20-year-old lean streak from Jamaica called Usain Bolt – a lazy trainer, they said, but lightning quick in the juniors.Bolt broke the 100m world record in May, two months before the Beijing Games. Then that Sunday night in Beijing, he did it again, in the Olympic final. You remember it, everyone does, how he started like a runaway armoire but gathered up so much track in the middle metres he stopped sprinting and spread his arms down wide, then turned to the crowd and slapped his hand against his chest as he came up to the finish line. There are lots of athletes who are so good they make winning look easy, very few so good they really find it so. He was one.What is less well remembered now is just how upset some people got about it all, how the president of the International Olympic Committee president, Jacques Rogge, called him out for “disrespecting his competitors” and said it wasn’t “the way we perceive being a champion”.Watching in the Bird’s Nest stadium, it wasn’t the swagger that bothered me but the split seconds it had cost him. We didn’t know, then, whether Bolt would run that fast again – Johnson never did – which meant he, and we, might never find out what he was capable of, where his limits, our human limits, really lay.Until four days later, when we found out.Bolt explained he had not been bothered about breaking the 100m world record, since it was already his. The 200m mark, Johnson’s impossible 19.32sec, was the one he wanted. Some day, maybe, Johnson said, but not now, not yet. Bolt did not have the speed endurance, he said, or the technique to handle running the curve, not at the levels he would need to beat that time. And who knew better? So far all he had done was trot through the heats and here he was clowning around on the start line without a care in the world.Then the gun went. His start was smooth and fluid, by midway around the curve Bolt had made up the stagger on the four men outside him, by the end of the curve he was metres ahead of them, and now it was just him racing history, chasing Johnson’s ghost.Bolt was out there on the very limits of possibility, pushing, pushing, pushing. This time he did not slow, there was no early celebration, he even threw his head and chest ahead in a dip finish. The clock stopped on 19.30sec. He had done it by two hundredths. I remember thinking, up in the stands: “So this is what it looks like when God tries for the line.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ff85d92cfd932385bd9ec3f43a6a94a946b6674/0_0_5391_3235/master/5391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e52dda8c7ad7dc8f41e25b1ded53e7a4","title":"polly swann continues tokyo preparation in isolation","story":"A silver medallist in Rio, the rower will continue her home training programme until the Olympics are officially postponedUntil last week, Britain’s rowers were some of the few sportspeople in the country still engaged in full-blooded competition. Great Britain’s squad trials for Olympic selection were held behind closed doors but brutally fought. It was, says the Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann, one of the closest trial meets she has experienced in her career.Swann’s pairs race was a “real ding-dong” against a pair including her own housemate, Rebecca Shorten. Sometimes, she says, trials can be more stressful than international competition. “You have to try to beat your friends, and you know how much it means to them.” The 31-year-old Swann and her partner Emily Ford were squeezed out in the last 200m.Swann is now off the water for the foreseeable future. On Saturday, Caversham closed its training facilities and moved all its athletes to at-home training programmes. Covid-19 had already caused the cancellation of all World Cup rowing, and while June’s European Championships remains for now, the probable postponement of the Olympic Games is dominating the International Rowing Federation’s agenda.Having recently completed the medical degree she began 13 years ago, Swann has no illusions about the seriousness of the pandemic and yet her desire to compete at the Olympics remains as strong as ever. “We have to believe there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” Swann says. “The Olympics is almost like a drug. That’s why athletes are able to put our lives on hold, move away from our loved ones, get up at ridiculous o’clock in the morning. So until there’s any kind of announcement that says there’s a postponement, we have to trust the Olympics will go ahead and we’d be silly not to do everything we could to prepare.”Isolation plans for the rowers had already been drawn up: exercise bikes and rowing machines will now take up space in lounges or bedrooms but Swann is used to awkward training regimes. Having resumed her medical studies after finishing second with the women’s eight in Rio, a sense of unfinished business drew her back to the sport. Trying to fit a bursting schedule of hospital rotations, exam revision, gym work and sleep into each 24-hour cycle nearly broke her.The week before her finals, a 5km indoor session left her in tears. “My coach was saying: ‘Polly, you’ve just got to do it.’ And I said: ‘I don’t know I can.’ At the time it felt like the worst thing I’ve ever had to do. Now I’ve got a bit of perspective. It wasn’t a global pandemic, put it that way.”Swann grew up in Edinburgh her mother is a former midwife and her father is a doctor, providing frontline help during the crisis. Swann, who is not yet registered with the GMC and will need a training post before she can practise, never imagined doing anything other than medicine.At school she showed some sporting aptitude, but her height made her “ungainly” – “I didn’t know where my legs and arms were in space and time!” she says, laughing. Struggling with hockey – she had an extra-long stick but still found reaching the ball on the ground difficult – she swapped to rowing, and was quickly smitten.Back injuries kept her out of contention for the 2012 Games the following year, she found herself paired with Helen Glover, who had won Britain’s very first gold in London with Heather Stanning. “We first got into a boat together in January of 2013 and I just remember being petrified,” says Swann, who remembers thinking: “‘Do not make a mistake!’” But Glover was a perfect mentor who “poured her heart into rowing” and by August that year they had won the world championships together.When Glover reunited with Stanning for their second Olympic gold in 2016, Swann took a place in the women’s eight, who nearly pulled off one of the most dramatic comebacks seen on the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon. Up against a USA boat unbeaten for a decade, the GB eight’s strategy was simple: start fast and stay with them. They did neither. At the halfway mark Britain were last.Swann remembers thinking all was lost when cox Zoe de Toledo made a bold call and began their sprint finish nearly a kilometre early. A surge of energy coursed through the boat, which soared up the field. “You get this all-encompassing belief from moving through the other boats,” Swann says. “Within 300m I was like ‘we’re going to win the Olympics!’“We were coming hot and heavy on the Americans and then with 100m to go my legs gave in and my lungs were exploding. I could hardly move.” USA took gold by two seconds but Swann and her teammates were thrilled with their fighting silver.Swann still wants a gold but her attitude to the Olympics has changed. Desperate just to make the team in 2016, she feels Tokyo would be, by comparison, “a bonus – the one I get to enjoy”. Which boat she might compete in remains a matter for the selectors. Swann enjoys the art of pairs racing – “you really get to feel the glide of the boat and how to move it well” – but also enjoys the sprint style of the eight, a charge she calls “vicious and electric”.The anxiety caused by the virus cannot be avoided – not in a sport overseen by a 73-year-old coach who must take special precautions to self-isolate as per government advice. Jürgen Gröbler’s charges had been joking he would probably self-isolate in a caravan by the side of the lake so he can keep an eye on them now he’ll be poring over data from their machines. A natural extrovert who thrives on teamwork, Swann finds the prospect of social distancing challenging but she already has plenty of her favourite tea in the house and has made a deal with Shorten that they will learn the guitar together.Whether she can fingerpick by the summer is uncertain whether the Olympics will happen even more so. But it’s a guarantee Swann and her fellow rowers will not sacrifice an iota of their training, wherever they have to do it. “We know the rest of the world will do the same,” she says. “And I think there’s something quite powerful behind that motivation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b441363a59ca36a28a5e190a7163fcdfa75484/0_245_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90f6495efc1a2ab965c07460134227e6","title":"sport radio chat show coronavirus isolation","story":"Shared experiences between people in separate places are quite the thing right now – plenty find the radio a comforting friendBig Del died last week. A fixture in my Brixton local, he hadn’t been in since Christmas and the cancer did for him pretty quickly in the end. Nobody in the pub, not even those closest to him, had known he was ill because he seemed the type who probably didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for him.A retired drayman, Del was a sweary old-school Londoner who loved his football, rooted for “those facking Gooners” and was England till he died. We’d even fallen out over it once nothing serious, a clash of nationalities more than personalities. He knew this mick co-presented a Sunday morning radio show on TalkSport and always made it abundantly clear he tuned in whenever he could. Occasionally in the strongest possible terms.More often than not, however, he came armed with a good-natured dig regarding anything he perceived to be controversially anti-Arsenal or England that I or my co-presenter Max Rushden might have said on air with which he disagreed. Our shared Sunday mornings in completely separate places meant we were never short of things to talk about when our paths did cross in the pub.Shared experiences between people in completely separate places are quite the thing now, whether they are cyber booze-ups on Zoom, Mother’s Day meet-ups on Google hangouts or groups of friends staying in touch through the medium of gallows humour on WhatsApp. And as people struggle with the anxiety of uncertainty in these weirdly unprecedented times, it seems plenty find the familiarity of old friends, some of them people they have never met on the radio, weirdly comforting.Sitting alone typing this column for a newspaper’s sport section at a time when there is no sport to write about, I am almost certainly not the only listener being kept amused by the sound of sports commentator Sam Matterface jovially bickering with his sidekicks – the former footballers Perry Groves and Stuart Pearce (each of whom I have met through work) – on a nearby radio.With four hours to fill on a Saturday afternoon that should have been jam-packed with football action, the panel are instead discussing the profundity of their urbane and dapper host’s ignorance on the subject of what a “larder” is. The word had cropped up in conversation, Perry had been agog that Sam had never before heard it and now all three are arguing over whether or not having a room specifically devoted to food storage in your house means you’re “posh”. I am prepared to concede that maybe you had to be there.Fast forward approximately 24 hours and Max and I have just come off the air after our two hours on TalkSport and, while tricky, it was highly enjoyable. Even in the absence of sport the show must go on and as purveyors of jovial, utterly inconsequential mid-morning tomfoolery we are apparently somehow considered key – if not absolutely key – workers at this difficult time.During a frightening period when we have seen the very best and very worst of people, medics, shelf-stackers and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus have been rightly lauded for their heroic efforts. Meanwhile the challenges being met by a pair of idiots with hours of sports radio to fill and precisely no sport with which to fill it have gone unheralded. That’s OK, we’re not in it for the glory or the plaudits. What Nick Cave once memorably described as “this tumbrel – this bloody cart of severed heads and glittering prizes”.There are those out there who will argue that filling time by “playing” the postponed FA Cup game between Sheffield United and Arsenal through the medium of a quiz is considerably less stressful than pulling 48 hours on the A\u0026ampE ward only to wind up weeping in the car park of an empty supermarket. What’s more, they would be absolutely correct. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is those questions didn’t ask themselves on Sunday, ultimately resulting in a highly controversial Arsenal win that comically enraged many listeners who support Sheffield United.Meanwhile on the ’s Football Weekly podcast, Max and I have vowed to continue delivering our twice-weekly show covering all the football that is not being played for as long as it takes and feedback has been heartwarmingly pleasing even if results have been mixed. A recent episode featured discussions about Australia’s A-League, Stuart Broad’s evolution as a top-class bowler and a monologue on the finer points of wood-chopping.It is a privilege to be lucky enough to have radio shows and podcasts to look forward to producing in the company of likeminded iniduals at a time when so many people have never felt so isolated, utterly bereft of companionship and downright bored. The inherent sense of camaraderie and community is a source of comfort and it is to be hoped our inane natter provides some sort of company and sense of familiarity to listeners whose ears are otherwise under constant assault from others engaged in far more important and largely depressing chat.I suspect Big Del would have got a kick out of tuning in to radio coverage of Arsenal denying Sheffield United a place in the FA Cup semi-final in a preposterously complicated radio quiz, effing and jeffing throughout and making a mental note to remind me of how the Blades had been the victim of “a facking stitch-up” when next he saw me down the pub.Although I never told him, I got a similar kick out of hearing from him and others who were out there tuning in to and laughing (or seething) at the latest drivel Max and I had dreamed up. With the world halfway to hell in a handcart, now seems as good a time as any to make sure each and every other one of our other listeners knows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa3f5b6722ceafea4bdf6745376ffff028c39922/0_83_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b674870d12d87f3a796be227068964","title":"fad or fixture are electric cars the future of motoring","story":"Electric vehicles have been celebrated as the greener, cost-efficient future of travel. Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

But as it has with so much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 found a way.In the early hours of Sunday morning, Palestinian health officials announced the first two cases in Gaza, from travellers returning from Pakistan via the Egyptian crossing. They were part of a trickle of people heading into the strip, around 1,300, who were placed into quarantine facilities, mostly in empty schools and hotels.Medhat Abbas, the general director of primary care in Gaza, said that other people the pair were in contact with had also been quarantined. “There is no need for panic at this stage,” Abbas said.“We can deal with existing cases and limited numbers, but if the pandemic increases, as happened in some countries, we will need international intervention,” he said. Gaza had only 40 intensive care unit beds, or 100 under emergency conditions, he added – far fewer than would be needed in an outbreak.For almost a decade and a half, this tiny slice of land has been in an artificial state of lockdown – locals call it a “siege” – under a crushing Israeli-Egyptian blockade.“We have become used to isolation,” said Ahlam al-Madhoun, 45, as she shopped in a supermarket for food. “Will the world understand that the isolation they live in for 14 days is the same as what we have been living under for 14 years?”While the blockade may have cut off Gaza from the pandemic, or at best delayed its entry, it is also blamed for what could be a catastrophic outbreak if the virus spreads.On Monday, the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem accused Israel of turning the strip into the “biggest open-air prison in the world”, one that is uniquely unsuited to deal with the pandemic.“Israel will not be able to deflect the blame if this nightmare scenario turns into a reality that it created and made no effort to prevent,” it said.Years of tight restrictions on people and goods have not only destroyed the economy but damaged almost every aspect of life. Meanwhile, three devastating wars between Israel and Hamas, a militant group that rules inside the strip, have entrenched the crisis, as have often-violent rivalries between competing Palestinian factions. More recently, a bloody Israeli crackdown on protests near the frontier has left thousands with bullet wounds, putting significant stress on hospitals.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIVAIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\u0026nbspWHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country’s health system.Gaza’s healthcare system was collapsing even before the pandemic, Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories, warned last week.“Its stocks of essential drugs are chronically low. Its natural sources of drinkable water are largely contaminated. Its electrical system provides sporadic power. Deep poverty amid appalling socio-economic conditions is prevalent throughout the strip,” he said. “Gaza’s population is also a physically more vulnerable population.”To block Covid-19, authorities in Gaza shut down wedding halls, banned weekly markets and asked people to stay at home.Ibrahim Raida, 31, a graphic designer, questioned whether the measures were enough. “They thought they are immune, but after the two cases … Gaza is a small place, and overpopulated, the virus can be easily spread.”The World Health Organization has sent in testing kits, personal protective equipment and goggles but said it might not be sufficient without additional international donations.The head of the WHO office for the occupied Palestinian territories, Gerald Rockenschaub, was in Gaza during the weekend and said containment was still possible. However, preparations for an outbreak should be ramped up immediately, he said.“What we need to do is to now move quickly to strengthen the capacities of the health system,” he said. “There are shortages everywhere.”Israel argues the blockade is a security measure needed to restrict its enemy Hamas, which has often fired rockets out of the strip. The UN, however, says its policy constitutes collective punishment on the strip’s roughly 2 million residents.Cogat, the defence ministry body responsible for coordinating Israeli government activity in the Palestinian territories, said it had mostly closed its foot traffic crossing into Gaza, although a separate entrance for trade was open. Israel had provided “hundreds” of Covid-19 test kits for Gaza, it added, without specifying.It would agree to exit for “life-threatening situations” and other extraordinary cases, a Cogat official said. Asked if Israeli authorities would allow Palestinians who might contract the virus into the country for treatment if Gaza’s health system were overburdened, the official replied: “This is under assessment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0f1b8330fd5b075c591f9ecae39338873749c9e/292_274_4145_2487/master/4145.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3444e37e72984b1d050f9662ac3f2c62","title":"can kids catch coronavirus what we know about covid 19 and children","story":"The health effects of the Covid-19 outbreak have generally been milder on children but many unknowns remainAs the number of Covid-19 cases rises worldwide, parents trying to protect their children from the disease can take solace in one thing: the disease has generally been milder in children.However, there are many unknowns about coronavirus, and research is ongoing. Here is what we know now.Yes. They can be infected with and appear to be able to transmit coronavirus, even if they do not have symptoms. That is why it is important for children to practice social distancing and hand-washing, even if they do not appear ill.It is generally believed to cause milder symptoms in children, but the specific impacts by age are becoming clearer as the outbreak goes on.That remains unknown. Dr Jay C Butler, deputy director of infectious disease at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, “The phenomenon is very significant,” on a live-streamed show hosted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, but that the mechanisms are “really unknown”.People aged 60 and older or with existing health conditions remain the most vulnerable to the coronavirus. That includes people with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory conditions, according to the WHO.Respiratory conditions such as asthma often result in more severe cases of viral diseases such as influenza. But the coronavirus is new, and it remains unknown whether it will more severely affect children with asthma.Similarly, there is not yet evidence about whether coronavirus could more negatively affect children with diabetes, which is a risk factor for adults. That said, experts at Johns Hopkins University are warning parents to be vigilant.In many countries that decision has been taken out of the hands of parents, with school and educational establishments being closed by governments and local authorities in order to try and halt the spread of the virus.If your kids are at home, they will still need regular exercise – and will need to be practising social distancing when they are outside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae86e7737e95ad969e38310c91b496c248963b04/0_380_5741_3447/master/5741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e134154da72007f2e7edf454c943d8e","title":"colombias narco submarines a photo essay","story":"For years, they were referred to in hushed tones simply as “Big Foot” – a mythical creature rumored but never seen – but these days, the narco-submarines used by Colombia’s drug cartels have become almost commonplace.Photographs by Luis RobayoAFP, written by Florence PanoussianAFPWith cocaine production at an almost record high in Colombia, authorities on the country’s Pacific coast say crude semi-submersible craft have become a favoured tool to smuggle drugs toward the US, and even to Europe.Thirty-three submarines were intercepted in 2019, an average of almost three a month, most of them along the Pacific coast. That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c77fbe8ab122cb55f7cbbd31d551a2b41317be/0_326_5108_3067/master/5108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f233b1677e861de8a45a41a56f26fa","title":"coronavirus how do italy and the uk compare","story":"With Britain approximately two weeks behind Italy in Covid-19 deaths, questions about the nations’ similarities remain The coronavirus established itself early on in Italy where reported deaths are now in excess of those recorded in China.But is the crisis witnessed in Italy about to play out in the UK? And when are lockdowns and other interventions likely to start to make a difference?Though there are some similarities – the picture is complexThe death toll in Britain is roughly two weeks behind that of Italy, according to researchers who have analysed the data.In week 10 of this year, ending 6 March, Italy announced 176 new Covid-19 deaths, comparable to the 166 deaths the UK reported in week 12.If the spread of the pandemic in the UK tracks Italy’s closely, the domestic death toll could soon rise sharply.Italian authorities recorded 1,066 new Covid-19 deaths in week 11, the equivalent of this week in the UK’s outbreak.“It looks as though we are two weeks behind Italy in number of Covid-19 deaths,” said Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the MRC’s Biostatistics Unit at Cambridge University.“But all this means is that we have comparable population sizes and had a comparable number of deaths in week 12 as Italy had in week 10. We may be on a less steep trajectory than Italy, but it’s too early to know yet.”Spiegelhalter stressed that the outlook was “all very uncertain at the moment” not least because the two populations and their nations’ responses to the outbreak differ so much. There was “some reason for hope,” he said of the UK situation, “although we will must be ready for having hundreds of deaths a day.”The same analysis hints that Italy may be approaching a peak in its epidemic, but the answer will only be clear if the country continues to report falling numbers of new deaths over the coming days and weeks.The UK’s peak may not be so severe if the UK’s response to the outbreak has been effective, Spiegelhalter said, but the answer to that is not yet clear.Compared with Britain, Italy had less time to prepare, the virus may have been circulating more widely before it was detected, and the country has more older people who are more tightly connected to family and friends.However, comparisons present problems, as it’s not possible to truly compare like-with-like.One factor that will have a substantial impact on deaths is the capacity for hospitals to care for the most seriously ill patients, and this differs markedly from country to country. “When you hit the capacity of intensive care beds then you might get an additional shift up which could reset the rate of increase thereafter,” said Bird.Testing and the number of confirmed cases is also an issue.Differences in testing policy, for example, will account for some of the variations in mortality rates as testing more patients will increase the number of confirmed cases, and is likely to reduce the overall mortality rate. Data on patient characteristics such as age and underlying health conditions is another factor we don’t know about.As Adam Kucharski, who is modelling the outbreak at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, points out, deaths reported today do not reflect the state of the epidemic at the moment.Those who die are typically infected about four weeks earlier. “Strictly speaking we should say something like: transmission in the UK four weeks ago was where Italy was about six weeks ago,” he said.For the same reason, the impact of the cascade of lockdowns across Italy, and ever more stringent restrictions on movement brought in across the UK, will take time to show up in the daily death tolls. A wave of Italians fled to the country’s south when news leaked on 8 March that the government intended to quarantine 16 million people in the high-risk north. If those people carried the infection with them, the deaths that result are not likely to show up until at least the start of next week.In the UK, where pubs, clubs, restaurants and theatres shuttered only days ago, and school closures began this week, any resulting impact on deaths will not be apparent until mid-April soonest. “It’s quite likely to be at least three weeks before we see a slow down in the deaths. And they will potentially still be increasing. It depends how much social distancing we’ve managed to achieve,” said Bird."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i see a doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 22 March, more than 339,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 14,700 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 5,400 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 98,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

A full G20 world leaders teleconference is due later this week, but whether a consensus can be reached on a global fiscal stimulus is not clear.Finance ministers insisted Monday’s virtual G20 meeting had been worthwhile.France’s Bruno Le Maire tweeted had discussed the pandemic’s “violent impact on the global economy, financial support for developing countries, and preparations for a common exit strategy from the crisis”.Hopes of a coordinated international response are hampered, however, by a diplomatic and propaganda standoff between China and the US focused on claiming moral authority once the virus is brought under control.The two countries have been trading insults for the past two weeks over responsibility for the pandemic. They are also competing to show that they are able not only to bring it under control, but also to emerge stronger economically afterwards.Chinese officials suppressed information about the outbreak, but Beijing has  positioned itself as a global benefactor, sending doctors and medical supplies to Iran, Iraq, the Philippines and Serbia. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, greeted a Chinese aircraft at Belgrade airport, applauding the newly arrived doctors and kissing the Chinese flag. “European solidarity does not exist,” he said. “That was a fairy tale on paper.”Two teams of Chinese doctors with aid supplies have arrived in Italy and a third is on the way.The Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, has also told the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, that Spain can can count on its assistance and supplies. “Sunshine always comes after the rain,” he said. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced last week that China would provide Europe with 2m masks and other supplies.The Chinese private sector has joined the effort. Beijing’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, tweeted this week: “Jack Ma e-commerce tycoon pledged to donate 100,000 masks, 20,000 test kits, 1,000 protective suits \u0026amp face shields to each of the 54 countries in Africa”.China has also not been slow to spot a commercial gap in the market. Some factories are working round the clock to produce the ventilation equipment the US and EU need. “There’s literally no country in the world that doesn’t want to buy a ventilator from China right now.” said Li Kai, the director of Beijing Andromedae. “We have tens of thousands of orders waiting. The issue is how fast we can make them.”It may be easier for China to show this enterprise, because as the country seemingly first in and out of the epidemic, it is further ahead on the learning curve. Following a phone call between Xi and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, China has shared the genome sequence of the virus and its scientists have sped up publication of papers on it. Beijing’s international standing has only been helped by floundering in Washington, and Donald Trump’s determination to indulge in a nationalistic blame game.As the personal stakes have risen for the US president, so has his anti-Chinese rhetoric. He has also defended his decision to repeatedly refer to “the Chinese virus”. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who has described the Chinese Communist party as the biggest threat to world security, went further, attacking China’s lack of transparency and accusing it of putting countless lives at risk.Chinese officials for their part have blamed the outbreak on the US. The Chinese ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, did however use an interview on HBO at the weekend to reiterate his statement of 9 February that it would be “crazy” to spread conspiracy theories that the virus had been created in a US military laboratory.The danger is that not enough diplomats in Beijing or Washington will show the same maturity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883780f5e17542dd87d86f32e628f371acbf2977/275_66_3039_1823/master/3039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a2b6e8cd24b2d1353b5ac5132c2601","title":"how is your university supporting you during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"If you are a university student we want to hear how your institution is supporting you Students at Oxford and Cambridge will have their summer exams replaced with online assessments due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Enough is enough.”Speaking from self-isolation after his wife tested positive tested positive for the coronavirus more than a week ago, Trudeau suggested his government could close of provincial borders and use the law to ensure people respected quarantine rules and practice social distancing.Trudeau’s remarks came before an evening call with provincial premiers who are expected to discuss both the possibility of closing provincial borders and levying steep fines for anyone caught congregating in a large group or ignoring orders to self-quarantine.Both Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have recently taken the rare step of requiring everyone entering the province to self-isolate for two weeks, even if travelling from a neighbouring Canadian province.Canada closed its shared border with the US last week to all non-essential travel.Trudeau’s comments came a day after his weekend address to the nation’s children, thanking them for their sacrifice as uncertainty and isolation weighed heavily on daily routines and social networks.“All of a sudden, you heard you can’t go on play dates or have sleepovers, your playgrounds and schools have closed and your March break was certainly different than what you’ve hoped for,” he said on Sunday.“I know this is a big change, but we have to do this not just for ourselves, but for our grandparents, our nurses, our doctors and everyone working at our hospitals and you kids are helping a lot.”The country has seen growing calls in recent days for the federal government to invoke the Emergencies and Quarantine Acts, two mechanisms that grant the federal government enormous power.Trudeau has so far been resistant to use such extreme measures— as have civil liberties groups – but he reiterated that “everything is on the table”.For now, he said, much of the responsibility to fight the pandemic remains with residents.“Fundamentally, is comes down to citizens making smart choices.”The country is poised to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. Trudeau has recalled parliament for Tuesday where lawmakers are expected to pass billions in aid for unemployed Canadians and industries hard hit by the economic downturn.After testing more than 100,000 people, Canada has reported nearly 1,500 cases of Covid-19 – with 20 deaths attributed to the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec24c8b8e826f991dd0b15468fd8a1c4366ab53/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4370cf0d0e70823669449dec72b4c4f8","title":"london covid 19 doctor staff choose whose life to save","story":"Rosena Allin-Khan, a Labour MP and A\u0026ampE doctor, reveals ‘heart-wrenching’ decisions facing hospital workersRosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting and an A\u0026ampE doctor, is still working regular shifts. On Sunday she worked at St George’s hospital in her south London constituency. She explains how the coronavirus pandemic has affected staff:I’ve been an A\u0026ampE doctor for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. The departments are quieter because people are staying away from hospital, but the patients are sicker. We’re seeing a distinct rise in the numbers coming in with respiratory symptoms, who are testing Covid-19 positive.On Sunday, very early in the morning, the entire resuscitation department, where the absolute sickest patients go, was full to capacity with patients with breathing difficulties. We had to move other very ill patients to the paediatric resuscitation area to keep them safe.This is only set to get worse. We’re seeing patients now who would have only contracted the virus two weeks ago. In the coming 10 days we expect the entire A\u0026ampE department will be taken up with suspected Covid-19 patients.Doctors and nurses are brave, and the A\u0026ampE department is known for being on the frontline and high risk, but there’s a palpable fear among staff for three reasons. Firstly, they’re frightened for their own health and those of the people they love. When I finished my shift yesterday, which was Mother’s Day, I came back to the house and I couldn’t touch or hug my two little girls until I put all my clothes in the wash and had a shower.The second reason is that staff expect, very soon, potentially to have to make heart-wrenching choices about whose life can be saved if we don’t have enough ventilators. That goes counter to everything you’ve ever learned as a doctor or nurse – to make life-and-death decisions, where we could possibly have saved every one of those people, is unimaginable. This is what our colleagues in Italy are living through now.Third, the patterns described thus far for symptoms of coronavirus are not what we’re now seeing in the emergency department. We’re seeing young, previously very healthy people, who are ill in hospital. Some are in their 30s, and they need ventilators to stay alive. Some patients are presenting with abdominal pain, which we hadn’t heard of before. A person can come in and say they have a stomach pain, and they’re put in the “green” area of the department – but then they mention they also have a cough. Everybody should be assumed to be Covid-positive until proven otherwise at this point.There’s also a real concern among staff around the country about personal protective equipment. They either don’t have any, or if they do many feel it’s being rationed. It’s very hard to listen to some colleagues say that as a result of there not being enough equipment to go round, they’re resigned to catching the virus – it’s just a matter of when.On social distancing, the messaging from the government hasn’t been clear enough. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has banned public gatherings of more than two people. It’s clear and easy to understand. There has to be no ambiguity in the language because people’s lives depend on it.Some people are treating this as a holiday – but without correct distancing measures it’s a disaster waiting to happen. When we are faced in the coming weeks with choices about who gets the last ventilator and who doesn’t, it will be that young person who has gone out socialising, who has ignored advice, who get it. That means someone else’s mother may not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2b469d4e5bdc957716bd8c779069ef2e6c83fca/0_216_4741_2845/master/4741.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e061041d8d31a8b62bfe9fe207bd3340","title":"mps to review coronavirus emergency laws every six months","story":"No 10 says sweeping powers will be subject to renewal, after Commons pressureEmergency legislation giving ministers sweeping powers to ban gatherings and forcibly quarantine suspected coronavirus patients will be reviewed every six months, Downing Street has announced, following pressure by MPs and rights groups.The coronavirus bill, which is expected to pass every stage in the Commons on Monday without being put to a vote, gives the powers for a two-year period. As published, the only safeguard would be an obligation for ministers to report on its use every two months.Labour and other opposition parties, as well as some Conservative MPs, had said that while they recognised the need for the powers, which the government has stressed it will use only if needed, they were worried about the timescale.On Monday, before the first stage of the bill in the Commons, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the measures would now be reviewed every six months.“We are grateful to the opposition for their constructive approach considering this legislation,” he said. “The measures in the bill are temporary, proportionate to the threat we face, and will only be used when strictly necessary.“However we recognise the importance of parliamentary scrutiny and have heard concerns about the need for periodic reviews of the powers in the bill. We have therefore this morning tabled a government amendment to the bill to require the House of Commons to renew the legislation every six months.“Should the Commons decline to renew the temporary provisions, the government will be required to bring forward regulations to ensure that they expire. The two-year time limit for the act overall remains in place, and not all of the measures will come into force immediately.”Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

There are real concerns about our right to protest through to care for the disabled. Boris Johnson and his government’s record and rhetoric on civil liberties was never its strong suit. To now hand them powers like this without review would be to court disaster.”Among possible powers in the bill is for police, public health and immigration officers to detain people suspected of having Covid-19, force them to isolate, and fine them if they refuse a test.Other elements of the bill give legal force to the closure of schools and nurseries, allow ministers to ban gatherings, and gives extra powers to intervene if the government suspects anyone is disrupting the distribution of food. Another element would permit the closure of the UK’s borders if too many border staff fell ill.The bill would also allow only one doctor, rather than two, to oblige someone with mental illness to receive treatment, with time limits loosened for how long they could be detained. It also eases the legal obligations on councils in providing social care to older and otherwise vulnerable people.Other measures intended to ease pressures on the NHS would allow recently retired medical staff and students who have nearly qualified to work immediately, with protection given against any negligence claims. Other provisions are connected to improving access to statutory sick pay, and speeding up the process for funerals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36397ab50cead3f239b84fae2a09ee6f31446f7d/0_49_5196_3118/master/5196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73c55407deb41fbfb79e7848711c41e8","title":"uk doctors stuck abroad criticise foreign office lack help","story":"Those keen to join NHS’s fight against coronavirus say they have received little assistanceDoctors who are among those stranded overseas have said they are desperate to return to help their NHS colleagues battle the coronavirus outbreak, but that they have received little help from the Foreign Office (FCO).Travel restrictions around the globe have left an estimated 1 million British people marooned, with many complaining that their host countries have organised rescue flights for their citizens but the UK has not.The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has called for urgent talks with the FCO, saying not enough is being done to repatriate people who cannot get home because there are no flights. “I think we need a centralised response.

I was due to fly home to the UK from Pakistan last night. When I arrived at the airport I was told my flight would be cancelled as they were stopping all international flights with immediate effect.” He was told there would be no flights for another fortnight at least.“At a time when doctors are being called out of retirement, and everyone is being asked to pull together and help amidst this crisis, I feel so helpless as I am stranded abroad with no means to come back home,” said the doctor, who asked not to be named.“We have attempted to contact the British embassy who state they cannot help as they also have no news.”In New Zealand, which is due to go into lockdown on Wednesday, a group of more than 300 Britons including many health workers are also stranded.Daisy Ifama Samuel, who is behind a WhatsApp group in New Zealand, said there were older people, ill and pregnant women among the 300 trapped in the country.Her friend Catherine Dabrowksa said: “The embassy have been absolutely appalling.” They said they went to the offices but came away with a note about washing hands and general health advice.Also stranded in New Zealand is lawyer Anna Gregg, 28, from Cumbria. She complained her airline, Emirates, the travel insurer and the FCO were each trying to offload responsibility onto the other.“We can manage, but we’re anxious to be so far away from home, and with no obvious end to any of this. Some people on the WhatsApp group are on their own with little money, others are medics or key workers. We just want to be home, near our families,” Gregg said.One GP who is there with his wife, who is also a doctor, said he was “trapped” with no way to come back to the UK after travel restrictions were imposed.He said he tried to contact the consulate by phone and social media, and ended up taking a flight to South Island to physically visit the office in Wellington only to be turned away on arrival with nothing but a list of generic websites. Another said he and his friend had gone out to New Zealand to work for six weeks in the Auckland City hospital and Starship children’s hospital, but were now stuck with no help from the embassy. “Our colleagues are fighting a war back home that we should be helping with,” they said.Adrienne Newton, 60, a recently retired GP, said she was willing to return to work in the NHS but her flight from Argentina was cancelled and the local embassy could not help.“They said the airspace was closed talk to your airline. They did absolutely nothing. Eventually I got through to London,” she said. “The lady I spoke to didn’t ask for our names, how old we were, whether we were in safe accommodation, or what was our health like, she just said sign up for the updates on email, so it was a bit of a surprise to read they were putting on flights to Peru.“So it seems they can change their minds when they are shamed by the media, but they will leave the rest of us alone. This needs to be a coordinated diplomatic effort. It is not a matter of ringing your airline any more.”On Saturday the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, announced the UK was laying on flights for hundreds of Britons stranded in Peru after criticism.Thornberry wrote to all Labour MPs at the weekend asking them to pass on details of any constituents stranded abroad in an effort to create a centralised database, in the apparent absence of any such initiative by the FCO.The FCO has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ddbd91944a134404dbbe0332b7aa3beb3b370e/0_326_6133_3680/master/6133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d2321b817d86b6f01e708071302e56","title":"uk lags behind other countries in coronavirua social distancing data shows","story":"Sources tracking behaviour such as transport use and restaurant bookings show measure slowly taking holdSocial distancing is happening in the UK, but the country lags behind others in some of the key measures, according to data gleaned from a variety of sources over the past seven days.Transport use is down, restaurant bookings are non-existent and more people than ever are working from home, according to companies operating across Britain’s technology industries.

In my birth country of Sudan, after only one case and one death was registered, all schools and universities were shut down. Several other nations, such as Egypt, have taken the ultimate precaution and closed their airports.There is no denial here, no mixed messaging, and no unfounded promise of how soon we will send the virus packing.The tough and timely action is borne less out of political maturity than it is bitter experience, and an awareness that already overburdened public healthcare systems cannot sustain an onslaught. The ebola epidemic of 2014 is still fresh in the mind in sub-Saharan African countries it was an experience that showed prevention and containment are the only hope of fending off thousands of deaths.If we are concerned about the failure to contain the virus in western Europe and the US, multiples of that horror await in the developing world. With few means of medical intervention, and several other risk factors such as malnutrition, high population densities, communal living and lack of access to water and washing facilities, the rates of mortality could dwarf what has been seen so far in the west. And economically, the virus risks ushering in an ice age. There are no war chests, no stimulus packages, no insurance payouts.There is something painfully predictable about how coronavirus was introduced to the continent. Well-off travellers to the rest of the world returned from holidays and business trips carrying the virus, as did infected tourists. In Egypt, the first cases of Covid-19 appear to be linked to one cruise ship, where locals who served the tourists contracted the disease.The spread of the virus on the continent sits in the crosscurrents of travel and financial flows that expose African countries to the sharp end of globalisation – one where the flow of people is encouraged into the continent for business and tourism, and severely restricted out of the continent even for the wealthy and well connected.It is the recurring theme of how the pandemic has played out so far. The poor, the uninsured, the disenfranchised, the information-poor and the less mobile are sitting ducks. Many western economies, including the US and the UK, have slowly pushed these people to the margins, while restricting employment benefits such as holiday pay, sick leave, and private insurance to an increasingly exclusive class. One of the reasons the British and US governments have been so slow to provide free testing, medical care and bailouts for those who’ve lost work is that these inequalities are now hardwired into the system. They cannot be undone overnight even when lives depend on it.The global economy is set up in much the same way, with winners who hoard the spoils, and losers who scratch around for the leftovers. If wealthy single countries cannot scramble to save their own people, there is no hope for any effort to extend help to countries with a fraction of the resources.But here is the tragic catch for those who think that this structural imbalance is not our problem. In this instance, national and international inequalities cannot persist without everyone losing. The realisation is just beginning to dawn upon lawmakers that the rich cannot be barricaded against the poor, no matter how high the barriers to the fortress are. Limiting the spread of the virus entails ensuring that everyone in the pool, be it local or global, is given the ability to test, self-isolate if need be, and receive treatment.Yes, to some extent this is a utopian aspiration. But it is also essentially pragmatic. We cannot extol the virtues of small government and global societies without grasping that the risk to the majority cannot be halted from spreading: viruses do not distinguish between classes and nationalities.Just as work and public life cannot be shuttered for ever, borders cannot be closed indefinitely. African countries are moving fast against coronavirus, well aware that they are on their own. But barring a miracle, or a pandemic Marshall plan by wealthier countries, if the virus explodes in poorer countries, the cataclysm will engulf everyone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209790.1584976130!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a statistic in a global pandemic irish times journalist describes contracting coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t journalist Glen Murphy who is recovering from coronavirus. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe parents of  journalist Glen Murphy, who is recovering from coronavirus, have been left waiting for days for test results despite showing symptoms of the disease and having had contact with their son.Murphy was diagnosed on Sunday, March 15th and immediately went into self-isolation at home. His symptoms have largely abated since then.On Friday, his mother was admitted to hospital with pneumonia and was tested for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, the following day. At the time of writing on Monday, she had not yet received her test results.His father has also experienced mild symptoms associated with the virus but was not tested until this morning, eight days after his son’s diagnosis.At a briefing on Sunday, the HSE’s chief operations officer, Anne O’Connor, said the average waiting period for a test was four to five days.HSE chief executive Paul Reid has acknowledged that delays in testing had begun to build up and that thousands more testing kits would be distributed this week.“I just can’t understand how people in such close proximity to a known case aren’t prioritised,” he told deputy editor Deirdre Veldon.He waited for three days to be tested after developing symptoms, being told his case was not a priority as he had not travelled to what were then the affected areas. Since then, HSE criteria for testing have changed. Anyone displaying normal cold and flu symptoms is instructed to self-isolate at home and call their GP who will advise on their need for testing.The arrival at his apartment of medics in protective attire was shocking, he said. “I was expecting the person to be in the full getup but when you see them standing in front of you, it’s a very different experience. It does nail it home that you’re a statistic in a global pandemic”.Murphy provided the names of approximately 40 people he was in contact with in the days before his diagnosis. “I assumed every single person I was in touch with would be tested.That’s not the case at all”.Even while suffering from the worst of the illness, Murphy’s main concern has been for the wellbeing of his parents.“The hardest part no doubt has been worrying about my mam, since she went into hospital, it’s just very uncharacteristic for anyone in my family to be in hospital” he said.He urged people to keep their distance from others.“Social distance rules exist for a reason, they will absolutely save lives of people who are more vulnerable to this disease,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph Jonathan Bradshaw.The Government will seek to keep public spaces such as parks, forests and beaches open for people to use but will emphasise the need for everyone to maintain social distancing.Four people have died and there are currently 906 positive cases of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, in the Republic.In Northern Ireland, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 20 on Monday to 148. To date, two people have died of the virus in the North.At a briefing at Government Buildings on Monday morning, a senior official said that the Government would consult with national parks, Coillte, the Heritage Council and local authorities “to develop clear, simple public messaging so we can continue to enjoy these public spaces at this time”.Elizabeth Canavan, an assistant secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach, told journalists that the Government had received “significant feedback from the public in relation to the lack of social distancing”.“It’s clear that that the vast majority of people are complying with the guidelines, but clearly compliant is not universal,” she said.She said the Government would seek to keep public spaces open while reinforcing the need to keep distance between people.Ms Canavan also said anyone who applied for social welfare payments last week would receive a payment in their bank accounts tomorrow. However, she warned that scammers are contacting people purporting to be from the Department of Social Protection asking for bank details.“You will not get a phone call asking for your bank details from the Government,” she said. Social protection payments would be made every two weeks, she said.Ms Canavan also said that immigration applications would now move online, and the immigration offices in Dublin had now closed.Further restrictionsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar indicated the Government is not thinking in terms of implementing severe restrictions on movement at this moment in time but may impose some further restrictions.Mr Varadkar responded to scenes over the weekend where parks and public places - especially in Co Dublin and Co Wicklow - became very crowded by saying that people had probably gone to those places not expecting such large crowds.“In fairness to those people they probably turned up not realising how crowded they were going to be,” he said.“I don’t think we should be berating people about this. We have asked the Chief Medical Officer and the National Public Emergency Team to examine that with a view to coming up with more recommendations for Government tomorrow.“If they recommend further restrictions we will implement them,” he said.Mr Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris both emphasised the evidence emerging from contact tracing teams of the social distancing measures having already had an impact.“Most people most of the time are adhering to social distancing,” said Mr Varadkar.“We see some evidence in the contact tracing that that is the case,” he said.He said any decision that will be made on social restrictions “will not be made because of what is trending on Twitter, because of populism or political pressure”.He said it would be based solely on expert advice.Earlier on Monday morning, Mr Harris said social distancing is not “something nice to do, it is about saving lives”.Ireland cannot go the way of Italy, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.It was important to look after people’s physical and mental health, but mass gatherings in parks were “not on”, he said.Mr Harris said he had been overwhelmed by the sense of solidarity being displayed around the country and also by the dedication of those in the health service. The welfare of health care workers was key and everyone needed to work “extremely hard” to protect health workers.When asked about the possibility of further restrictions, Mr Harris said people were making a conscious effort at social distancing. He said he would await greater guidance about playgrounds and public spaces.People still need to abide by social distancing, he said. People must stay two metres apart.The president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr Mary Favier, has said it was inevitable that more measures will be introduced to ensure physical distancing.Dr Favier told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that “physical distancing” was a much better description than “social distancing” and that more needed to be done as “particular groups” did not seem to understand the necessity for physical distancing.It was up to us as a society to make the personal decision to create a physical distance rather than to have to introduce mandatory measures, she said. Ultimately it was people in the community who would save lives, doctors would “pick up the pieces.”Back logDr Favier acknowledged there was a significant back log on testing, but pointed out that GPs could not expedite tests or results which would go directly to patients.“We would ask people not to ring their GP, we don’t have the information.”However, she said that anyone who developed respiratory symptoms or anyone who was awaiting testing and their symptoms got worse should immediately contact their GP.Testing for health care professionals was vital, added Dr Favier as there was already a shortage of GPs in the country and the health service could not afford to have GPs going into isolation while awaiting testing.Speaking on Newstalk, Mr Harris said orders of face masks, goggles and gowns were being packed up in China and an airline was going to collect them, they should arrive by the end of the week.On the issue of wait times for tests – Mr Harris said the changed criteria for testing had brought about huge pressures. Efforts were under way to get more testing kits, there are now far more testing centres and there are 10 labs around the country running the tests.“We are testing, testing, testing, but the most important thing is that if you think you have the symptoms you must self-isolate. That is the most important thing you can do for yourself, your family, your country.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209421.1584913495!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD could close public spaces under proposed coronavirus measures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Dollymount beach on Sunday.

Adding the time it takes to process the test, many patients are waiting a week to find out if they have the disease.Acknowledging the delays, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said 40,000 testing kits were being distributed at the moment and 20,000 more would be available on Wednesday. He said the HSE was in advanced negotiations with China to secure another 100,000 kits. Testing will be available at 41 centres nationally from Tuesday.Cork GP Dr Nick Flynn described the backlog of people waiting for tests as “a problem”.“The success or failure of our delay strategy is all about early diagnosis of the disease and early contact tracing. It’s not good enough simply to say that people waiting for a test are self-isolating.”Dr Flynn said it would also be helpful to know what percentage of tests carried out so far are still awaiting processing.The new movement restrictions, which may be applied to areas such as beaches, parks and caravan parks that become overcrowded, are due to be considered by the National Public Health Emergency Team tomorrow.The proposals have been drawn up following concerns that large groups of people who gather at beaches, mountains and walking routes – as during fine weather over the weekend – could be helping the spread of the disease.The emergency team is also likely to recommend the extension of existing restrictions on mass gatherings and the closure of schools beyond March 29th.On foot of concerns raised by doctors about a shortage of personal protective equipment when treating patients with Covid-19, Mr Reid said the health service had “a good stock overall”.The HSE had a €200 million order in for 11 million masks, 1 million goggles and 400,000 gowns, he said.Aer Lingus is expected to air-freight the consignment from a Chinese warehouse to Ireland shortly. The amount of equipment involved represents 13 years of normal supply.Dr Donal O’Hanlon, president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association wrote to Minister for Health Simon Harris on Friday, saying that doctors across the country were reporting widespread shortages of personal protective equipment. He said stocks were “running out” in some locations, “leaving frontline staff and their patients in extremely exposed positions”.The fourth person to die in the Republic was a male patient in the east of the country. A further 121 new cases were confirmed on Sunday evening, bringing the total to 906.While this is below the 1,300 forecast under the Government’s modelling, this is not regarded as significant because the outbreak is still at an early stage.However, public health doctors carrying out contact tracing are finding that the majority of contacts of confirmed cases are mostly household members, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.This appears to show that, as in China, most people get the disease from a family member rather than in the wider community.Northern Ireland on Sunday recorded a second death, 20 new cases and a total of 128 cases of the disease.Referring to the record 793 deaths recorded in Italy on Saturday, Mr Reid said Ireland can “make it so different” but needed to grasp the opportunity to save lives over the next seven days.Italy last evening had recorded 5,560 new confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 59,138. Total deaths number 5,476.The Department of Education said there was no intention “at this moment” to cancel or postpone the Leaving or Junior Cert exams this summer.Senior Government officials are due to meet today to discuss proposals for providing childcare for essential healthcare workers during the coming months.All McDonald’s restaurants in the UK and Ireland will close by 7pm on Monday at the latest to protect the safety of their employees and customers, the company said last night.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209739.1584959128!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk embarked on foolish experiment in approach to coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gabriel Scally, president of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, has said it was deeply disturbing that the British government was “flying blind” and embarking on “a foolish experiment” in its approach to coronavirus.Dr Gabriel Scally, president of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, has said it was deeply disturbing that the British government was “flying blind” and embarking on “a foolish experiment” in its approach to coronavirus.The British government must get ahead of the curve and at present it was “trailing far behind,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.There is no reason why the UK had departed from accepted international practice and advice about coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, and that of the World Health Organisation, he said.Dr Scally said there had been considerable delay in implementing effective social distancing measures in the UK and that the crowds seen at Glendalough last weekend were “nothing” compared to the crowds seen at flower markets in London.WuhanAll the reports coming from London showed that a situation like Wuhan, where a six-week lockdown was implemented, looked very likely to happen, he warned.The UK has 5,683 cases of the virus and the death toll has reached 281.Dr Scally said the fight must be taken to the virus and it cannot be allowed spread like wildfire across the country.On Monday, the UK goverment sent in the army to deliver protective equipment to hospitals on Monday and told people to stay at home and heed warnings over social distancing or the government would bring in more extreme measures to stop the coronavirus spread.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"But veterinary authorities say there is no evidence of animal to human transmissionPresident of High Court says information must be provided to HSEWoman on night duty in nursing home was meant to be checking on resident regularlyWoman got in car believing Boakye Osei (30) and Kelvin Opoku (33) would take her homeDeputy First Minister Michelle O\u0026rsquoNeill close to tears when taking question on virus emergencyBray-Greystones cliff walk is latest amenity to close after Glendalough car parks were shut downVaradkar says further restrictions will only be implemented based on expert adviceOnline courses are also available on the National Adult Literacy Agency websiteAdult volunteers to assist in community support effort of pensioners and the vulnerableIt is understood the dogs were owned by the Dublin boy\u0026rsquos familyIncome support to help employers keep people in work to be announcedTaoiseach\u0026rsquos comments about hair salons at odds with social distancing, industry claimsDetectives hope to establish if incident is linked to existing feuds in the cityGovernment must \u0026lsquodramatically increase delivery of social housing\u0026rsquo, says Eoin \u0026Oacute BroinStruggling companies will be dealt with \u0026lsquosympathetically\u0026rsquo , says head of financePSNI also warns against \u0026lsquoscammers\u0026rsquo who take money from vulnerable to buy groceries but never deliverSt Patrick\u0026rsquos Day city centre numbers down 72 per cent on last yearFish-and-chips chain says it attempted to ensure social distancing on SundayStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209237.1584894703!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"about 40 000 people waiting up to five days for a test","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRichard Quinlan, chief ambulance officer for north Leinster and advanced paramedic, with a  Covid-19 testing kit. Photograph: Alan Betson  The There are now about 40,000 people in Ireland waiting for a test for the coronavirus, the HSE has said.At a briefing on Sunday the HSE’s chief operations officer, Anne O’Connor, said the average waiting period for a test was four to five days.However, she said the HSE had accelerated the provision of testing sites and was looking to reduce the waiting period over coming days. There are 35 testing sites but by Tuesday this is expected to rise to 41. The largest of these, at Cork’s Páirc Uí Chaoimh where 1,000 tests a day could be provided, opened on Sunday. The LE Samuel Beckett navy vessel is now also being used as a testing site in Dublin. In total, the HSE is looking at providing up to 50 testing centres across the State. About 13,000 people have already been tested for the coronavirus. Overall, Ms O’Connor said there were now 177 people in hospital with Covid-19. She said this had increased from 151 on Saturday morning. There are 29 people in intensive care units. There was capacity in the hospital system to deal with growing numbers of patients with Covid-19, she added, with 2,243 vacant beds at present including 173 ICU beds.On foot of concerns raised by doctors about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for use when dealing with patients with Covid-19, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the health service had “a good stock overall”.He said in the past week or so in some particular areas and hospitals “things ran tighter” than in others and “we have been looking at some re-distribution”.“We have been working in a very difficult market and have been securing significant orders, including one for more than €200 million in China. ”He said orders for PPE would include 11 million masks, one million goggles, 400,000 gowns and suits.Supplies of new PPE would be air freighted to Ireland, the HSE chief said.Private sectorMr Reid said the HSE was working with the private hospital sector and, overall, there would now be a capacity of about 500 intensive care beds.He said procurement of ventilators was continuing. “We’ve already secured 300 and a further 1,000 will be delivered over the coming weeks.”The pandemic would place the Irish health service under stress “like we’ve never known before” over the coming weeks, he added. The scale of the problem would put the regular winter overcrowding experienced in Irish hospitals “into context”. However, he said the health service was planning for what was to come.The HSE is looking to establish 10,000 extra beds including field hospitals where those who are less acutely sick can be cared for without visiting a hospital.Specialist in public health medicine Dr Sarah Doyle said an increase in the level of testing for the coronavirus would inevitably lead to a rise in the number of confirmed cases. She said the health service wanted to find these cases so contact tracing of others who may have been infected could be carried out.Mr Reid said the scale of contact tracing would increase significantly with more than 1,000 people involved in the process shortly.Dr Doyle said the chances of someone contracting the Covid-19 virus were still low but this was increasing.She said there were no plans to introduce testing for people who had no symptoms or randomised testing.Asked about reports of a cluster of positive cases at a nursing home, the HSE said outbreaks of infectious diseases in nursing homes were not uncommon and staff were used to dealing with this issue. However, the scale and numbers would be extremely challenging.The HSE has asked the media not to identify any nursing homes concerned.Meanwhile, the HSE has begun interviewing some of the 50,000 people who put their names forward to work in the health service to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. It said about 1,500 nurses had said they were currently not working in the Irish health system and they were the priority (to recruit) as were the 1,000 doctors who had volunteered including 200 not currently in the Irish system.It said about 400 ambulance personnel had put their names forward too.

Absolutely disgraceful. And then we wonder why people are getting sick.”Beshoff Bros general manager Bridget Starbuck said staff in its Howth premises had attempted to introduce social distancing measures by letting only one person at a time into the shop.“The amount of abuse we have been getting since last night has been disheartening,” she told The .“It’s incredibly difficult because the staff did not want to go out and talk to people who were shouting abuse back.“We had marked the areas where people had to stand. They had to stand behind yellow lines. If I look at our own cameras, people were keeping their distances.“I don’t think we should be targeted. I don’t think it is right when the beaches and everything else was full.”Ms Starbuck added: “We never saw a sign of one single guard yesterday at all. There was no sign. Why didn’t they close Howth off if Howth was so busy?”Ms Starbuck said that if the Government wanted takeaways such as theirs to close down, it should say so. However: “It is not fair if we close and other people are open.”In a statement on its social media accounts issued on Monday morning, Beshoff Bros said it has been an “incredibly difficult time for all of our staff”.“We wanted to thank all of our staff who have been working hard to try and provide for our local communities and we’d like to thank our customers for their support during this difficult time.“We hope that everyone stays safe and healthy and we hope to open our doors to you all very soon.”Customers will instead be able to order for delivery through Uber Eats or beshoffbros.orderyoyo.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4209868.1584972456!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus beauty industry says government advice is unworkable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe hair and beauty industry has called for an urgent clarification from the Government about its status due to the coronavirus. The hair and beauty industry has called for an urgent clarification from the Government about its status due to the coronavirus.The newly formed Hair and Beauty Industry Confederation (HABIC) and other representative groups in the industry have written a letter to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling on him to clarify remarks he made last week.In comments made last week the Taoiseach stated it would be “counterproductive to shut restaurants and hairdressers and send people home to interact in the same way”.The industry employs almost 26,000 people mostly women operating in small businesses in the Republic.HABIC chief executive Margaret O’Rourke Doherty said the seemingly contradictory advice for hair salons to stay open, yet for the public to maintain social distancing was “completely unworkable”.She explained: “There is no physical way of keeping a social distance. There is no way you can do a client from six feet. There’s a contradiction there and we need clarity.”The letter pointed out that there has been no specific advice to hair and beauty salons to shut and yet it would be impossible for such salons to operate.The letter added: “As a collective of industry organisations, we do not believe that our industry at this point can meet the current requirements set out by the HSE.“Following your statement, we are seeking leadership and guidance from Government. As an industry collective, we are seeking a clear and comprehensive recommendation from public health professionals and the Irish government as to the continuance of trading within the Irish hair, beauty and spa sectors.”The letter is also signed by the Irish Hairdressers Federation president David Campbell, Hairdressing Council of Ireland president Sean Taaffe, Irish Spa Association chairperson Anita Murray and Synergy Hair Group chairperson Catherine Finn.ClosuresThe industry stated that the closures are coming on the back of a difficult 2019 when the numbers employed decreased by 8 per cent due to the reversal of the VAT rate, abolishment of the trainee rate and the increase in national minimum wages.“We say this in a time of crisis as these businesses are the backbone of Ireland’s towns and villages, providing essential services, and employment. They deserve your full support.”The industry called for direct grant payments to salons to ensure liquidity for organisations at the threat of going bust, the reinstatement of the statutory redundancy rebate and the reduction of the VAT rate to 9 per cent.Mrs O’Rourke Doherty said the state of the industry was “heartbreaking” at present with many businesses already closed.“The vast majority of salons have taken it upon themselves to close. You are also finding pressure from society as well for them to close,” she added.“There are still some definitely open and they are waiting for guidance. Many of them that will close will not know when to open.

Photograph: Aidan Crawley Scouting Ireland is preparing for its adult volunteers to assist in the State’s plan to “cocoon” elderly and vulnerable people in their homes to protect them from the coronavirus in the coming weeks.The youth organisation has more than 50,000 members, including 12,000 adult volunteers. It plans to assist in the national response to the coronavirus outbreak following a request from the Government, the chair of the organisation’s board Adrian Tennant said on Monday. Mr Tennant said a task force was being set up between key elected volunteers, staff and board members, to plan how the organisation can help during the coronavirus outbreak. It is envisaged adult leaders and older “rover scout” members, who are between 18 and 25 years of age, would be asked to assist in supporting vulnerable members of their communities during the public health crisis. The plan is “when the cocooning phase comes in that we are ready to assist the State agencies in what way we can”, said Mr Tennant. This could include bringing food supplies and shopping to the elderly and vulnerable, collecting medical prescriptions, or making regular phone calls to check in on iniduals, he said. In a televised address last week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the country would attempt to “cocoon” those most at risk from the virus by having them remain in their homes in the coming weeks, where they would be supplied with essentials. Mobilising locallyMr Tennant said juvenile members would also be asked to help from their homes, for example by corresponding with nursing home residents.“We have seen call outs from nursing homes, where family members can no longer visit residents, or people may not have anyone to visit them,” he said. Mr Tennant said the “hands on stuff” would not be undertaken by Scouting Ireland members under 18 years of age. “Our main priority is the safety of our members and their families . . . In terms of safeguarding, we won’t be putting our young people in harm’s way,” he said. The organisation plans to begin volunteering efforts to assist elderly and vulnerable people locally, to be in a position to ramp up its operation in the event that the Government enacted its “cocooning phase”, he said. The youth organisation has cancelled all local scout meetings and events until at least the end of the month, following the two-week closure of schools, colleges and other institutions. And it has also postponed large camping trips and several national events which were due to take place in April.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210083.1584981426!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il calls for more detail on coronavirus clusters","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                             Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on the Dáil plinth on Monday  afternoon.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw  The Mr Martin, speaking ahead of a meeting of all party leaders on the crisis, also called for further restrictions on the movement of people but did not call for a full national lockdown. Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald, also speaking to reporters ahead of the leaders’ meeting, called on Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to close all non-essential business.Mr Varadkar has indicated he will not do so and the Government says any decisions will be taken on foot of advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan. Mr Martin said rumours of the locations of outbreaks are counterproductive to “good behaviour”. While he said that regional restrictions on movement could be put in place, he said greater transparency is more likely to encourage people to change their behaviour if they know there is a cluster in their area.He said “severe restrictions are required in terms of public gatherings”, adding: “It’s all about protecting our senior citizens, protecting people with underlying conditions.” Mr Martin also called for a strong programme of income supports similar to that introduced in Denmark, where the State pays up to 75 per cent of person’s salary to a certain limit, and in the UK, where the payment is up to 80 per cent of salary, again to a limit. “Substantive supports for employees, people who’ve been laid off in particular sectors and in line with other countries, but also maintaining the link between the worker and the enterprise,” he said. “ Because I think that is the key so that the enterprise, when this is over, can restart as quickly as possible. And for that to happen, there will have to be softer loans, interest free loans and working capital supports.” The Government is expected to finalise the details of a package of supports in the coming days.Time delays Mr Martin raised concerns about the time it is taking to carry out coronavirus tests as well as “anxiety” about personal protective equipment for medical staff.“We know that the HSE has put in significant orders. But there needs to be straight up transparency and honesty with staff and with people across the country in relation to that issue.”Ms McDonald said it is “obvious now at this stage that we’re at the point where the emergency measures to protect people need to be stepped up very significantly”. She said it is “intolerable” and “unacceptable” that some people are in workplaces where physical distancing cannot be adequately practiced.“It’s unacceptable that working people are being left with so much risk. People that work on construction sites, in factories, in call centers…know that when they go to work, that they’re not safe because it’s simply not possible, in so many cases, to practice safe physical distancing. “Delay costs lives. That’s the lesson from other countries. We should not drag our heels now. ”She said while this could lead to “hundreds of thousands of temporary redundancies” an “adequate income support scheme” should be put in place. Mr Varadkar earlier called a suggestion from Ms McDonald that the money from the Apple tax case be used for such supports “rubbish”.“Mary Lou McDonald should know better,” he said. “The Apple money is in an escrow account and that’s where it’s being held until the European courts decide where that money’s going to go.”Ms McDonald said: “I’m not interested in having a squabble with him as to where the money is raised. It’s going to be an expensive scheme, but it’s absolutely necessary.”The Government has been criticised for its financial support commitments to employers and employees adversely affected by the Covid-19 emergency, which is below the average of the packages that have been offered by other EU governments. The €203 payment announced earlier this month for those who have lost their jobs has come in for particular criticism as being far too low.Mr Varadkar said on Monday the Government had been working on an income support package over the weekend and would hopefully be in a position to conclude it over the next 24 hours.“There are really two aspects of what we need to do. One is an enhanced payment for people who’ve lost their jobs, and the other is payments for employers to encourage them to keep people on their payroll.“So as you know, for somebody who’s lost their job. They get a minimum now €203 a week, as compared to only £100 a week in Northern Ireland, or the UK, but we think that’s too low, given the circumstances, and we need to hold our society together.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210095.1584983040!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pet owners advised to practise social distancing with animals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA spokeswoman for the ISPCA said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread  coronavirus. File photograph: Fran VealePet owners should make relatively small adjustments to the routines of their animals, but there is no need to be alarmist or abandon dogs, according to vets and other medical authorities. Bray, Co Wicklow-based vet Pete Wedderburn said “dogs and cats cannot get coronavirus, but you should keep your dog two metres from other dogs and humans if you are out for a walk”, he said. In addition to not getting the virus, Mr Wedderburn said dogs could not transmit it to humans, in an aerosol fashion, through droplets. But he said social distancing should be extended to pets just in case a pet comes into contact with the virus through, for example, somebody sneezing on it. “Like any other surface, a dog’s coat can carry viruses back to a human, so there has to be a little isolation involved,” he explained. “Shampoo will keep a dog clean and will kill any viruses.” “If your cat is the kind that likes to visit two or three other homes during the day, think about keeping him indoors,” he said.Veterinary Ireland, the profession’s national representative organisation, said veterinary practices would endeavour to remain open throughout the Covid-19 crisis, but clients must phone first for an appointment. Those in isolation should not allow others to touch their pets, the organisation said.Dundrum pet food supplier Shane Walsh of Breffini House Pets said owners were making an effort “to do the best for their pets”. He said owners had been making sure they had enough supplies, “but not stockpiling”. Mr Walsh said there was “no shortage”.No evidenceThe ISPCA national animal centre in Longford and the DSPCA centre in Rathfarnham have closed to the public but animals are still being cared for at both centres. A spokeswoman for the ISPCA said there was no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats could spread coronavirus. “According to experts, Covid-19 cannot be transmitted from human to animal or vice versa. If your pet is touched by someone with coronavirus, then there is the potential that it can be spread, should someone else come into contact with your pet but the risk of this is extremely low,” spokeswoman Carmel Murray said. “We are asking pet owners not to worry about their pets,” she said. “It is important to interact with your pets as normal and to wash your hands regularly after contact with any animal.” The World Health Organisation has also reiterated there is no evidence that pets such as the family dog or cat can spread coronavirus to humans. It was commenting after publicity surrounding the Hong Kong dog which produced a “weak positive” in a test for coronavirus. The journal Science, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the Pomeranian dog based in Hong Kong was found to have shown a “weak positive” in a test for the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease Covid-19. However, WHO said coronavirus was transmitted primarily through droplets expelled during coughing and sneezing or a discharge from saliva and the nose. While pets were well known for their affectionate licks and runny noses, even sneezes, there were no known cases of such a transfer happening, the WHO said.ISPCA tips and adviceWhen out walking your dog, you should ensure they are kept on a short lead and under control at all times. Restrict contact with other people and animals and adhere to social distancing guidelines.Continue to exercise and play with your pets to alleviate stress in the confines of your garden.There are plenty of ways to keep your pets entertained such as putting their favourite treats in a Kong pet toy, using food puzzle toys, playing fetch or tug-of-war with their favourite toy.This is a good time to teach your pets some new tricks. The ISPCA would love to see your cute animal photos or videos.Avoid sharing your food or being kissed or licked by your pet and always wash your hands. It’s important you have sufficient pet food, prescribed medication or other essentials such as cat litter during self-isolation. Plan ahead in the event you need help caring for your pets short or long term.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: EPA As people across China take tentative steps towards a new normality after two months of national trauma, the world they assess has been reshaped. Entering a state of flux, relationships are changing.For some, this relationship change involves ending marriages – registry offices around the country have been inundated with orce applications.The unprecedented levels, an official said, were a result of stress from families being house bound for so long. Fear of virus spread, and related financial woes, were helping to “evoke any underlying marital conflicts”.Schisms may appear on a wider level, too. Long the epitome of globalisation – trading, travelling and studying all around the globe – Chinese are, for now at least, being forced to think local.“Why is Trump such a racist? Why does he want to isolate China?” a retired university professor asked me as we admired the blooming cherry blossoms in Beijing’s Chaoyang park.Like other Chinese I have spoken to, he ridiculed the conspiracy theories being advanced by some Beijing officials that the virus originated in the US, not in Wuhan. “Preposterous, just a distraction,” he laughed. “But Trump is just looking for a distraction too, or a scapegoat.”His take – a fairly common one here – is that the Chinese party-state really did fumble the ball early on, but then went a long way to making amends with an all-out effort to curtail the pathogen’s spread.The ensuing “mask diplomacy” efforts, where China is sending supplies and expertise to stricken nations, “makes me feel proud again”, he said.Donald Trump now demonising China and placing ordinary Chinese in danger was an irresponsible response, he felt. His own nephew is in university in the US, and now lives in fear of verbal or physical abuse. His parents want him to drop out of college and come home.He spoke of a new cold war, “and that won’t help anybody”.A businessman who has been exporting to the US and Europe was also angry at international criticism of China. “Would they have handled it better if the disease started in their countries? A new virus – so hard to deal with,” he said. “It looks like a mess over there too.”With supply chains disintegrating and international markets in disarray, he said more Chinese companies would now be focusing on the domestic consumer. “It’s risky betting on international business these days,” he said.Miranda had been hoping to do a master’s degree abroad, ideally in Ireland, the UK or the US. Now in a coronavirus world, however, she feels her realistic options in the near term are Beijing or Shanghai.“It’s like the world got smaller. Things are different now,” she said.The Chinese people’s relationship with their own leaders is also slowly shifting, said the professor. The party’s grip is still tight, but he feels they must be more responsive these days. He shows me a letter on his phone that has been circulating widely online – despite the censors’ best efforts – by Zhao Shilin, a former member of the party’s central committee.“All negative events, including both natural and man-made disasters, are seen as threats to stability . . . a kind of rule has formed which holds that if any negative event can be handled in a low-profile fashion, then it should be,” he wrote in the letter to Chinese president Xi Jinping. “And so, the focus on this so-called stability is on the safety of the political regime, rather than the wellbeing of the people.”The retired political leader wrote two long letters to Xi, dissecting the party’s handling of the crisis and concluding that “if preventative measures had been taken in a timely manner in December or January, the epidemic would be much smaller. As we recover . . . instead of propagandising our system’s great strength, we should instead look to fix the broken boards.”An aborted political campaign also casts light on the evolving nature of interactions between citizens and state.When Wuhan party secretary Wang Zhonglin felt recently the citizens at ground zero were not showing sufficient appreciation for chairman Xi’s leadership, he launched a “gratitude education” campaign that asked the people of Wuhan, who have been under lockdown for more than 60 days, to find ways to show thanks to the chairman and the party.The suggestion triggered a furious reaction from the public online, an unusual occurrence in a system that does not welcome dissent. In the face of widespread outrage, officials had to delete tens of thousands of scathing comments and the campaign was quietly shelved.The people had spoken.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson to address the nation as NHS announces 46 more deathsSalmond - the comeback king of Scottish politicsGovernment rolls out rail rescue package for coronavirus-hit servicesMonday evening news briefing: Boris Johnson expected to extend lockdownNew York governor forced to crowdsource masks and ventilators for struggling hospitals on TwitterComment: We cannot let coronavirus put democracy on holdMilk deliveries return to fashion as Britain works from home in coronavirus crisisWhere in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?From Tom Hanks and Harvey Weinstein to Michel Barnier, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansCoronavirus deaths rising faster in UK than ItalyCoronavirus testing: how many people are being tested in the UK - and how does it compare to other countries? London lockdown: Are shops closed, is the Tube running and can I leave the house? Who is on the list of key workers?

The non-binary singer who insists on gender-neutral pronouns (“Theythem”) posted a video clip of themselves having what my dad would have called “the ab-dabs” on social media this week. Having selflessly entered self-isolation at their £12 million home on Thursday, by Friday they were weeping like a girl (sorry, like an assigned at birth cis female) because they were already bored with their own company.“I hate reading!”, they confessed, suggesting that if you have no life of the mind you’ll always be a bad friend to yourself – even if you do refer yourself in the plural.But it could be worse Smith could have joined the other celebrities treating us to their own stardust-sprinkled version of the ghastly John Lennon song Imagine.I’ve had “issues” with this song forever, summing up perfectly as it does Lennon’s weapons-grade hypocrisy. While encouraging the hoi polloi to “imagine no possessions”, he and his consort kept a whole apartment in the Dakota building where they lived in New York for the exclusive occupation of their fur coats, just to keep them at the right temperature.Elton John nailed it in his autobiography: “The various apartments the Lennons owned … were so full of priceless artworks, antiques and clothes that I once sent them a card, rewriting the lyrics to Imagine: Imagine six apartments, it isn’t hard to do, one is full of fur coats, another’s full of shoes.’’In fact, Lennon was forever ready to take his non-specific rage out on someone, provided, of course, that person was powerless. In his actions – as opposed to his statements and his songs – he exhibited largely selfishness and spite. To be fair, the new Imagineers aren’t in the same camp as Lennon. They’re lovely to look at (Wonder Women from Lynda Carter to Gal Gadot, actresses Natalie Portman and Cara Delevingne) and extremely accomplished (songwriter Sia, singer Norah Jones, comic Will Ferrell) and they mean well.But scratch a showboating altruist and you’ll often find an attention whore I know, because I’m one. I get to show off in print and I’m good at it, but performers in other areas can’t do their thing alone. It’s driving them nuts that no one’s looking at them, hence Michele Pfeiffer posted a video of herself working out while Bob Geldof rang up a TV show to announce his own self-isolation.It’s touching to look at celebrities and see how unconscious they are of their vulnerability George Michael, who knew about these things, once defined a star as “someone with a little something missing rather than a little something extra”.They need their fans – but their fans do not need them although they may momentarily enjoy their singing voices or good looks. When the famous attempt to parlay this passing fancy into actual power, it falls flat each time a celebrity urged people not to vote for Trump or Brexit, it seems they caused another thousand to do so.And they will be heeded less than ever as we plunge deeper into the plague year. Gadot said that she had been inspired by the Italian videos of neighbours singing to each other on their balconies ironically it’s this development that shows how superfluous stars are.Transcendence was just around the corner all along – and we don’t need to pay for it. Like the tree falling in the metaphorical forest, when a star smiles and no “civilian” watches, does the star still feel happiness?I’m sure we will see much more of them getting their flashing-fix in the guise of giving something to the Little People before we’re out from under lockdown.But eventually even these most unrealistic of beings will realise that the achievements of the rich and famous count for nothing in a new world in which those who do the most arduous and thankless labour are – at long last – the most honoured. We will look back in wonder that we once called dress designers ‘visionaries’ and disc jockeys ‘superstars.’At a time singularly short of silver linings, this must be one.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Soft-boiled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs – and where in the whole of London we could find the city’s last carton of precious, best-laid eggs.“Got any eggs?” were my husband’s first words when he rang his parents yesterday. Not an egg to be had in all of Berkshire. Two girlfriends, one pregnant, one breastfeeding, both depleted, tell of kind neighbours leaving bubble-wrapped eggs on the doorstep.I am kicking myself for not buying the only option left on the shelves in Waitrose on Friday: a single packet of quail’s eggs. It felt a bit Marie Antoinette-ish in the face of a global pandemic. My editor reports a similar dilemma faced by her uncle at Portobello Market: duck eggs or bust. On Saturday morning, after a fruitless – or should that be yolkless? – search of six shops, I came home with a bottle of Fairy Liquid and a bunch of hyacinths. Very cheering, but not much cop on toast. Hen’s eggs have become as rare as hen’s teeth.Who bought all the eggs? Who on Sunday morning sat down to a five-egg frittata? Who is broodily clucking over their hoard while the rest of us go without?I’m still horrified by a conversation three years ago with my driving instructor about his diet. Each morning, he boiled six eggs, cut them in half, scooped out and threw away the yolks, and ate the whites. It was appalling then, unforgivable now.After a week without omelettes, some are panic-buying bantams. (Insert joke about headless chickens here.) Poultry breeders report soaring sales. Rosehill Hatchery in Hanningfield, Essex, sold 300 hens in just two days. On Thursday, it shut up coop. Sales of the “Eglu” – a chicken igloo – are up 66 per cent in Europe and the US. Looking out at the fire escape, six floors up in central London, I wonder whether it is practical to recreate The Good Life in Paddington. Perhaps not.May the nation’s Leghorns, Orpingtons and Lincolnshire Buffs rise to the occasion. Girls, get laying! Your country urgently, hungrily needs you.Talking of girls cooped up together, the BBC is to bring forward its adaptation of Enid Blyton’s Malory Towers boarding school books to entertain children starting what promises to be a very long Easter holiday. Raise your lacrosse sticks in a sabre arch, here come Darrell, Sally, Alicia, Gwendoline, Mary-Lou and Mam’zelle Dupont the French mistress.Raise your lacrosse sticks in a sabre arch: here come the Malory Towers girlsThe BBC is billing the series as a tale of female empowerment (golly) and not, as I had hitherto thought, an innocent celebration of bagsied desks, beastly tricks, dormy games and saggy swimsuits. What would the BBC producers think of my childhood spent playing First Term At Mallory Towers with pneumatic Barbie dolls cast as the “feminist role models” Darrell, Sally and Mary-Lou? (I wasn’t the wokest of six-year-olds.)Still, the resolute jolliness of the North Tower girls could prove an inspiration in these anxious times. Anyone caught moping about loo roll, cancelled flights or cabin fever should be silenced with a rousing: “Cheer up, Gwendoline!” And all stockpilers are to be immediately punished with lashings of extra prep.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

At once a deeply heart-rending and unexpectedly uplifting moment in these extraordinary times. The poignant absence of the nation’s mothers was the central focus.But the human, humane response from their children served as a tribute to Britain’s ingenuity and good humour, even in the grip of a deadly pandemic. Some spoke on the phone or waved through windows to their mums. Others harnessed modern technology and FaceTimed from their front rooms or went back to basics and asked their local radio station for a special dedication.Across the UK, families strove to find novel ways to spread good cheer rather than the coronavirus.On social media, David Kenworthy made light of stockpiling by tweeting “Best Mother’s Day gift ever. No 1 son” beside a screenshot of Andrex loo roll.Elsewhere, two sisters arrived at their mum’s house with a bouquet in full protective gear, including masks.A middle-aged woman was filmed several metres away from her elderly mother and holding up handwritten signs by way of homage to the scene in Love Actually some were brought to tears by the tenderness of the messages.Celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Amanda Holden, Piers Morgan and Ant and Dec went online to post throwback photographs of themselves with their mothers “in happier times”.And then there were snapshots of beaming children standing outside grandmothers’ houses and adults amiably drinking tea separated from their pensioner parent by the glass wall of the conservatory.Jennifer Grover, 84, a retired housewife and health worker from Sutton in Surrey, was “visited” by three of her 17 grandchildren via Skype. “We used it this morning for half an hour and that was lovely,” she said. “It was a new and very different experience.“It’s just because they haven’t been able to see me in person and it was the next best thing.”But despite the inventiveness and the smiles, Mothering Sunday has given us all pause for thought.Who could have imagined just six months ago that the simple act of visiting our own mothers would become a life or death decision?The coronavirus has changed the world. Changed us.On Sunday, as the Prime Minister urged the nation to stay indoors, and medical experts begged us to keep the elderly and the infirm safe, a generation of mothers sat home alone.There were no joyful family gatherings. No hand-delivered chocolates from prodigal sons. No fierce hugs and beribboned gifts from daughters. No inky home-made cards and fairy cakes from grandchildren.It was for their own good. Our own good. Society’s own good. That did not make it easy to bear.As James Mitchinson, editor of The Yorkshire Post, tweeted to his readers: “This #MothersDay you can give your mum something quite special. A few more years of life on this planet to enjoy their retirements, their grandchildren, the simple things.“Please don’t put them in grave danger for the sake of sentiment.”In London, Kensington Palace shared a message from Heads Together, their mental health charity, which asked people to get in touch with those who found Mother’s Day difficult, including those who have lost their mothers, their own children or could not be with them.It was a reminder that despite social distancing, we can – must – continue to connect in other ways. Sunday offered the perfect opportunity.Unlike Valentine’s Day with its exploitative blizzard of hearts and orchestrated schmaltz, the promotion of Mothering Sunday has always felt entirely benign.It represents a welcome nudge to remember the incredible, selfless women who birthed us, reared us and made us who we are. Some of us discover that we had no real inkling of how much, how unconditionally, our mothers loved us until we had children of our own.And so Mother’s Day has evolved into a unique and uniquely intimate date in the calendar. A harbinger of spring, it is reverently set aside for quiet joy green-tipped bulbs pushing through the dark earth of Marks \u0026amp Spencer planters, glasses of generic fizz (mothers invariably cavil at the extravagance of champagne) or a stroll around a National Trust property.Coronavirus UK and regional map ..Not this year. Stately piles are closed. The shops are deserted, restaurants have brought the shutters down in a bid to kill off Covid-19 before it wipes out a generation.With inventiveness and determination a great many of us joyfully marked Mother’s Day.But the bleak reality is that the risk we – any one of us – pose to our parents extends far beyond this one day. It reaches into tomorrow, next week, next month.If we can’t visit our mothers on Mother’s Day, when can we? That is the harrowing question nobody dares ask because nobody can answer.   The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Later.There are concerns that an increase in the number people travelling to rural communities, which already have a high proportion of elderly residents, will put unsustainable pressure on local health and social care services, as well as shops.Some rural communities have warned that people are attempting to isolate themselves in remote areas amid petitions for caravan parks to be closed.Judy Murray, the mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie Murray, tweeted a simple message to those relocating to the countryside – a picture of a car and trailer with Go home idiots and Covid-19 painted on the side. Other social media users shared pictures and videos of packed parks and car parks and described people as covidiots.Boris Johnson said the Government would be thinking very actively in the next 24 hours about taking further measures to prevent the ignoring of social distancing advice.He told a press conference on Sunday that I don\u0027t want to do that as it is so important that people are able to go out, but stressed that freedom can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing.The Prime Minister added that if people can\u0027t make use of parks and playgrounds in a way that observes two-metre rule, then we\u0027re going to have to look at further measures.The National Trust said on Sunday that it would close all parks, gardens, houses, shops and cafes as well as car parks for countryside and coastal locations because of high demand.Director general Hilary McGrady said the trust would be taking measures to ensure that people do not lose their connection with nature, and that the sites of natural beauty remain open virtually.Snowdonia National Park Authority said its area experienced its busiest visitor day in living memory on Saturday, with so many people that it was impossible to maintain effective social distancing.Chatsworth House, Whipsnade Zoo and the Yorkshire Wildlife Park also announced that they would be closing their doors, and some DIY stores and garden centres reported being busier than on Bank Holiday weekends, when visitor numbers are normally at their peak.Britain is not the first country to see a rush to beauty spots, with visitor destinations across the world being overwhelmed. The Australian government this weekend closed Bondi Beach in Sydney because of overcrowding.But it was not just rural areas and beauty spots that experienced high numbers of visitors. Londoners were criticised for attending packed markets, including the famous flower market on Colombia Road.Hammersmith and Fulham council announced that, as of 7pm on Sunday night,  all the parks in the borough would be closed until further notice, adding: Please stay home, save lives.Royal Parks closed its parks on the outskirts of London to all traffic, and all remaining takeway cafes and kiosks, because people are not adhering to social distancing guidelines.A spokesman warned that it was keeping the situation under review and, if the rules continue to be ignored, will have no choice but to consider closing the parks.Many are concerned that, with London the worst hit and with schools shut, the situation in the countryside will get worse unless action is taken.Kate Forbes, the SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, said there has been an influx of campervans and traffic with people living in cities to what they think is self-isolation. But this is not a wilderness, this is a place where people live.George Freeman, the MP for Mid Norfolk, tweeted: To those people with 2nd homes in Norfolk: PLS DONT flee London to come to Norfolk, adding that they risked spreading the virus.On Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon moved to stem a flood of people into the Highlands by barring them from taking ferries to the islands and telling all accommodation providers to stop accepting visitors.The First Minister said all hotels, bed and breakfasts and self-catering providers should only be housing staff and essential workers amid fears local rural hospitals could collapse under the pressure.The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, warned: Social distancing includes avoiding all but essential travel, and if people don\u0027t follow this advice we will have no choice but to use powers to enforce it.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus tests uk testing how many people tested compared countries","story":"More than 70,000 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, and fresh efforts are being made to widen the net.It comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) insisted that members who are battling the virus have to scale up their response to the crisis.When Covid-19 first reached Britain’s shores, fewer than 100 tests a day were being carried out, leaving the country lagging behind its neighbours in detection rates.Boris Johnson has confirmed that the number of Covid-19 tests carried out in the UK would reach 25,000 a day, signalling a drastic departure from current testing levels.Public Health England has previously said it has the capacity for 4,000 tests a day, but the health service has struggled to top 2,000 a day on average.On March 11 NHS England announced it would be scaling this up to 10,000 a day, calling on local hospital labs to help with the effort.To date that figure has not yet been reached, with the most Covid-19 tests carried out in a single day to date on Thursday, March 19, with 8,400 new tests.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus this week criticised countries which have not tested enough, telling them: you cannot fight a fire blindfolded... test, test, test.The government\u0027s response comes as chief scientific advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said there needed to be a big increase in testing.Despite the capacity for 4,000 tests a day, less than half that number were being used until the number of confirmed cases in the UK passed 500 – on March 12.Testing was previously limited only to those who had returned from an affected country or had been in contact with a known case.The number of tests being rolled out in the UK is increasing - but slowly. On March 19 testing exceeded 8,000 a day for the first time.Since then the number has fallen back to between 5,000 and 6,000 a day.Who can get tested?As the UK moved from the \u0027contain\u0027 to \u0027delay\u0027 phase of its response to the virus, the criteria for testing narrowed to only the most severe cases.Public Health England said it needed to prioritise testing for those most at risk of severe illness from the virus, and recommended that people in the community exhibiting symptoms do not usually need testing.Instead, tests will primarily be given to:It is not yet clear whether the criteria will loosen as testing capacity increases, but there have been calls for frontline NHS staff to take priority.Currently, advice is for anyone with a high temperature or new, continuous cough should stay at home for 7 days. People do not need to call NHS 111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.Sir Patrick told the Commons health select committee this week the UK was one of the top three or four countries in terms of testing.The number of people who have now been tested for the disease passed 60,000 on March 19.Based on the latest data from March 20, per head, this is still lower than countries including Denmark and Austria, which have much smaller populations.The UK tested fewer than 1,000 people per million of the population (64,621), while Austria tested more than 1,700 per million (15,613), and Denmark tested almost 1,800 per million (10,402). Even Italy, however, has not seen the level of Covid-19 testing rolled out in some Asian countries.South Korea  tested almost 300,000 people – equivalent to 5,700 tests per million population. In Europe only Norway tested more of the population with more than 6,000 per million (34,583 tests).But the number of tests administered does not necessarily lead to an increase in detected cases.Accuracy of testing is equally important.Bahrain, with a population of just 1.5 million,  tested 8,600 people per million. Only one per cent came back positive. One in five Italians given the Covid-19 test came back positive up to March 20.There is no specific treatment, although doctors are trialling existing drugs for viruses such as Ebola and HIV. Early results seem promising but, until full clinical trials have been concluded, doctors cannot be certain that the drugs are effective. Work to develop a vaccine is accelerating, but this work has been complicated by the virus mutating into a second strain.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"experts join forces determine age cerne abbas giant","story":"Archaeologists have launched a mission to determine the age of the mysterious Cerne Abbas Giant for the first time.The giant hill figure of a standing nude man brandishing a giant club measures 55-metres (180ft) and overlooks the village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset.The origins and purpose of Britain\u0027s largest and perhaps best-known chalk hill figure are shrouded in mystery.Theories range from an ancient spirituality symbol or likeness of Greco-Roman hero Hercules to a caricature of Oliver Cromwell, with the club a reference to repressive rule and the phallus a mockery of his puritanism.Local folklore has long held it to be a fertility aid and the earliest recorded mention of the giant dates from 1694.The giant chalk figure was gifted to the National Trust in 1920 by the Pitt-Rivers family. Now the charity, together with the University of Gloucestershire, is undertaking tests to establish the giant\u0027s age.Archaeologists have excavated small trenches to enable samples of soil to be extracted from points on the giant\u0027s elbows and feet.Over the coming weeks, Professor Phillip Toms, from the University of Gloucestershire, will attempt to date the samples using a technique called optically stimulated luminescence (OSL).Martin Papworth, a senior archaeologist at the National Trust, said: The OSL technique is commonly used to determine when mineral grains in the soil were last exposed to sunlight.It was used to discover the age of the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire in the 1990s, which was found to be nearly 3,000-years-old - even more ancient than we had expected.We\u0027re expecting the results of the tests in July. It is likely that the tests will give us a date range, rather than a specific age, but we hope they will help us better understand, and care for, this famous landmark.Gordon Bishop, chairman of the Cerne Historical Society, said villagers were eagerly awaiting the results.Although there are some who would prefer the giant\u0027s age and origins to remain a mystery, I think the majority would like to know at least whether he is ancient or no more than a few hundred-years-old, he said.Whichever may be the case, he is unique.In separate analysis, environmental archaeologist Mike Allen will analyse soil samples containing the microscopic shells of land snails to learn more about the site\u0027s past.There are 118 species of snails in Britain and many of them are habitat specific, so their preserved shells can help us establish what a landscape was like at a certain time, and to track changes in land use over time, he said.They should help us to discover whether the giant was created on a grazed chalk hillside, or whether people purposely cleared scrub to prepare the land for the figure.Most of the time, the giant chalk figure is fairly low maintenance with  sheep grazing the site in spring and autumn to keep him trim, but it is seeds deposited in the sheeps’ poo that encourages weed growth within his lines. The weeds are sprayed by chief ranger Michael Clarke and his team but there comes a point where the top layer of chalk has to be replaced.Last year, the giant was refreshed for the first time in 11 years. A team of volunteers, led by Mr Clarke, hammered in 17 tonnes of new chalk from Salisbury by hand to counteract weathering and keep the giant visible for miles around.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government coronavirus advice walk friends gp gym","story":"The Government has advised everyone against social contact outside the home and strongly advised against it for people over 70 or those with underlying health conditions. But what does that mean for a host of everyday activities? Here, we interpret the guidelines. Everyone, even the young and healthy, should avoid non-essential public transport and try to avoid rush hour, varying their usual travel times to prevent crowding. This includes buses, trams, commuter trains and national rail services.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has asked rail companies to keep as many services running as possible to provide space for passengers to comply with social distancing requirements, suggesting the Government is not expecting people to stop travelling entirely.Walking outside is safer, but avoid touching railings, buttons at pedestrian crossings etc. If this is unavoidable, wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.There are no restrictions on travelling by car or bike or any other form of personal transport. However, people may want to reconsider car pooling or travelling with multiple passengers. The Government has advised Britons against travelling out of the UK for the next 30 days unless absolutely essential.Everyone should now be working from home unless it is not feasible to do so. For example, goods drivers, delivery and transport workers and those working in the emergency services will still need to carry on their jobs. Face-to-face meetings should be replaced with video calls.Pubs and restaurants have been told to close but the risk from other businesses is likely to be low if they are quiet and if healthy people keep a safe distance and practise good hygiene. The same is likely to apply to visiting the hairdresser, but cutting down on social mixing will undoubtedly prevent spread, so keeping grooming appointments and social excursions to a minimum is essential. Some experts have suggested swapping an afternoon at the pub for a walk outside or a quiet picnic as the weather warms. The Prime Minister has said mass gatherings would no longer be supported by emergency workers.Takeaway food should be a safe option, particularly if delivered, as long as restaurants practise good hygiene. Visiting shops for anything other than essential items is best avoided in the near future.The Church of England has announced that public worship is suspended until further notice. However, church buildings will remain open for prayer where practical and as long as worshippers observe social distancing recommendations.Gyms are among the businesses ordered to keep shut, but keeping fit and healthy is essential during a health crisis, so people should still try to get out and about but stay away from crowded areas. A walk on the beach, a run in the park or a stroll through the countryside is preferable to a city centre, but keeping apart from other people is the main goal.Older people, especially, are advised to make sure they still get fresh air, perhaps by getting into the garden. However, Boris Johnson warned on Sunday that Britain faced a total lockdown within 24 hours amid growing concern at the failure of the public to heed demands for “social distancing” to prevent the coronavirus spreading as huge numbers of people headed to parks or shopping areas and mingled closely.He said the UK could follow France, Italy and Spain where people’s movements have been restricted by police, curfews have been imposed, parks closed and all stores except food shops and pharmacies shut.People should avoid visiting the shops, even to get essentials, if they or a member of their household displays symptoms of coronavirus.The official government advice states: Keep your windows open to let in fresh air, get some natural sunlight if you can, or get outside into the garden. You can also go for a walk or exercise outdoors if you stay more than 2 metres from others.It is important to take extra care when out and about, regarding every surface as being contaminated and avoiding touching gates, fences and railings. Even if you feel healthy, you may be infected so clean your hands regularly to avoid infecting others. If you meet people when out and about, try to keep a distance of two metres.Older people should try to remain active and strong, as six out of 10 falls happen at home. Health experts are recommending that people carry out strength-building exercises if they are unable or unwilling to leave the house.Professor Sir Muir Gray, an expert in healthy ageing at Oxford University said: Being active can have a significant impact on preventing dementia and frailty. Many exercise studios and gyms have started releasing online classes so people can stay active while socially distancing.The new guidance suggests avoiding gatherings with friends and family and instead contacting people by phone, or on the internet or social media. Older people have been advised to avoid Sunday lunch with their children and grandchildren until further notice. However the guidelines say social distancing should be done as much as is pragmatic and for a host of regions it may not be sensible or practicable to avoid contact with others. People providing essential care for others, such as helping with washing, dressing or preparing meals, should carry on as usual but take extra care with hygiene. Greater care should be taken to avoid visiting the over-70s and those with health conditions, but popping in to see a healthy friend or relative is unlikely to cause the virus to spread if both are practising good hand-washing. If you do visit friends or relatives, avoid physical contact with others in social situations, including handshakes, hugs and kisses.Older people in care homes should try to avoid visitors as much as possible until the spread begins to die down.The chief medical officer for Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood, has suggested that older people should reduce their social contact by 75 per cent rather than shunning visitors completely. Many people will have dental or doctor\u0027s appointments in the coming weeks, and the Government is asking people to talk to their GP or clinician to discuss whether to come in or postpone them. Visiting a GPs surgery should pose no problems for people showing no symptoms of coronavirus, but it is better to seek advice online in the first instance and Boris Jounson has said people should avoid unnecessary visits to the NHS. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: If you have chronic lymphatic leukaemia and have to go to hospital once a month for treatment and you stopped going, your leukaemia would worsen and your life would be shortened. But there are lots of other routine visits that aren\u0027t as important, so you have to balance the risk. I think a lot of these will be cancelled anyway when we move to the main peak of the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"italy life like two weeks ago do not make mistakes did","story":"As we watch the coronavirus crisis unfold in Britain, there is a deep sense of déjà vu here in Italy.Two weeks ago, we were at exactly the same point that you are today.The day before, the Sunday, millions of Italians had taken advantage of sparkling spring weather to go out for the day – just as happened in the UK on Sunday.There was a feeling here that the situation was not too serious and in any case the health crisis was confined to Lombardy and surrounding areas, far to the north.My family and I blithely headed to a beach outside Rome for lunch with friends. It was packed.We had to call three restaurants before we could get a booking. Hundreds of people strolled along the sand, throwing sticks to dogs and playing with their kids – just as happened on Sunday in the UK.The next day, the Italian government scolded us all like naughty children. Ministers were furious. The sight of people crowding together and having lunch in groups was shameful and irresponsible, they said. People were just not understanding the gravity of the situation.Again, the parallels with Britain are uncanny. The government is angry that people failed to heed the call to avoid crowds and maintain social distancing, instead flocking to parks, gardens and the seaside.If our experience in Italy is anything to go by, a total lockdown in the UK is now all but inevitable.When it happened here, it came less than 24 hours after we were enjoying spaghetti alle vongole and chilled white wine at the beach near Rome.Since then, things have ratcheted up further.Police have conducted more than a million spot checks, making sure people have a valid reason to be out of their homes.The army has been deployed to Lombardy, the worst-hit region. In the city of Bergamo, the local cemetery was so overflowing with the dead that coffins had to be piled into military trucks and transported to other cities.Friends venturing out for a run have been berated by passers-by, who have told them they should be at home.After the lockdown was imposed, fleeing to a second home or country retreat was expressly forbidden.If you left the city in time, you were lucky if not, you were stuck.Shopping is allowed but it is a taut, nerve-wracking experience – all the staff, and most of the customers, wear face masks. No one lingers or chats. I found myself holding my breath as people passed close to me in the supermarket. The objective is to get in and get out as quickly as possible.Restaurants and bars were closed down. A decree announced by the government on Sunday means that we are not allowed to leave the municipality we find ourselves in.Until a couple of days ago, when the British government started to take the situation more seriously, Italians were baffled that the UK was not following the Italian model of preventative measures.“I see your lot are making a mess of it,” Giuseppe, the man who sells me my newspapers each morning, cheerily remarked on Friday.“Boris obstinate and contrary – the shutdown must wait,” was the headline in that day’s Corriere della Sera newspaper. “Britain is continuing to follow its own path, in (splendid?) isolation,” the daily remarked.“What then is the strategy of the British government, which to the rest of Europe appears to be folly?” the paper asked.While an Italy-style lockdown in Britain seems inevitable, let’s hope the UK does not follow Italy on the trajectory of deaths and infections.The situation here is grim in the extreme. There is a feeling that the contagion is out of control.On Saturday alone, 793 people died. On Sunday another 651 died, bringing the total death toll in Italy to nearly 5,500. There have been nearly 60,000 infections.It is just two weeks since Italy was put under lockdown, but it feels much longer.

The Kremlin said that everyone who takes part in meetings with the president is asked to test for coronavirus.Moscow, where more than half of Russia’s 438 coronavirus cases were recorded, has closed down theatres, cinemas and gyms but has stopped short of announcing a complete lockdown.The relatively low number of cases for the nation of 145 million is mostly explained by narrow testing as well as early restrictions that the government took in February by shutting down the border with China and barring Chinese nationals from the country.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/22/18/coronavirus-shops.jpg","title":"coronavirus primark shops closed shut hmv john lewis new look","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.More than 37,000 staff affected by latest move to slow down spread of Covid-19Primark announced it will close all 189 of its stores as retailers across the UK began locking down in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus.The fast-fashion business said the measure would affect some 37,000 staff but committed to paying employees their contracted hours for the next 14 days.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt came as a host of other high street shops, including John Lewis, HMV, Topshop\u0026nbspand New Look, also announced they were closing stores.Online shopping websites will not be affected by the shutdown.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Arcadia Group, the company that owns fashion brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, had already closed its stores “until further notice” from 4pm on Friday.“All store staff remain employees during this time and will be paid their normal pay for March plus any outstanding overtime payments, after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated,” the firm said in a statement.Ikea shut its 22 UK stores the same day, along with TK Maxx, Clarks and several other brands.New Look closed its stores at 5pm on Saturday and said it had extended its refund policy to 90 days.

Schools across the UK have also shut down, meaning lessons will be carried out using remote working apps.In an effort to ease the burden on internet infrastructure, Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube all announced plans to reduce the quality of streaming on their platforms.Despite concerns of more outages, BT offered assurances on Friday that its broadband network has the capacity to cope with the surge in demand.“The UK is one of the world’s most advanced digital economies, so we overbuild our networks to compensate for our love of high-definition streaming content,” BT’s chief technology officer Howard Watson wrote in a blog post.“The Covid-19 outbreak is causing changes to the way our networks are being used. We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed.”There have so far been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, resulting in close to 15,000 deaths.The sharpest rise in cases in recent days has been in the US, which overtook Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea over the last week to be the third worst affected country behind China and Italy.More than 100 million Americans have been ordered to stay at home, with eight states currently under lockdown.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed. However, the UK’s communications infrastructure is well within its capacity limits and has significant headroom for growth in demand.”​Other industry experts have warned that the measures may not be enough to prevent more outages, with GlobalData director Emma Mohr-McClune calling on other major bandwidth consumers to take similar action.Online video game platforms have already seen huge spikes in users in recent weeks – a trend that is expected to continue as the crisis progresses.\u0026nbspDesktop gaming client Steam broke its all-time record for the highest number of concurrent users over the weekend, seeing over 20 million gamers use the platform at one time.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem“Although video streaming represents the lion’s share of residential internet traffic in Europe, interactive online gaming is a substantially greater threat in network overload terms.

Developers would aim to allow organisations such as the UN\u0027s health agencies to share information more quickly, and to be able to speed up replies to commonly asked questions using tools such as automated responses.Facebook also said it would run an online hackathon with the aim of encouraging developers to build messaging solutions that address issues related to the coronavirus such as social distancing and access to accurate information. Participants would get special acess to Messenger tools and educational materials, Facebook said, and the winners will get mentors from the company to help them build their ideas.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It looks outwardly near-identical to the current model, but it offers better value, increased storage and faster performance. But even these things are not the game-changer: that’s the new keyboard.The pricing first: where the previous MacBook Air, on sale until just days ago, cost £1,099 and came with 128GB of internal storage, the entry-level Air is now £100 less, £999, and has 256GB of storage. There’s also a 512GB model available, with a faster processor, for £1,299. There are still lots of laptops out there for much less money, but this price represents good value. Note that Apple has education pricing for those in class as students or teachers, so it’s possible to get that price even lower if you qualify.The look is the same as before: sleek and classy. It comes in three colours, silver, space grey and gold. The space grey is the best: solid and businesslike without looking boring, though the gold, warm with a peachy hint to it, is also a head-turner.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe build quality of the MacBook Air is exceptional, an all-aluminium casing that’s sculpted to the slimmest of edges to make it easy to pick up. Like all MacBooks, and unlike many other laptops, you can open it with one hand, the build is so perfectly balanced. Other machines require a finger to hold down the keyboard as you open the lid or the whole thing swings up as it opens.This MacBook Air continues to have a power button with Touch ID built in – a fingerprint scanner that ensures your computer screen locks when you’re away from it and only unlocks to your finger. Apple Watch wearers can also use their smart timepiece to unlock the MacBook Air, which is cool. Both mechanisms feel intimate and secure.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The Air has two Thunderbolt USB-C ports. For other connections, such as USB-A, you’ll need an adaptor. That’s not always convenient, though it gets easier all the time as more accessories switch to USB-C, and it helps to keep the Air thin.The MacBook Air has been preposterously slim and light since it was first unveiled by Steve Jobs in 2008 when the then-CEO slid it out of an envelope to an admiring crowd. It was so much thinner and lighter than the competition that it drew gasps of excitement. Over the next decade it slipped behind, especially in terms of the screen resolution, though that’s been fixed. Now, the 13in display is bright, rich and superbly high-resolution.Apple releases iPad with 3D scanner and a trackpadApple and Netflix pull out of SXSW over coronavirus fearsAnd then there’s the new keyboard. Apple keyboards were traditionally outstanding, using a scissor-switch mechanism, with lots of travel and a great feel. Then, a few years ago, Apple changed to a whole new system, using a butterfly mechanism. The first-generation of this was quite noisy, but this was overcome in subsequent versions. But then, problems arose which led to keyboards being replaced as users complained that there wasn’t the same reliability.Last year, on the MacBook Pro 16in, Apple introduced the Magic Keyboard – a name taken from its desktop wireless keyboard – which changed everything. The new keys were quieter, more stable and had more travel – a full 1mm. That’s not quite as much as the keys moved before the butterfly landed, when it was 1.2mm. But it was enough, and it was a revelation.It’s the same here. Using the new keyboard subtly transforms the typing experience. It’s not that the butterfly keys were bad: unless they failed, they worked well and were comfortable to use.But as soon as you use the new Magic Keyboard, you recognise how comfortable and inviting it is. The downside is it’s quite hard to go back. Having typed this review on the MacBook Air keys, I picked up a previous Air to make a comparison. As soon as I started typing, my fingers told me I was missing the new experience. The keys on the old Air, which I had used happily before, just couldn’t match the luxurious and satisfying feel of the new one. The gentle scoop on the top of each key that helps your fingers find the right place to touch, the crisper inidual backlighting to make typing in a less bright room a breeze and the clearer lettering on each key – all of which are small, subtle improvements that Apple has made with the Magic Keyboard – add up to something big.The processor has been improved on the latest models with a 1.1GHz dual-core Core i3 processor on the £999 model and a 1.1GHz quad-core Core i5 chip on the £1,299 version.In practical terms, this means that the Air is a real performer. Not that it was a slouch before, but it handles tasks easily. It’s true, the MacBook Pro is still the go-to laptop for those doing advanced video processing or running other power-hungry programs. But the Air is now very fast and effective. To the extent that many customers may ask whether they really need to spend £1,299 on the entry-level 13in MacBook Pro rather than a £999 MacBook Air that isn’t that far off. Sure, there are other extras in the Pro range, like the spiffy Touch Bar instead of function keys, and four Thunderbolt USB-C sockets instead of two on the Air, for instance.Battery life on the MacBook Air is exemplary: it just goes on and on all day where other laptops, including some MacBook Pro models, don’t last as long. It’s so good that you may not even think about checking how much charge is left in the battery. It gives a great feeling of peace of mind.The new MacBook Air is available for order now, with deliveries starting next week. It represents a big step forward for the super-slim Apple laptop, combining sumptuous good looks with real performance and, above all, an unbeatably appealing keyboard.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Similar signs across rural Wales are less polite.Locals in this tourist hotspot are incensed because\u0026nbspsecond home owners and holidaymakers are travelling here to self-isolate in the countryside. Official advice is to avoid non-essential travel but many caravan parks and holiday cottages are still open to guests.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIf those who\u0026nbspbecome ill in Newport can’t be treated\u0026nbspat Withybush, they will have to go to Glangwili General in Carmarthen, which is an hour’s drive and has 14 critical care beds.It’s not just health fears that have locals worrying. Food shops were not prepared for an influx of visitors and supplies of staples such as flour, bread and\u0026nbsplentils are becoming hard to find. Shop owners say the last few days have been as busy as the peak summer season.Clare Thomas, shopkeeper and owner of Whole Foods of Newport, is quickly adapting to the crisis. The 43-year-old has multiple sclerosis and a teenage daughter and knows she must avoid getting the virus but is keen to keep the shop open. She has noticed the town filling up over the last few days.“A week last Friday, the first person I recognise from the summer came in,” the 43-year-old said. “He comes to us all the time, he’s got a second home here, he’s an accountant in London. He sort of said, ‘Oh London’s absolutely crazy, I’ve come down to escape’. And I thought, oh my god, I know the virus is a bit more advanced up there’. It didn’t feel very nice.“Then Saturday, I just noticed more and more people coming in. By Monday, it was getting really busy, it seemed like summer here.”She has made changes to the shop – customers now order from a table at the front and only two are allowed in at a time — but still she has been running out of stock. One of her two suppliers has stopped taking business and the other, Suma, has been able to deliver only half of her order. It isn’t just panic-buying she knows which customers are local and can see an influx.“My daughter and I were coming out of Newport at the weekend and seeing all these big posh cars and we had a joke – first one to spot a local,” she said. “We went all through town and didn’t spot anybody. There was a Lamborghini, a Mercedes, big Land Rovers.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’ve got an ageing population, they’ll probably kill off half the people round here.”There are nearly 4,000 second homes in Pembrokeshire, according to the council. The size of the average UK household is 2.4, so that could mean an extra 9,600 people for the county to take in.Earlier in the crisis, businesses welcomed tourists. One holiday cottage company produced an advert that read: “SCHOOLS OUT! Escape to secluded Pembrokeshire with the family at non school holiday prices”. They have since withdrawn the advert and have stopped taking bookings.Three counties in west Wales – Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire – issued a joint statement on Sunday asking tourists not to visit. Welsh Assembly minister Vaughan Gething said he and the Welsh first minister are considering how to use legal powers to stop second home owners and tourists from travelling to the country.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government updated its advice on Sunday, saying: “Essential travel does not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.”For some here, that advice is not enough. They say measures need to be strengthened.Tim Thomas, an electrician who lives in Newport, said the Spar — the main store in the town — was stripped of food on Sunday night.“I think it’s very selfish of them all, we haven’t got the infrastructure in this neck of the woods,” he said. “Jumping in the car and coming down to your second home is total stupidity.”To anyone else thinking of travelling, he had a clear message: “Stay at home – Boris has made it quite simple. It’s very very simple.“These are meant to be intelligent people with lots of money, because they can afford second houses, and they can’t put two and two together.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We appreciate the urgency of the situation, and officials are working around the clock to find a well-targeted support package.”But IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Many low-paid and precarious workers are on the frontlines of this crisis, distributing food, delivering medical samples, cleaning buildings and looking after children in need, yet they have the least protection.“Many who become sick or need to self-isolate will receive little or no sick pay. Others who are laid off will not receive wage subsidies from the government because they are not employees.“No one wants to be litigating right now, but we also cannot stand by while our members are exposed to unnecessary risk or driven into destitution.”IWGB, which was founded in 2012 to represent precarious workers in the modern gig economy, has launched a crowdfunding appeal for £20,000 to help fund legal costs in the battle.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As important as it may be to self-isolate, having to live for half a month on £94.25 per week would make my life impossible. I would have to choose between buying food for my family and following the government’s health advice to protect the public.”Greg Howard, a Deliveroo rider and Secretary of the IWGB’s Couriers and Logistics branch said: “While other workers are being offered some assistance during the Covid-19 pandemic, as a ‘gig economy’ worker I am being refused even the most basic protections. While the government expects workers such as myself to provide essential services during this crisis, if I am sick or if the company I work for has to downsize, I’ll be driven into deeper hardship. The law has to change so that it protects all workers.”Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemIn 2018 the European Committee on Social Rights, an enforcement body of the Council of Europe, warned the government that the UK’s low rates of statutory sick pay were “manifestly inadequate” and in breach of the legally-binding European Social Charter.The IWGB was joined in its call for action on the self-employed on Monday by former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the government needed to offer further help regardless of the cost to the public finances.\u0026nbspIndependent Workers Union of Great Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That warning – which has been around for years – appears to be entirely fake, and there is no reason to worry about any such message.It also includes a common reminder about WhatsApp Gold, and urges anyone reading the message not to be taken in by scams promising it. For once, this message is not in itself a hoax: there really is a scam that promises WhatsApp Gold or WhatsApp Plus, and that is often used as a way to trick people into downloading malicious software or otherwise trick them into believing in scams.But the Pope message\u0026nbspthen also goes onto warn about another video, and urges people to pass it on.Please inform all contacts from your list not to open a video called the \u0027Dance of the Pope\u0027, a representative example reads.

Fwd this msg to as many as you can!The call to share the wording that comes\u0026nbspat the end appears to have worked, and the message has been passed quickly across WhatsApp and beyond.There has been no such announcement of any kind of virus on BBC radio. The rest of the message is so vague that it is impossible to know what it really refers to, but it does not appear to be linked to any real threat.Experts caution that users should\u0026nbspbe cautious about any files they receive over messaging apps, especially if they come from unknown people or have strange wording or names attached to them.

People can be seen hanging laundry. Children play. One man eats noodles. Another smokes a cigarette.Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut even as the number of new reported cases stops in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered.

Opposition parties said on Saturday that they want an all-party discussion about the bill on Monday before parliament holds a session.“The aim of the proposal is ... to allow Hungary’s government to create and keep in effect its special decrees” even if parliament does not hold a session due to coronavirus in 2020, the bill said.“No one knows how long we have to maintain this state of crisis,” Mate Kocsis, head of the Mr Orban’s ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group, told private television HirTv.Kocsis said the government wants to pass the bill in an accelerated procedure, which needs support from 80 per cent of lawmakers.

He tweeted: “It’s a state of emergency, btw. Lives are at stake.”Hungary has experienced 107 confirmed cases of coronavirus and seven people have died from the disease, according to Johns Hopkins University.In 2015, during the peak of the migration crisis, Hungary declared a state of emergency due to mass migration which has been in effect ever since, even though the number of migrants reaching Hungary’s southern border fence has fallen.\u0026nbspMr Orban’s Fidesz party was suspended from the mainstream centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) group in the European Parliament in March over its record on respect for the rule of law, freedom of the press and minorities’ rights.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These materials are provided in English and nine additional languages from affected areas, and are available at all international airports, ports and international train stations.“We are testing established arrangements already in place for caring for unwell people arriving at airports to make sure the system is ready locally. We are also providing guidance and briefing to staff, so they know what to expect and how best to respond.”Public Health Englands medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, said that washing hands with soap and water is more effective than wearing a face mask, although face masks are important for staff to use in hospitals when dealing with suspected cases.On March , Boris Johnson revealed the governments battle plan to tackle the spread of Covid-.During a press conference at No, the British Prime Minister said: The army is of course always ready as and when, but that is under the worst case scenario.Contingency plans are in place for anything from a mild pandemic through to a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in  known as Spanish Flu.Police could also be told to switch their focus to only tackle serious crime  emergency services start to buckle under pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"cobra meeting time today","story":"The UK leader is considering stricter measures to keep people in their homes after the death toll from the bug in this country passed .Boris Johnson called an emergency Cobra meeting for pm on Monday  March.It came after schools closed from today and the UKs death toll for coronavirus passed .On Sunday he also announced plans to ask .million vulnerable an at risk people to stay at home for a period of  weeks.The prime minister is expected to discuss stricter measures to keep people in their homes and slow the spread of the virus.Last Friday he ordered pubs, bars, restaurants and leisure centres to close their doors immediately.But pictures from over the weekend showed public gathering in parks and other areas and not respecting the social distancing guidelines.The outcome of the Cobra meeting on March  was discussed in a press conference where the prime minister advised Brits to work from home.He also urged over s to avoid others and families with symptoms to stay home for two weeks in order to stop the spread of the bug.The Cobra meeting was targeted at the most vulnerable people in society including pregnant women who were advised to avoid contact.Mass gatherings were affected as from March  with the government effectively banning them.Cobra - sometimes referred to as just COBR - stands for the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms.The A is added as the meetings commonly take place in Briefing Room A.They are meeting rooms situated in Downing Street in London, within Cabinet Office buildings and used for committees which coordinate the actions of government bodies in response to national or regional crisis.Cobra meetings are called in response to national emergencies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is a time for unity and for respecting others, especially the most vulnerable.As the Queen put it yesterday in her admirable statement: “I am reminded that our nation’s history has been forged by people and communities coming together to work as one, concentrating our combined efforts with a focus on the common goal.”As the emergency deepens, abuse of privilege should play no part in our national response.But that is exactly what is now happening, as is graphically demonstrated by the saga of private Covid- tests kits.One of the biggest problems the Government faces is the shortage of capacity for testing.To prevent the current system from being overwhelmed by demand, NHS policy is only to test people with a “high chance” of having the illness, such as those who have ed from high-risk countries or are displaying symptoms.Even doctors and nurses working in the front-line are not routinely tested.But to evade such official restrictions, a growing number of the rich and famous are forking out for private coronavirus kits, which can cost anything between £ and £.According to one report this week, more than , wealthy figures in Britain have ordered such kits.Dr Mark Ali, director of the Harley Street clinic, said: “We have private iniduals – some recognisable names there – and we are testing lords and ladies and even doctors and dentists who are worried about catching the disease.”It is the same story of privileged access in the US, where, just as in Britain, shortages of supplies mean that many health care workers and sick people are unable to get diagnoses.But some stars seek to bypass rules that limit tests to those most at risk.A huge controversy erupted this week at the news that eight top NBA basketball teams has been tested, making a mockery of the rationing.Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, spoke for much of the public when he said that “an entire NBA team should not get tested for Covid- while there are critically ill patients waiting to be tested. Tests should not be for the wealth, but for the sick.”On both sides of the Atlantic, this two-tiered approach is wrong on so many levels.It is a deep insult to healthcare workers. It is profoundly isive.And it does not lessen the burdens on the NHS here in Britain, as some apologists pretend.Those who test positive will still have to be treated in the health service, since the British private medical sector does not have the resources for this crisis.Selfish and irresponsible, the Covid-test queue jumpers are the equivalents of the supermarket stockpilers or the social distancing refuseniks who still insist on going down to the pub.During the Second World War, when the Blitz spirit was at its peak, there was fierce hostility to rich iniduals who tried to cheat on rationing regulations or avoid national service.The same contempt should now be shown to those who try to dodge the rules that promote fairness.But it is not just in testing where the narrow self-centredness of the rich can be found. They use their wealth to insulate themselves in other ways.Some are buying special private medical care, like intravenous infusions of vitamins and minerals to boost their immune system.Lansherhof, a private medical facility at the London Arts Club, reported this week an  per cent increase in enquires for its Immune Plus Support Infusion, which costs £.The rich are also using private jet travel to avoid the rest of the public as they conduct business or fly to remote havens.Inquiries for international flights by private jets are estimated to be up nine-fold since the outbreak began, while Hong Kong International Airport reported this week its busiest day for private jet activity.Nor do the rich have to endure the normal airport ordeal suffered by other passengers.A spokeswoman for Quintessentially, a concierge company for millionaires, said: “Members who are travelling commercially are choosing to book elite services at airports, not your typical first-class lounge.For example, private terminals where guests are greeted and given their own suite.Check-in, customs and security are all done privately and guests are taken to the doors of the aircraft.Members can request for the jetty to be cleared so they minimise the interactions with other passengers”.Most Brits have no choice over where they live in the midst of this crisis.But that is not true of the wealthy who can find sanctuary in one of their many properties or rent out an expensive rural bolt-hole.Some are now paying £,-a-month for a luxury base in the Cotswolds.Nor does self-isolation have to be the imprisoning experience that it is for ordinary citizens.The rich can bring in private chefs for their dinners, or expensive tutors for their children.The company Tutors International, which provides elite tuition services, says it has seen “a massive upswing in requests” since the outbreak began.The elite even have luxury face masks. The fashionable Airinum Urban Air Mask costs £ and claims to protect “against airborne particles as small as .mm.”But in this rarefied world, problems are faced by the elite that would never be considered by others.Wailing that she now has now chance to show off her expensive jewellery, one female financier in London says: “I’m just not sure when my next ball will be.”The experience of the affluent is in dramatic contrast to the misery faced by people at the other end of the scale.While the rich cocoon themselves, it is the wage-earners, the straitened households, the poor and the unemployed who are now in the eye of the storm.Our society is just beginning to realize the terrying consequences of this disaster, where the mounting death toll is matched by economic meltdown.Vast numbers of people – from hotel cleaners to airline cabin crew, from bar staff to retail assistants – are going to lose their jobs.The ranks of the five million self-employed will be decimated. Small businesses across the country will collapse.Food banks are already running short of supplies, while the plight of the homeless – who cannot isolate themselves on the streets – is desperate as shelters close.At worst, our prosperous civilisation could slide into a kind of modern feudal structure, with only the aristocracy at the top enjoying a decent standard of living.At a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Trump was asked whether “the well-connected go to the front of the line”.He replied philosophically: “You’d have to ask them that. Perhaps that’s been the story of le.”But it should not be that way, especially when mankind is facing one of its darkest hours.We should all be in this together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over.

If we need to take further steps to reduce social interactions, we will.Speaking after Boris Johnson warned there would be more to come, Mr Hancock said: People need to stay two metres apart.If that isnt followed, we are going to have to take more draconian action.As Health Secretary, Im working every hour there is protect people.He said a decision would be made very soon.Actions which could be on the cards could include dramatic measures to force people to stay in their homes.Already parks and open spaces are being shut as people cram themselves in to try and get fresh air, but the Government may take action to close them across the board. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the high numbers of people who went out to parks and more rural areas at the weekend, defying government advice.She said: It is not acceptable. The Government could not have been clearer that in order to save lives and to protect the public during this public health emergency, it is right that we practise social distancing in the way in which the Government has outlined, the Government is reinforcing, the chief medical officer and many others are reinforcing day in, day out.And with that, we ask the public to take responsibility.In France and Italy already people have to have paperwork to leave their house and face on the spot finesthey do not obey the rules.Some countries have one nominated person who can go out and get shopping and other supplies.Germany has banned more than two people from meeting at a time.Ministers are also considering wider shutdowns of shops and other public spaces, it was claimed this morning.Last week No played down the prospect of a London travel ban - insisting that travel both in and out of the capital would not be shut.But the PM is under huge pressure to take all measures possible to try and stop Britain becoming the new Italy.Ministers and MPs are worried that Boris isnt going far enough to stop this becoming a full blown crisis and thousands of people dying needlessly.Labours Jonathan Ashworth said they would support a tougher crackdown too, saying: If voluntary social distancing measures are not adhered to, the government must bring forward their plans for stronger action.And expected new Labour boss Sir Keir Starmer said more action as needed too like in other counties, saying: In these extraordinary times, the Government must now set out further compliance measures, such as those introduced in other countries.One source told Buzzfeed that the mood among Cabinet ministers and senior advisers would be full scale mutinyhe does not upgrade the response as soon as possible.A government source said it was a question of how long it would be before more lockdown measures come.They said: It is inevitable, you just have to look at other countries.

Do shopping for elderly neighbours, only buy what you need.He added: There are instructions and rules we need to obey to stop people dying.Making sure there is no confusion or mixed messages, people should not be leaving their homes unless they have to, they can walk dogs or exercise, but mixing socially leads to more people dying.It is often impossible for families to stay cooped up inside for days on end.Parents of young children, especially, will find it tough. But there has to be some common sense.We must all do our best to follow the Government’s advice to leave a -metre gap between ourselves and the next person when outdoors.Yes, a bunch of irresponsible idiots think they’re invincible and are choosing to flout the rules. Flocking to beaches and parks to sunbathe in large groups is plainly not sensible.Despite dire warnings that we are only a fortnight behind Italy where so many have died, large numbers of people here are still not getting the message.Most Brits are keen to do what’s right.Butnot enough of us take heed then we face restrictions the like of which have never been seen before.The stakes really are that high.In his address to the nation yesterday, Mr Johnson said: I dont think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very very actively in the next  hours.We need to think about the kind of measures weve seen where - other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on peoples movements altogether, now as I say I dont want to do that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a former Cabinet minister is calling for Boris Johnson to go further by introducing a rewritten Bill in  monthsapos timethe powers are still deemed necessary. This afternoon MPs are gearing up to debate and sign off on strict measures that would grant ministers, councils, police, health professionals and coroners increased controls. Sweeping changes will include reducing the number of doctors required to sign off on sectioning those with mental health issues from two to one, while police would be given authority to force those infected with Covid- to self-isolate. Labour have welcomed the change but Shami Chakrabarti, the Shadow Attorney General said they would prefer even more frequent reviews. It came after David Davis, the ex-Brexit secretary, said six-monthly reviews were not sufficient to keep such wide-reaching legislation in check and predicted there were likely to be mistakes in the -plus pages of emergency legislation. Senior ministers are currently attempting to limit the peak number of infections to reduce pressure on the NHS. As of Sunday morning, there were , cases in the UK and  patients who had tested positive for coronavirus had died.

The announcement followed concern from some MPs that the extensive powers contained in the legislation could be in place for two years. But Mr Davis said he feared the current set of powers contained in the fast-tracked Bill would give the Government undue strengths which could infringe on civil liberties. His comments come after Labouraposs shadow equalities minister Naz Shah submitted an amendment, backed by  MPs, to exempt those from faith backgrounds from automatically being crematedthey die after contracting coronavirus.  There are anxieties, especially among Jews and Muslims whose faiths forbid cremation, that local authorities, in the event the number of deaths increase dramatically, will be able to use the emergency powers to disregard legal safeguards that currently prevent the cremation of human remains against the wishes of the deceased. Mr Davis said he was personally concerned that powers allowing the Government to postpone elections could be misused.  The civil liberties campaigner said: This Bill was put together in five days, it is -odd pages long. It is guaranteed, bluntly, that it will have mistakes and unnecessary elements to it. Those mistakes will all be in one direction and thataposs giving more power to the Government than is necessary. The senior Conservative MP said a six-month sunset clause would not go far enough in terms of checks.

The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We set out steps on Friday in relation to those premises which we needed to shut in order to reduce social interaction.  But weaposve also said that we will continue to be guided by the science and by the medical advice, andthereaposs more that we need to do then we will do so. Concerns have been raised about the number of people taking the London Underground after the service was reduced. Several social media users posted images of busy London Underground lines, with commuters in close proximity despite Government pleas to practice social distancing. Some claimed there was little other option for those who needed to travel in for work, since a number of services had been reduced by Transport for London. Nurse Julia Harris tweeted pictures of queues and a packed carriage at North Greenwich tube station, where trains were running every seven minutes. She urged Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Boris Johnson to address the situation, adding: This is becoming dangerous for critical workers.There have also been questions about whether or not building sites should remain open. Yesterday Boris Johnson said: “We need to think about the kinds of measures that we’ve seen where, other countries that have been forced to bring in restrictions on people’s movements altogether,” Johnson said. The sht in language prompted the Construction Leadership Council to convene an emergency meeting later today on how long sites stay open for with BuildUK set to issue more guidance on what sites should be doing to stay open. It is hoped that further protections for the self employed might help more workers stay home.  Number  signalled that help may be coming, with officials working around the clock to find a well-targeted support package. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman told reporters on Monday morning: We understand the dficult position the self-employed are in. We have always said we will go further where we can and are actively considering further steps. We appreciate the urgency of the situation and officials are working around the clock to find a well-targeted support package. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced a package of support to help employers survive the coronavirus shutdown and continue to pay their staff. He said any employer in the country would be eligible for the coronavirus job retention scheme.  On further powers in lockdown, a Downing St spokesman said today: The Health Secretary set out the governmentaposs position. Our message is clear people should stay at homepossible.

Mr Johnson warned Brits could soon face the tougher measures adopted in other European countries like Italy and Francepeople did not behave responsibly. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Mr Johnson has faced criticism for not acting faster to slow the spread of the virus. He also raised questions when he appeared to contradict himself by telling Brits not to visit their mums on Motheraposs Day while saying he hoped to see his own mum.

He later said he would be calling her. The government has already shut down pubs, clubs and restaurants across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But authorities were dismayed by the scenes over the weekend as pictures and footage flooded in from around the country.  Huge lines crowded to climb the Snowdon peak in Wales, and in London, large groups and cyclists packed out popular parks. Several local authorities, including Hammersmith and Fulham Council, took the step of closing all their parks in response to the crowds. And the Royal Parks issued a warning that while its parks remain open for now, it could be forced to close them, as it announced it was shutting all remaining take-away cafes and kiosks: with immediate effect as people are not adhering to social distancing guidelines. Mr Johnson said Government had always followed the scientic advice when it came to access to open spaces - but warned people needed to observe the guidance that they should not gather in groups and remain two metres apart. What they have always said so far is that the health benefits for the whole of society of keeping the parks and playgrounds openwe possibly can outweigh the epidemiological value of closing them, he said.  But of course looking at the way people behave and the way they are responding, we keep that under constant, constant review. If people canapost make use of parks and playgrounds responsibly,they canapost do it in a way that observes the two-metre rule then of course we are going to have to look at further measures. The general principle should be that we should all as far as we possibly can stay home, protect our NHS and thereby save lives. He added: I donapost think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very very actively in the next  hours. The Government later issued updated guidance on essential travel, saying it did not include visits to second homes, camp sites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. Earlier, in a message to the nation, the Prime Minister warned Britain was only two or three weeks behind Italy where the death toll has already risen above , making it the worst outbreak anywhere in the world. In the UK, the death toll stands at , with , confirmed cases.  However experts have warned the number of cases is likely much higher, as many Brits and NHS staff say not everyone with Covid- symptoms is being tested. He said that unless the UK could control the spread of the virus through social distancing, the NHS would be overwhelmed in the same way that the Italian healthcare system had been. However the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, cautioned against comparing the UKaposs figures too closely with other countriesapos. As you go through a sharp rise in numbers, which we will see going forward, you have to be careful to be comparing too precisely, she said.  We will look back in due course, sadly, and see the true number of people who have died from coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has since warned the Government may have to take further actionpeople continue to flout social distancing rules of staying two metres away from each other. He told Sky News: This is not the sort of thing that anybody would want to do but, of course, it is the sort of thing we might have to do in order to protect le. If you do go out, you must not get closer than two metres from someone who isnapost in your household.It is a really simple rule and incredibly important, because to protect le and the NHS we need to stop the spread of this virus and the virus spreads by people coming into close contact with each other.  Elsewhere other political figures adopted a notably more strident tone than the Prime Minister as they warned people not to leave their homes other than for essential business. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, whose city is at the centre of the epidemic in Britain, has ordered the city to stay off its public transport networks, including the London Underground, unless it is for essential travel. Mr Khan said people must obey the guidance or others would die. This isnapost advice, as far as Iaposm concerned. These are instructions and these are rules that we should all obey to stop people dying, he told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced she was closing the ferries to the Scottish islands to all non-essential travellers after the military was brought in to transport a patient to the mainland. She said people should not go shopping except for essentials like food and medicine and she condemned people flocking to Scotlandaposs remote communities for adding to the pressure on local health services. Beaches should not be busy, parks should not be full, she said.

Yet victory will be temporaryCovid- in  is followed by choking austerity that strangled a stronger recovery after the  global banking collapse. Labour Left-winger John McDonnell’s pointed quip that the Tories are now also Marxists underlines the hollowness of Boris Johnson’s election claims that Labour would bankrupt the UK. Sunak being forced to borrow more than Gordon Brown in the financial crisis, and debt spiralling above £trillion, is as necessary as it was a dozen years ago. With % knocked off the FTSE- and unemployment poised to soar, Brown and TUC chief Frances O’Grady were on the side of the angels. The fear is Johnson and Sunak will repeat the mistakes of David Cameron and George Osborne – who wrongly blamed rising deficits  years ago on spending on nurses, teachers and the poor to justy self-defeating Tory squeezes on pay and services. History repeats itself first as tragedy then as farce, as McDonnell, the vindicated Marxist, reminded me in the recent past. Johnson has conveniently embraced the public intervention and regulation he ideologically decries but it isn’t his get-out-of-jail-free card. Labour’s likely next leader Keir Starmer must pin Johnson’s fatal errors on him.

Former teacher, Pamela Kilburn, , has been dragged out of retirement to give her grandchildren daily lessons online. While nanna, Valerie Turner, , an expat who is in lockdown in Spain, is giving them long distance dance lessons in tap and ballet. Even grandad, former journalist John Turner, , who is also trapped overseas, is being put to work by taking story-time for the youngsters. Jane, , and Steve Turner, , from Colne in Lancashire, came up with the idea after they had to close their restaurant business and started delivering to those isolated. They also wanted to find a way to keep their children, Annabelle, nine and Beau, seven, occupied and cheer up the grandparents who are all in isolation. Mum Jane Turner, added: “My mum has been in tears over this, she was bawling her eyes out. Itaposs a really weird feeling for them. “She canapost do any of her normal routine and sheaposs completely and utterly alone. “So we are aiming to do this very day.

This helps them and my kids. “Pamela is totally on her own and we donapost want to put them in danger but also we miss them. “Iaposm thinking of the needs of our parents and our kids needs.

Around . million will receive letters, texts or phone calls this week telling them they must stay home for  weeks and avoid ALL social contact known as aposshieldingapos. Shielding is a measure to protect extremely vulnerable people by minimising interaction between those who are extremely vulnerable and others. This means that those who are extremely vulnerable should not leave their homes, and within their homes should minimise all non-essential contact with other members of their household. This is to protect those who are at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirusfrom coming into contact with the virus.Those with severe respiratory conditions, such as asthma, “face the highest risk of being hospitalised by coronavirus ”.Those in the high risk category have been told not to leave their home and only open a window to get fresh air. They must stay  steps away from others indoors and wash their hands more often, for at least  seconds.  Here are the strict measures in full The measures are: . Strictly avoid contact with someone who is displaying symptoms of coronavirus . These symptoms include high temperature and or new and continuous cough. . Do not leave your house. . Do not attend any gatherings. This includes gatherings of friends and families in private spaces for example family homes, weddings and religious services. . Do not go out for shopping, leisure or travel and, when arranging food or medication deliveries, these should be left at the door to minimise contact. . Keep in touch using remote technology such as phone, internet, and social media. Do use telephone or online services to contact your GP or other essential services. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  What should you doyou have someone  living with you  Whilst the rest of your household are not required to adopt these protective shielding measures for themselves, we would expect them to do what they can to support you in shielding and to stringently follow guidance on social distancing. . Minimise as much as possible the time other family members spend in shared spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas, and keep shared spaces well ventilated. . Aim to keep  metresaway from people you live with and encourage them to sleep in a dferent bed where possible. If you can, you should use a separate bathroom from the rest of the household. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for drying themselves after bathing or showering and for hand-hygiene purposes. . If you do share a toilet and bathroom with others, it is important that they are cleaned after use every time . Another tip is to consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. . If you share a kitchen with others, avoid using it while they are present. If you can, you should take your meals back to your room to eat. If you have one, use a dishwasher to clean and dry the family’s used crockery and cutlery. If this is not possible, wash them using your usual washing up liquid and warm water and dry them thoroughly. If you are using your own utensils, remember to use a separate tea towel for drying these. . We understand that it will be dficult for some people to separate themselves from others at home. You should do your very best to follow this guidance and everyone in your household should regularly wash their hands, avoid touching their face, and clean frequently touched surfaces. If the rest of your household stringently follow advice on social distancing and minimise the risk of spreading the virus within the home by following the advice above, there is no need for them to also shield alongside you. Handwashing and respiratory hygiene There are general principles you should follow to help prevent the spread of airway and chest infections caused by respiratory viruses, including: * wash your hands more often - with soap and water for at least  seconds or use a hand sanitiser. Do this after you blow your nose, sneeze or cough, and after you eat or handle food * avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands * avoid close contact with people who have symptoms * cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in a bin * clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces in the home What is the advice for visitors, including those who are providing care for you  Contact regular visitors to your home, such as friends and family to let them know that you are shielding and that they should not visit you during this time unless they are providing essential care for you. Essential care includes things like help with washing, dressing, or feeding. If you receive regular health or social care from an organisation, either through your local authority or paid for by yourself, inform your care providers that you are shielding and agree a plan for continuing your care. If you receive essential care from friends or family members, speak to your carers about extra precautions they can take to keep you safe. You may find this guidance on home care provision useful. Speak to your carers about backup plans for your care in case your main carer is unwell and needs to self-isolate. If you need help with care but you’re not sure who to contact, oryou do not have family or friends who can help you, you can contact your local council who will be able to help you and assess any social care needs you might have. Please visit gov.uk coronavirus-extremely-vulnerable to register for support that you need. For those concerned they have coronavirus in the UK, Public Health England has issued advice about how to self-isolate. .

Worryingly, this has resulted in many people thinking itaposs not too bad, with some even saying they donapost mindthey get it. Intensive care specialist Professor High Montgomery has explained why this really isnapost the case, and the staggering dference between the two illness. The main dference - and what makes it so much more dangerous - is it is far more contagious.Speaking to Channel , he explains thathe was to get the normal flu he would infect an average of . people.If they then go on to do the same, each of them infects . people. Do that  times, and heaposs responsible for  cases of the flu.  However, this strain of coronavirus - Covid- - is much more infectious.That means thathe was to get it, he would pass it to three people, and they would in turn pass it to another three. He said: Not that doesnapost sound like much of a dference, but each of those three passes it onto another three and that happens at ten layers, I have been responsibly for infecting , people.  Professor Montgomery goes on to explain why, despite some peopleaposs attitudes, itaposs so much worse than feeling a bit rough. He said: Most people are going to feel a bit pokey, or not very pokey, and feel just fine - but they will have spread it around. A few will get sick at about  days into their illness, so they will need to come to hospital. When they are in hospital they will consume resources and time and people will look after them, quite rightly, and they will be monitored to seethey become really, really sick.  He explains thatpeople become very ill they will be moved to an intensive care unit. This is the issue. If weaposve got a limit resource, which we have, a limited number of ventilators, a limited number of doctors, a limited number of nurses,we overwhelm that, we canapost provide that service of caring for people properly. He goes on to stress the point even further that itaposs vital that everybody does their bit to stop the spread.  He says: Itaposs going to be ugly, itaposs going to be horrible for a large number of people - but it will be a small number of people who get properly sick and a smaller percentage of those again that need to come to an intensive care unit. We can save the lives of a large number of those people.

The most common symptoms of coronavirus are a dry, persistent cough and a fever. The young woman, who tweets from the handle @JuliaBuscaglia, shared her experience on Twitter. I was not going to share my story, but now that I see others are reporting very dferent symptoms than mine I feel it’s important to tell everyone my experience, she wrote. Julia went on to tweet a timeline of her illness, in diary-form. February th: I woke up this day in agony, her first post read. My head was pounding, my ears throbbing, and it felt asmy throat was on fire. My body ached, I had chills, and I had a fever of .. I took over the counter anti-inflammatories and stayed in bed the entire day.  The next tweet jumped forward to Juliaaposs last day in Italy, on March rd. I still couldn’t hear, and at this point I lost all ability to taste and smell, yet I did not have a runny nose or cough, it read. I had a headache constantly during the day which I just treated with Tylenol. I left the next morning toto America. She described March th as the day that scared her to look back on. I flew home, and not a single person asked where I had been. Not even at customs. They didn’t blink an eye at me. I had layovers in LARGE cities. Again, there was no doubt in my mind that I didn’t have the virus. March th-th: As we were told, I stayed in self quarantine during these days, the next tweet read. I had contact with only two people. No symptoms were present that the CDC warned us about. I had a WET cough. And my hearing, taste, and smell finally ed. On Friday  March, Julia got tested for the virus. This was not her plan, she explained, but rather the consequence of having family members working in the health sector, who wanted her to be sure she was well before ing to work. She had to ask repeatedly to be tested, according to her tweets. Julia said she got a call on March , informing her she had tested positive for Covid-. My jaw DROPPED, she recalled.  How was I positive  I didn’t have the symptoms on the news, I got cleared by a doctor, and no one cared. ..at customs I had come from a high risk country. I guess why I’m telling you all of this is because what they are telling you are symptoms are not ALL symptoms. And you do NOT have to have the symptoms to be positive. The only symptom I had that was similar was a fever. Julia said she didnapost know how she had been infected.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":null,"title":"oil workers in isolation on north sea rigs after showing coronavirus symptoms","story":"An oil company has confirmed more than a dozen suspected cases of cornavirus on two of its s.North Sea operator Taqa said that eight crew members are currently under self-isolation on its Cormorant Alpha and North Cormorant rigs.Number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Tayside now at  as death toll rises\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp number-of-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-in-tayside-now-at--as-death-toll-rises embed # secretyokLxFe\" data-secret\"yokLxFe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"A further five workers have show minor symptoms and are nearing the end of their self-isolation period, a spokesman for the firm said.The eight crew members are due to be flown on shore tomorrow.All affected crew members are currently being treated by medics on the s, the firm said.Dundee council cancels house repairs and closes headquarters as city battles coronavirus pandemic\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-council-cancels-house-repairs-and-closes-headquarters-as-city-battles-coronavirus-pandemic embed # secretcHxHqelyYV\" data-secret\"cHxHqelyYV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-gorbals-vampire-stalked-city-streets","story":"IT HAS gone down in history as one of the most spine-chilling moments in Glasgowrsquos ghoulish past."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-slam-fly-tippers-mess-left-port-glasgow-street","story":"ANGRY residents are calling for housing bosses to step in and remove rubbish dumped in a Port Glasgow street."},{"url":null,"title":"john-lewis-shut-50-stores-due-coronavirus-pandemic","story":"John Lewis Partnership has made the ldquodficult decision to temporarily close all  John Lewis shopsas a result of the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-garngad-takeaway-goes-flames","story":"A Glasgow takeaway has been forced to shut after the ground floor went up in flames on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-says-parks-not-full-says-dont-gather-weddings-celebrations","story":"The First Minister has hit out at those flocking to parks and beaches as she announcedthe government advice on preventing the spread of coronavirus is \"not optional\"."},{"url":null,"title":"janice-bell-pans-people-pussycat-dolls","story":"LAST weekend eight of us descended on Arran for a girlsrsquo weekend.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

Patsy Dyer will speak on #Man#s Relationship and Mythology with Plants#, drawing on her work at botanical gardens in America, the UK and Kilmartin."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part five","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Mate had gone below when the sails came down and very shortly after we had anchored we sat down to a supper of lamb salad, strawberry tarts, coffee and biscuits. As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

Sometimes he appears concerned and snuggles into my side, others he drops his ball into my lap asto say, come play, forget your worries for a while.I adopted Moose from the Dogs Trust in Glasgow last August.

Chocolate-box we arenrsquot. All around are plots so lush and well-tended they could be entered at Cha. Our patch is not in their league. Looking out to hills at the back, it opens onto a field, where sheep huddle at night under a blackthorn by our gate, leaving wisps of wool every morning. Chicken wire intended to keep out rabbits has been gnawed by marauders for whom our mossy, tufty grass is irresistible. Nor can we grow a dense hedge to discourage them because, wersquove been told, the horses who share the field with the sheep would bring our wooden fence crashing down as they leaned over to munch it. And needless to say, nothing can keep out the nettles, which wave wildly at me after itrsquos been raining, like kids on a school bus.Burying myself in a rose catalogue is a definition of day-dreaming.

The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach.

I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdowns-spark-surge-mobile-phone-use","story":"Lockdowns As the virus spreads and governments respond, data shows we are turning more than ever before to our phones for information, work and entertainment and a link to the world.New research from China, the first location of the outbreak, shows that after the city lockdowns began there in January, daily time on mobiles jumped to five hours on average for February - up % compared to the  average.

The scientic community is ided over the best way forward and we are following a particular reading of the science. WHO has consistently advised all countries to test, track and trace every suspected case of the virus. The overwhelming majority of national governments are taking this approach.The UK Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesis the body advising our politicians. As far as I understand, Sage does not believe we can contain the virus using the WHOrsquos methodology. Our Government is, therefore, not making the same effort as others to stop the virus spreading, while attempting to control it in a manner that doesnrsquot put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak. The reason we are testing four times less than Germany is more to do with a dference in approach, rather than an issue of capacity.I am not a scientic authority so my opinion is worth little on this matter. However, the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach is concerning, given the WHOrsquos history in dealing with virus outbreaks. What I find alarming is the lack of discussion, and seeming lack of knowledge, about the path we are on.We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. ldquoWe know best ndash trust us will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn, time is of the essence and so much is at stake.Much of what we usually do has become irrelevant in these extraordinary times. Conversely, this situation demands us to be well informed about certain things most of us would normally have little interest in. A widespread understanding of how our Government is trying to tackle this coronavirus is crucial to overcoming it.Kennedy Stewart, Lerwick.WHILE the Government is to be commended for much of the action taken so far and as the country and the NHS buckles down to cope with possibly then greatest challenge since the Second World War, there is one shut-down whose consequences, I suggest, may not have been fully considered.I refer to that affecting patients suffering from inoperable and incurable cancers, of which I, unfortunately, am one. We have been informed that endoscopy units, where palliative care such as periodically burning of the growth with lasers takes place, have been closed indefinitely.Last summer, I was given the bleak prognosis of anything from six months to  months. My cancer was subjected to laser burning and not only do I neither look or feel like a cancer sufferer, my tumour had actually shrunk slightly after my last treatment.There will be, I am sure, many more like me throughout Scotland, people whose le expectancy depends on the success of this treatment and I have no wish to jump any queue. But it seems illogical to me to deny treatment to people who actually need it, so that resources can be erted and reserved for those who might need it.I realise the NHS is and will be under tremendous pressure in the weeks and months to come and that only a minority are thus affected, but surely the Government has a duty of care to us as much as to potential Covid- victims I have been told that the only way I might be treated will beI become an emergency case, i.e.I begin to bleed uncontrollably, or my oesophagus obstructs. By then, I suggest, it may be beyond remedy.Surely, we too are entitled to hope for such le as can be procured for us by this vital treatment to spend with our loved ones.Charles Duncan, Glasgow G.THIS Covid- crisis must surely spell the end of the road for our self-indulgent entitlement society with its emphasis upon the rights of the inidual.Now we must recapture a sense of responsibility and sacrice to protect the community at large.Only today I heard of a shopper displaying the height of irresponsibility in a local supermarket.That person was wandering through the aisles, coughing, sneezing and spluttering while making no attempt to cover nostrils or mouth.Shops would be well advised to put up posters at their entrances in bold, clear type asking customers displaying such symptoms not to enter their stores and to get neighbours to shop for them or order their goods online.Knowing full well that the NHS could well be swamped with so many cases that they will be unmanageable, we may have to adopt the time-honoured custom of women and children first in an emergency.If the hospital system reaches such a breaking point, then priorities about deciding who can be treated successfully will have to come into the equation.These are hard choices but they will have to be taken in the interests of the wider community.The Devil Take The Hindmost and the Irsquom all right Jack mentalities have to be flushed out of our societal systemwe are to survive as a species.This pandemic is but one manestation of where responsibilities need to take precedence over rights.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.WHILE there has been justied criticism of panic buyers and hoarders in the current Coronavirus emergency, there is another type whose activities are even more deserving of the publicrsquos scorn, namely the profiteers.Yesterday, when we were down our last bar of our preferred soap, Imperial Leather, I idly browsed eBay. Prices for this soap ied from around pound a bar, not unreasonable, to pound for six, to three figures for the same, but as far as pound, for six bars. It seems that some scabrous Thatcherites are cashing in on the shortages that they have helped to create. At the same time online footage of a tearful nurse at the end of a y sht gazing at supermarket shelves picked clean by ldquolocusts arouses our indignation. While Kevin McKennawrites in hope that the current emergency may bring out the best in our citizenry, the evidence seems to suggest the reverse. Forty years of neo-liberalist doctrines backed by successive Conservative governments are reaping their grim harvest.Similar outbreaks of profiteering occurred at the beginning of both world wars and eventually the governments of the day, deciding that ldquothe market was not sacrosanct, introduced rationing. While this may be an over-reaction at this point, eBay should consider action to prevent leeches taking advantage of the short-term misery of health and other key workers.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.MANY thanks and congratulations to Tom Gordon for his article ldquoDeath was doing the rounds long before the virus arrived . The statistics he provides are a much-needed reality check on the current Covid situation and should give us all pause for reflection.Jessie Reid, Dalry.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WHEN anti-coronavirus measures are being considered, may I ask for the importance of walking for exercise for the sake of onersquos health to be taken on board It seems to be that ldquostay at home is being used as meaning the same as ldquodonrsquot mix with others, but they arenrsquot equivalent. The latter is highly desirable, but there is no need to stay at home to walk in the countryside or along a canal, where the risk of catching or spreading infection would appear to be negligible.People need exercise as well as dogs. As a dogless walker, I have the experience of being looked at strangely because I walk without a dog.Paul Brownsey, Bearsden.HAVING failed to be able to buy contributions for the food bank at a supermarket I wonderthey could set up an online contribution service. People could even select from a list of items most needed at food banks, pay, and the items could be kept behind thescenes to be distributed directly as a priority.Elizabeth Allen, Glasgow G.THANK you so such much for your very moving front pageldquoWhen yoursquore on your own, we are there with you and the words signed by your editor, Donald Martin.

Nobody could have predicted the scale of the devastation, both socially and economically, wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. With large swathes of the economy essentially forced to shut up shop for months - and faced by the quick and unied action of the trade unions - Mr Sunak was left with little alternative but to make this unprecedented intervention, the like of which was not even seen in wartime, and which will almost certainly end up dwarfing the bank bailout of  by comparison.By forcing the Conservative government into a corner on this state intervention, the pandemic has also forced them to admit some truths that many would rather stayed hidden. Large-scale borrowing is possible. Citizens can be bailed out, not just banks and business. There can be support when things go wrong. Therersquos always been enough to go round.These are truths that have long been scoffed at when those on the left tried to highlight them - most recently Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour Party in last yearrsquos General Election which, unbelievably, took place just three months ago. Plans for wide-ranging nationalisation, the abolishment of tuition fees and free broadband for all were made a laughing stock of by opposition politicians and establishment media alike, whose taunting most often took some form of the question ldquohow are you going to pay for that Many will remember the BBCrsquos Emma Barnett mockingly asking Angela Raynerthe party wanted to nationalise sausages it wasnrsquot necessary for the Conservative Chancellor to specically mention meat-based products in last weekrsquos announcement when he essentially nationalised almost every industry in the country in one quick sweep.When former prime minister Theresa May infamously remarked that ldquothere isnrsquot a magic money tree we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want, it was in response to a nurse whose pay had been frozen for eight years and who was struggling to survive on her wage. If it seemed callous at the time, it seems unthinkable in the current moment. Not only does the magic money tree exist, underpaid nurses and their like should be first in line to shake it.Because while Mr Sunak deserves few platitudes for doing the only thing possible and conscionable under current circumstances, he will surely be credited with changing politics forever. Now wersquove seen that money can be borrowed to help those in need, how can we ever justy leaving people homeless on the streets  Now we know therersquos no limit on the cost of state intervention, why should anyone struggling ever have to pay for childcare  When itrsquos clear that political will is all that stands between poverty and the spending of trillions of pounds, how can we ever look at a foodbank again The genie is out of the bottle: the free market is not infallible or inevitable ending inequality is possible. Things can never be the same again.Of course, this is not the utopia that any on the left would wish for. Short-term crisis response is not an ideology, and nor is the maintained concentration of the levers of power with a small group of politicians socialism. But the scale of intervention pledged by Sunak cannot be overstated or removed from its context in history: in the UK, in our letimes and beyond, we have never seen the likes of it.Coronavirus has already put immense strain on the worldrsquos citizens and the global economy, with far worse expected to come. Praise for Mr Sunak has been widespread across the political and media class since his announcement, with many who have long sneered at ldquoCorbynomics lauding the Chancellor for his decisive leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-costa-coffee-nandos-temporarily-close-outlets","story":"The chicken chain said in a statement on its website on Sunday that all  stores will shut ldquountil further notice, with takeaway and delivery services also suspended.The company, which employs around , people, said it is working closely with its teams across the UK to ldquomake sure that everybody affected is supported during the coming weeks.Lots of love, Nandorsquos # pic OxIGVeUSldquoEat in, takeaway and delivery for customers will all stop until further notice and our remaining food will be given away to those who need it most across the community.A statement posted on its Twitter account said it would try to keep cafes open in hospitals, with NHS staff to receive free coffee for the next two weeks.The coffee chain said staff at closed stores will be paid their full average weekly pay over eight weeks.:Ferry services to no-longer take non-essential travellersIt comes after McDonaldrsquos announced all of its restaurants in the UK and Ireland will close by pm on Monday to protect the safety of its employees and customers.The fast-food chain, which has , employees in the UK and Ireland, posted a statement about the ldquodficult decision to Twitter ndash adding that stores will close by that time on Monday ldquoat the latest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-health-secretary-blasts-snp-colleague-ignoring-distancing-rules","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly stressed that social distancing rules are \"not optional\" and must be followed.She has now called on all politicians to physically close their constituency offices and lead by example.SNP MSP John Mason posted on Twitter that his Glasgow Shettleston constituency office will remain open, despite the social distancing advice issued by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoMy staff and I are keen to be as available as possible to constituentsso wersquore keeping our office open Monday to Friday, am ndash pm.ldquoAll my surgeries will now be in my office.

We also have a dferent legal situation in Scotland pertaining to rights of access.It will closeall holiday let properties and cancelling bookings to the end of April, with the situation to be revised further in coming weeks.And it is asking people not to travel to its island properties in order to protect communities.The Trust had previously announced that it would leave some gardens, grounds and parkland open for free access during the crisis.The NTS said: \"The decision to go ahead with a blanket closure follows in the light of calls by the Scottish Government for people to suspend unnecessary travel, especially to more remote areas, and for the owners of all hotels, BBs and self-catering accommodation to close.\"The decision was also influenced by a busy weekend at some properties where social distancing guidance was not being followed and the potential threat to the wellbeing to both visitors and the Trustrsquos staff this was causing.\"The NTS is cancelling all holiday let bookings up until at least  April, and will extend thisneeded. The charity has also said that it will not accept any new bookings for stays before  June, again with this date subject to review.Trust staff are contacting people who have made bookings to offer alternative dates in the future, a voucher that can be exchanged for up to a year ahead, ornecessary a full refund.The National Trust for Scotlandrsquos chief executive, Simon Skinner said: ldquoAs I have said before, our absolute priority is to ensure the wellbeing of our visitors and workforce. It is this that has led us to todayrsquos very dficult decision.ldquoTo support non-essential travel instruction, we are closing all our remaining open properties, including gardens, grounds and country parks along with our car parks and holiday let properties. I am truly sorry for the disappointment and inconvenience this is causing but for the safety of our visitors, volunteers and staff this is the right course of action.ldquoWe are already in touch with those affected to rearrange holidays and events.ldquoThe Trust is also asking people not to travel to our island properties at this time, albeit that this is dficult due to ferry restrictions in any case. We were aware of the serious concerns of residents in places like Canna and Fair Isle, which are remote from healthcare provision and especially vulnerable. For their sakes, no-one should travel to island communities unless it is on essential business.ldquoWhile this is a very dficult time, the National Trust for Scotland is carrying on with its vital work of protecting and conserving Scotlandrsquos irreplaceable heritage.

Testing more patients would increase the ldquodenominator ndash the number of people who have a positive coronavirus test. For a given number of deaths, this is likely to have the effect of pushing down the mortality rate, according to Duncan Young, professor of intensive care medicine at Oxford University.He suggests an alternative approach might be to compare death rates for cases of equal severity ndash for example, patients in Italy and the UK who show the same level of sickness when admitted to hospital or an intensive care unit. Were these figures available, Prof Young says they might give ldquoa very crude estimate of the quality overload of the care system. Any dference could, however, also be due to dferences in patient characteristicsbetween UK and Italy.ndash Evolution of outbreakAnother way of measuring the UK against Europe is to consider the evolution of the outbreak and see whether the country is mirroring the trend of another country ndash possibly by a particular number of days or weeks.On March , the number of reported cases in Italy was , ndash similar to the number of reported cases in the UK on March  .The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Italy on March  was  ndash again, similar to the number for the UK on March  .The figures suggest the UK seems to be running around two weeks behind Italy and might therefore reach the equivalent number of cases and deaths in a fortnight.But while the evolution of the outbreak in the UK ndash as measured by confirmed cases ndash is broadly following the same shape as that in Italy, it is impossible to predictthe trajectory will be identical. Overall numbers might be masking important dferences in the ages of coronavirus cases and victims, as well as the dference in testing regimes, all of which might influence the pace and scope of the outbreakrsquos development in the UK over the next few weeks.ndash Age of victimsProfessor Sheila Bird, former programme leader of the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, suggests another approach: aligning countries on the basis of the evolution of the outbreak and then, for each age group, comparing the number of deaths per million of population.ldquoThe starkness of the increase in relative death rates by age group that we have seen in other countries is why the UK seeks to protect those aged over  years from becoming exposed to Covid-, she says.Based on , deaths in Italy, and considering the age distribution of the Italian population, Prof Bird found that death rate per million of population appears to be ldquofour times higher at - years than at - years  times higher at - years  times higher per million of population at - years than at - years and around  times higher per million of population at -plus years than at - years.She notes that in ldquojust a few weeks, sadly, the UK will be able to estimate these rates for its own population ndash which will then help give a more detailed picture of how the UK compares with some of its European neighbours."},{"url":null,"title":"foreign-office-urges-british-travellers-return-home-immediately---can","story":"The department warned that international travel was becoming highly limited with the further closure of air routes, land borders and domestic restrictions introduced daily.It is advising British travellers to contact their tour operator or airline now.

Link listed below I agree, I think we should all be tested. The government needs to put that into place, especially for people that have other illnesses going on too!Shetlands are relatively lucky in terms of the likelihood of local diasaster arising from COVID . All the more informed comparisons show that large urban and industrial areas with regional or national borders that are dficult to control, may be ones with good facilities but are also ones where this virus spreads quite quickly. In such places, even a move to zero new infections as in and around Hebei, China is no measure of safety, because ing citizens will endanger a second wave of infection.Prof Ian Inkster, SOAS, London.The first thing I think we need to do is to stop people travelling in and out of the islands on boats and planes, we would all be in a safer position when that has been tackled. People here in Shetland can help minimise the spread by doing what we have been doing, staying away from crowds and only travelling when necessary. As for shopping, it would helpthe likes of the CO-OP and Tesco delivered to people while this situation is ongoing. Obviously they will need extra staff to carry out this task. Tesco I know already do deliveries, but I know of people that have tried ordering from them and have been told they cannot get a delivery for over a fortnight.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  .

Those who need their prescription are asked to queue in an orderly fashion.n Those who are feeling unwell – especially with a cough or fever are asked to NOT come to the pharmacy but to contact their GP or call the NHS  number.n Coopers will be closed from pm-pm to allow appropriate disinfecting of all its surfaces and to allow a dedicated break for staff.n If collecting prescriptions please telephone ahead to ensure the prescription has been received and will be prepared for collection.Michael said that he, along with staff, appreciated the kind sentiments already shown by their customers.“We would ask that they continue to show support and encourage our hard working pharmacy teams.“There is and will continue to be huge pressure on us.

At St Anne#s Square, home to the MAC theatre, a hotel, a gym and many restaurants, padlocks are on gates and signs inform of closure because of the threat of Covid-.

Firms in Northern Ireland offering such services could include PwC or Grant Thornton.Lord Empey noted that while there have been a series of announcements in recent days from the Chancellor and Executive offering help, many of these schemes have not been fully worked out, and many of our small businesses are immediately starved of cash with forced closures and no customers.The peer added: I think it would be helpfulInvest NI, working with the Department for the Economy, drew up a scheme to offer professional help to these businesses and iniduals to help guide people though the complexity of what is on offer. Such a scheme could give grants to these firms to engage accountants and business advisers on the best way forward for them and to help them establish what help they can apply for.I would also ask that the main accountancy bodies... would undertake this work at as modest a cost as possible, making this their contribution to the restoration of our economy. Now is the time to act. It will cost less in the end than having to pay out vast amounts of unemployment and other benefits in the future.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus: Ulster Hospital consultant in online plea as she warns huge numbers could diepeople do not heed adviceIn a hard-hitting video posted on Twitter at the weekend, Ulster Hospital respiratory consultant Dr Julia Courtney spelled out the scale of the looming healthcare disaster facing Northern Ireland and its people, warning that huge numbers of people will die.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Northern Ireland NHS chiefs call on private hospitals to provide helpHealth bosses in Northern Ireland have appealed to private hospitals to help them in the fight to save lives during the coronavirus crisis.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Calls to get tougher on social distancing after second death in Northern IrelandPressure is mounting for stronger legislation to enforce social distancing as a second person died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-.VideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: Social distancing plea by boy with cancer as he bids to avoid infectionStay at home - don#t send me back to intensive care.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus updates: A matter of le or death, follow advice, send workers home or risk #wave of deaths#, urges FosterIt#s love at a distance as well-known Northern Ireland faces mark a Mother#s Day like no otherMan who died after Co Antrim stabbing named Community in shock after death of motorcyclist Andrew BrowningThree men arrested after gardai find a bomb factory in disused quarry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The UCD QUB research paper, called #Symbols and Labels: children#s awareness of social categories in a ided society#, is published in the Journal of Community Psychology.Speaking to the Belfastlast night, lead researcher Dr Laura K Taylor said: How and when children develop an understanding of group boundaries has implications for conflict resolution.She hoped the research would inform education policy and teaching in Northern Ireland.Our research is trying to help understand what it means for children to grow up in a post-accord society. Children today did not grow up in a violent society, so how do they learn about it These findings suggest that, by late childhood, children in Northern Ireland can readily identy and associate symbols with their hypothesised social categories.Separate school systems, as well as strong family networks and homogeneous lestyles, shape children#s cultural awareness, the researchers suggest.The UCD QUB research echoes a  study for the Community Relations Council, which found children as young as three were able to recognise symbols as being linked to either loyalist or nationalist cultures.That earlier study - carried out by the University of Ulster - found that by the age of six, % of the more than three hundred children surveyed could identy flags and parades as belonging to one #side# or the other.

I think she would#ve preferred a more secure occupation, Holly said.Now a regular on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Holly praised Kim online after opting to stay in England with husband, Co Armagh broadcaster Connor Phillips, due to the coronavirus.Dates like Mother#s Day are always dficult as it#s a reminder that we can#t just pop round to see our family when we want to! I always make sure the card arrives on time, though... I wouldn#t hear the end of it otherwise!Although my parents are both healthy and in their s, it#s so important to take every possible precaution, she said.It#s about maintaining the spread and not being anywhere we don#t have to be.Asked what traits she inherited from the former journalist, Holly joked she missed out on her physique.We#re both quite stubborn, enjoy a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and are never wrong, she said.People say we look alike, but sadly I didn#t get her legs!Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and Rossa FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCarl Frampton, we Christine and children Carla and RossaProving that boxers are more than just a tough exterior, Belfast sportsman Carl Frampton hailed his we for all she does for their family.Carlshares Carlaand Rossawith Christine , who he wed in .Alongside a holiday snap with his brood, the former two-weight world champion wrote: Happy Mother#s Day to the mother of our kids.

If it#s hard not to see her for a few days or weeks, it would be unbearable to not have her in my le anymore. She is particularly susceptible to the virus and it could have devastating consequences for her. So as hard as this is for all of us, it#s so important we do all we can to ensure she is kept safe.Mum is still relatively young, I want her to be around for a lot, lot longer!Claire credits Karen for passing on her sense of fun, her caring nature and for teaching her to be a good listener.For many of us, Sunday was a chance to shower our mums with love and flowers, but for some it brings a painful longing for the women who are no longer with us.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaniel Baker and his late mother Edna FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaniel Baker and his late mother EdnaJust eight months after losing his own mother, Belfast Lord Mayor Daniel Baker said he would love nothing more than to show her his appreciation.The Sinn Fein councillor took up the role of First Citizen last December.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We are publishing extracts from the book. In this latest article, Brian examines what the local area was like in the Bronze Age.   One Autumn’s day in  a local farmer ploughing his hill-top field, overlooking the River Foyle, hooked a large flat stone, of dimensions  feet by  feet, and brought it to the surface.There it remained while the winter’s frosts worked to break up the soil.It was members of Shantallow Local History Society, out searching for flint fragments, the evidence of prehistoric settlement, who on coming across this large flat stone realised it was perhaps the capping stone of a Bronze Age grave.The Archaeological Branch of the Department of the Environment was called in, who, on one very wet March day in , carried out an emergency dig.Small village What they found convinced them that here in the townland of Shantallow, on the fringe of the present-day city of Derry, in the early years of the second millennium BC, lived a small village community of farmers who had trade connections with the flint-mining areas of County Antrim, and who in a nearby cemetery buried their dead.The stone which had lain undisturbed for some , years was, in fact, the capping stone of a cist tomb.Around , BC a circular pit,  to  feet deep, had been dug on the brow of a small hill,  feet above the River Foyle.In the middle of this pit slabs of stone had been laid on edge to create a stone box,  feet long by  feet wide.The corpse, with his or her knees folded up to its chest, had been placed in this coffin on its side.Rotted awayOnly part of the skull and part of the leg bone remained of this skeleton, as the rest of the body had rotted away through contact with the soil.Behind the neck of the corpse was an earthenware pot in the shape of a bowl and decorated with jagged imprints.This bowl had been made specically for the burial ceremony.It is clear that these people believed in some form of afterle, as the bowl would have been filled with food or drink to sustain the body after death in the journey through the underworld.The cist in which the corpse lay was then roofed with a capstone. In this case, as occurred on other sites, the grave wasn’t marked above the ground with a mound of earth.The farmer had inadvertently uncovered on this hill-top site a Bronze Age cemetery.Short cistThis distinctive form of burial, in a short cist with an upright bowl-shaped food vessel, is not unique to Ireland.It has been found all over Europe, even as far east as Russia. It represents the spread of the so-called Beaker peoples, named after their pottery, who originated in lands around the mouth of the Rhine, then spread to Northern Britain and from there to Ireland. Around the early years of the second millennium they had reached Shantallow.These people were settled pastoralists who introduced metal-working into Ireland.Near the cist in Shantallow fragments of flint, which is not a native rock of this area, were found, and the area of their greatest concentration marked the spot where a small community lived.Shantallow clearly supported a Bronze Age village.The flints were fashioned to be used as arrowheads and thumbscrapers.The arrowheads would have been used in hunting while the thumb-shaped flint scrapers would have been used in the preparation of animal skins before they were cured.Clothes would have been made from this leather.No metal artefacts were found, but in other cist burials hundreds of metal implements have been found.Ireland possessed abundant supplies of copper, and these people exploited in a large way Irish copper and gold, as evidenced by the metal axes, knives and daggers they left behind.Their most outstanding personal ornament was the sheet-gold lanula, a crescent-shaped neck ornament.The settlers at Shantallow were primarily livestock farmers.With their metal axes they would have begun to clear some of the surrounding forest to expose good pasture land. Here cattle were grazed for their beef.They would also have grown wheat, oats and barley, with the grain being ground on saddle-querns.Within an earth enclosure, perhaps topped with a palisade of timber stakes, the early inhabitants of Shantallow would have lived in small, single-room, circular wicker huts.Their houses were probably built of posts and wattle rods.Thin saplingsStrong posts were driven into the ground, and thin saplings of hazel, elm or ash were woven between them to form the walls. Then the walls were plastered with daub in which mud was mixed with straw.This mixture dried very hard to create a sturdy homestead.The roofs would have been thatched with straw or rushes obtained from marshy ground.Our early settlers at Shantallow would have only made a small impact on the forests which clothed this area.Only the hill top would have been cleared of wood.On a clear day, rising above the trees that swept down to the banks of the Foyle on both sides of the river, the early dwellers of Shantallow might have spotted, some two miles to the south-east across the river, smoke curling up from open hearths on Rough Island in Enagh Lough.FragmentsFinds of late Stone Age and Bronze Age pottery fragments on this island, lying almost in the middle of the lake, roughly circular in shape, with a diameter of  feet and now largely overgrown with trees and shrubs, identies this as a settlement site around the same time as the community of Shantallow were burying one of their members.This site on Enagh Lough, termed a crannog, was formed by a  of timber, overlain with a layer of packed stones almost  feet deep, being placed, timber by timber and stone by stone, on top of a marshy island created by glacial dumping during the last Ice Age.Bronze spearheads, flint flakes and abraded stones, worn away by man’s rubbing or scraping, attest to its settlement in prehistoric times.Around the edge of the crannog there may have been a defensive palisade of timber stakes with lighter branches of wattle woven in and out through them.Very similarThe houses inside, built of wicker, wattling and daub, and the lestyle would have been very similar to those at Shantallow.Barley, wheat and oat impressions found on the pottery fragments are evidence of the cultivation of these crops in fields around the shore of Enagh Lough.In addition to farming their own food, the inhabitants here exploited the fish and fowl associated with a small lake.No names or even exact dates can be identied against these Bronze Age settlers of the Derry area.But we do know that they did exist, and that they began man’s first tentative exploitation and alteration of the local environment. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We can still go out when we need to for groceries and the like, so there is no need to panic. Why not take the opportunity to binge on a few Netflix series . Our suggestions below arent necessarily suitable for younger viewers but will keep adults enthralled for sure. The Stranger Probably the top trending Netflix series so far this year and for good reason. Harlen Cobens latest creation shows a strange woman turn up in a British community to reveal the secrets of the inhabitants. The resultant human wrangling and mystery makes this one of those series where one more episode is never enough. The tying of those secrets together as the series unfolds reveals a lot more about the locals than they care to admit and uncovers a murky underbelly. This is a must-watch. googletag.cmd.push Marcella Anna Friel is exceptional in this Nordic-inspired British crime drama. She plays a run-ragged detective who finds herself central to the murder mysteries shes investigating. The edge-of-the-seat drama entailed in the unravelling of the story in each of the two stories is truly gripping. This is a well-acted and produced ITV drama that might have slipped under the radar for many. With two series and  episodes available on Netflix, there is plenty to binge on. Unforgotten Another ITV production starring the brilliant Nicola Walker. This series sees a team of detectives re-opening cold cases following the discovery of new information. They endeavour to reach back in time and across generations to dig up old evidence and connections. The result is another brilliantly gripping drama with a new story taking centre stage in each of the two series available on Netflix. It is fast-paced and written in a way that puts you in the investigation room, often shouting at the TV with nuggets of information youve spotted in previous episodes. A third series has aired but has not yet reached the streaming service. googletag.cmd.push Safe Another Harlen Coben creation which has seen an increase in traffic since the success of The Stranger, although Safe appeared on Netflix first last year. Coben specialises in writing a big story within the context of a small community and this is the ultimate example. A teenage girl goes missing from her home in a gated community, and her fathers desperate search brings him into a dark world. Suspicion falls on almost everyone and this series will have you second-guessing every word out of every characters mouth. The Trials Of Gabriel Fernandez This true-crime documentary is perhaps the most disturbing of these suggestions but is compelling viewing. It charts the story of nine-year-old Gabriel Fernandez and his gruesome death at the hands of his mother and her partner. The abuse he suffered sparks a wide-ranging investigation. That investigation and this series shines a light on something far more sinister and systematic than the abuse in Gabriels own home. It will make you feel very uneasy but you will not be able to stop watching, wide-eyed with shock.

Blade Runner A truly classic science fiction filmdirected byRidley Scott and starringHarrison Ford,Rutger HauerandSean Young. The Crying Game Neil Jordan’s  hit was a success at the time and it boasts one of the most surprising twists in the tail in any film. googletag.cmd.push GoodFellas Martin Scorsese’s  masterpiece is a must watch film about the Mafia with an all star cast including Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. GroundhogDay A brilliant  comedy where Bill Murray relives the same day over and over again.... Funny and fitting for the situation we find ourselves in. Jaws A classic and the music alone makes it worth watching. The Silence of the Lambs Not one for the kids.... and probably not one for some adults either. T Four Weddings and a Funeral A rom-com starring Hugh Grant and a theme song that launched a thousand first dances at weddings. googletag.cmd.push When Harry Met Sally Famous for THAT scene and a cracking comedy all round The Le of Brian Once banned in this country, it is still hilarious to this day and signs off with a tune fitting for the times we are in now.

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time. The hammer blow came in the thminute, with Bellaghys goal. Cassidy and Gavin Diamond combined to put Cathal Scullion through, unmarked, to score the goal that ended their losing run in finals.

Just last week, the Judges Road club were preparing for their All-Ireland League game with Sundays Well, hoping for a win which would take them away from relegation uncertainty and into a potential play-off position near the top of Division C. But the worldwide events of the past few days have not only ended sport locally, nationally and beyond, it has also put any game into context, with peoples lives at risk because of the spread of the Covid- virus.Rather than sit around and wait for the latest news however, City of Derry Head Coach Paul OKane, his staff and his players have made a public offer to go out into the community to help in anyway needed. OKane himself has already been out delivering groceries and prescriptions to the most vulnerable unable to travel in a bid to keep them safe during these uncertain times. “Its just something that we thought we would like to do,” he explained. “I spoke with the president and I spoke with the vice-chair of rugby, and there have been plenty of the players who have stuck their hands up. Were all at a bit of a loose end now and we know that theres vulnerable people out there and to be honest theres been a very good response. “Its certainly opened my eyes to how vulnerable in particular the old people are, even for simple things such as getting their shopping done or getting their prescriptions done and weve been out and about getting a few things done today. I think its just important we try and do something.”The importance of sport to the local community has never been more evident than in recent days with most sporting events and clubs taking a necessary step backwards. Sport however, can still give back, according to OKane.“Were really an extended family when you see how far and wide it reaches and people maybe dont realise that sometimes because were so erse,” he continued. “Were here for the whole community, were cross community, were cross-border and we have people involved in the club travelling from everywhere. “Its just important to try and help anyone we can, eventheyre not attached to the club, eventheyre just a part of the city or wider area. “We have players from Inishowen, Letterkenny, Strabane and Limavady, and from both sides of the water in Derry itself. We have footprints on every side of the community here. This is the least we can do for the wider rugby family in the city and the city in general.”It could be weeks or even months before the sporting calendar resumes, but in the meantime, OKane is hoping that the crisis will bring out the best of our community.“Its not just rugby because Im a Derry City fan and I try to get to every game I can,” he said. “Im from a gaelic background as well. I helped coach Doire Colmcille and Im originally a Limavady Wolfhound, so its great to see all those wee communities trying to do their bit, and were a part of that. “Were at a bit of a loss at what we do at the minute so we have to try and make the best of it and help whoever needs help and try to rally around. From a sporting point of view, you dont know what you have until youve lost it. “Its crazy how much it affects us, evenits sitting watching sport or going training. Some of the guys are going out of their mind because they cant train. Its been massively impactful and when we get back at it, I think we will appreciate things a lot more.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time. Whether its ignorance or not taking it seriously, over the next couple of weeks there will be no option but to take it seriously because I think its going to start getting serious here.” googletag.cmd.push LethalThe virus can be lethal to older people and those with underlying health conditions and McCourt urged the young people of the city to think about who they could come in contact with.“For young people who are fit and healthy its probably not going to affect them inidually but its who they can pass it onto is the worrying thing,” he continued. “Our club doctortold us that we probably could train and evenone of our lads contracted it, it probably wouldnt do much harm, but its about who he would then take it on and spread it to. That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home. Seamus McCallion has managed to get all the players a GPS unit where they can still work out at home and they can download it and email it to him and then he reports back to us as a staff. In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis. The majority of people are taking it seriously but there is an element, in my opinion, who arent taking it as seriously as they should be.” googletag.cmd.push EncouragementMcCourt has been involved in football for most of his le and whilst temptation to get outside may be there whilst the sun is shining, McCourt encouraged the young sports people of the city to act responsibly to look after their physical and mental health as well as others.“At the minute were still not in complete lock-down, we can still go out, you can still get a ball and knock it up against the wall and do keep-ups. You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department. If symptoms worsen during home isolation or you are no better after seven days, seek medical advice by telephone.Those with an underlying health condition and who develop symptoms are advised to let their GP know and only only call  in an emergency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Catholic.jpg","title":"Catholic Principals’ Association calls on Education Minister to close schools  ","story":"AT least three schools in the district have confirmed they pupils who may have been exposed to coronavirus.The closure of all schools appears likely within days as pressure mounts on Education Minister Peter Weir to follow the example of the Irish government and close all schools and colleges.Mr Weir ruled out full-out closure on Monday, but yesterday the Catholic Principalsrsquo Association, called for an immediate closure of all schools.First Minister Arlene Foster indicated that the closure could last for up to four months.All school principals and teachers have been working hard to protect pupils this week in the face of the coronavirus threat.Any planned parent teacher evenings have been cancelled and many schools are restricting access into the school apart from staff and students.Many schools have taken exceptional closure days on Monday and from tomorrow to Friday to allow teachers time to prepare lesson packs for students as well as preparing for online lesson sessions in the anticipation of closure.These include De La Salle High School and St Brigidrsquos Primary School in Downpatrick. St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

Yet, when the crisis lands on our collective doorstepsour reaction will probably be fairly similar to this from Alexander McCall Smith:‘The unexpected always happens in the way‘The unexpected has always occurred:Le after the coronavirus willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel : Press Eye Ltd \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...‘While we were doing something ,‘While we are thinking of altogether‘Dferent things – matters that events‘Then show to be every bit as unimportant‘As our human concerns so often are.’For me, aged  and part of that older generation which seems to be at greater risk from Covid-, my immediate reaction was, ‘I thought I would have had more time.’ We all take risks every day driving our car through rush-hour traffic, boarding a plane, climbing a mountain, taking part in some particularly physical sports, tripping over a kerbstone, falling from a ladder. There are also health risks a stroke, heart attack, diagnosis of a crippling disease, onset of cancer, dementia, paralysis.But to some extent all of those are calculated risks. We consider the evidence: yes, we could be killed in a car or plane crash, or break our spine in a rugby scrum. But the calculations are almost always in our favour and we take the risk. And in most circumstancessomething very bad happens, short of death, there is a health service and after-care service to help. But what happens when the calculations are no longer in your favour  What happens when the chances of something potentially le-threatening happening to you rise above % to as high as % – maybe even higher  What happens when you suddenly realise that tens of thousands of people will certainly die, with many thousands of others left with long-term heart and lung complications  What happens when your freedom of movement is restricted for months on end and you have to acknowledge that either you, a member of the family living in the house with you, or someone from your wider circle of family and friends is likely to die  It makes you think about le, doesn’t it  Makes you think about what really matters to you, too, doesn’t it I have accepted that I will probably get Covid- within the next few months: it sort of goes with the territory of being an older dad with young children . And having accepted that I’m likely to get it – as well as accepting that the odds of survival are not comfortably in my favour – I’ve also realised that too much of my le has been wasted in pfling arguments and petty political point-scoring. There were so many things I planned to do when I was , yet haven’t done. All the books I planned to write, but didn’t. All the adventures I’d planned in my head –and yet that’s where they stayed.Most of all, though, I think of Kerri and the children. The last  years have been the happiest of my le. I desperately, desperately hope to still be here when this crisis subsides – as all crises eventually do –only to spend more time with my children. The books, adventures and politics don’t, in the great scheme of things, seem to matter anymore. I’d push them all aside just to know I could be with Lilah, Indy, Megan and Kerrifor a few more years. All le ends, I know that. But, to be brutally honest, I’d be mighty pissed-off to be pushed off this mortal coil by a virionwhich measures just billionths of a metre across.The good news – much more important, of course, than my own personal hopes – is that most of us will survive. Le willto an even keel, evenit turns out to be a dferent keel. The next few months will teach us unexpected things about ourselves, not least of which is the frailty of our very existence and the recognition that something which isn’t even visible to the naked eye is, in terms of destructive power, potentially more dangerous than a war or nuclear bomb. It sees everyone and anyone as a potential target. And even when we get some sort of control over the present virus, there will be another one along at some point.One thing we’ll maybe learn from all of this is, that as a species, we survive together or not at all. I don’t actually mean that in a political sense – because there will always be dferences but it is now clear that certain battles require global responses and global cooperation. We seem to have been caught on the hop with Covid- and we must do our best to ensure we’re never caught on the hop again. On a personal note let me wish all of you the very best over the next few months. Do your best to stay safe and healthy. It will be dficult for all of us and for dferent reasons. But one thing I have noticed – and it gives me enormous hope, evenI’m not about – is that there is a bedrock of inidual compassion, concern, kindness and courage that we don’t see often enough when we think things are ok. I’ll leave you with another few lines from McCall Smith:‘We wait, knowing that when this is over,‘A lot of us – not all perhaps –but most,‘Will be slightly dferent people,‘And our world, though diminished,‘Will be much bigger, its beauty revealed afresh.’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.

But people must take action now. pic YdgBItBeFmdash Arlene FosterMarch , Mr Swann has already warned that , people could die in the regionsteps are not taken to limit the spread of Covid .He confirmed the imminent introduction of restrictions as another  cases were announced in the region. There are now  confirmed diagnoses in Northern Ireland, with two people having died.Emergency powers passing through Westminster on Monday are expected to be formally introduced in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, after MLAs vote on a legislative consent motion tabled by Mr Swann.The minister said while some further preparations would be required before the powers were used, he did expect to see them rolled out this week.ldquoWhen we see the response of some people in the general public itrsquos whatrsquos actually needed here in Northern Ireland, and wersquoll have to enforce that, he said.ldquoThose draconian measures will save lives ndash itrsquos as simple as that.ldquoThis isnrsquot something we can wait weeks on, this isnrsquot something that we will wait many days on. These are measures thatwe use now, use constructively, we can really have an impact here on Northern Ireland and save lives.Health minister @RobinSwannMoH says \"draconian\" restrictions on movement in NI will be introduced this week.

I think itrsquos important that we communicate this in a sensible way to the public because people will be afraid when they hear the word lsquolock-downrsquo.ldquoSo when we move there, and we will have to move there, then we will have to communicate that in a very sensitive way, explaining very well to the public and thatrsquos what we are going to do.Stormontrsquos leaders again urged people not to stockpile food and said progress had been made to secure extra personal protection equipmentfor health care staff..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Draconian movement restrictions needed to tackle Covid-, Swann says article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
