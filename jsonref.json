But after ransacking the shop and drinking a bottle of tequila left on the premises after a member of staff’s birthday, the burglars were caught by police in the store’s kitchen drinking prosecco. They were subsequently sentenced: one man was jailed for six months the second given 16 weeks, suspended for 12 months.“They had been there for some time,” said bookseller Uli Lenart. “I think they were looking for cash, but when they didn’t find any, they started bringing up computer equipment from the basement. As I went through the shop afterwards, I found an empty bottle of tequila, and an open bottle of prosecco on the kitchen table downstairs. They seemed to have been boozing up mid-burglary, which probably wasn’t the most prudent thing to do.”No books were taken, said Lenart, with the thieves only taking money from the box on the counter where they had been collecting for the LGBT+ youth charity Mosaic. The shop reopened on Monday and was quickly repaired. “We’ve been at the broken windows rodeo before,” Lenart added – the store has been the target of homophobic attacks in the past, the latest of which took place in 2018.At a book launch on Thursday for Sophie Ward’s debut novel, Love and Other Thought Experiments, customers were informed about the break-in. “We explained we were resilient about the whole thing,” said Lenart, “but that we were sad about the money for charity – and we received so many donations we’ve got far more money for Mosaic now than we had before. The positive community response has been wonderful. Customers turning up with bunches of flowers, people dropping off bottles of prosecco, publishers sending us free books and boxes of chocolates. We’ve felt really held and supported, and we’ve found that deeply touching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3938c0fbfdd7b645ba3d64140861f7728ddcff3/1012_518_4712_2828/master/4712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0d7ce9ef60303609ed97a87c807e3f9","title":"feminism feminists tyranny niceness complexity","story":"Today’s thumbs-up, thumbs-down approach to feminism is boring and reductive. It is time to embrace complexityDifficult. It’s a word that rests on a knife-edge: when applied to a woman, it can be admiring, fearful, insulting and dismissive, all at once. In 2016, it was used of Theresa May (she was “a bloody difficult woman,” Ken Clarke said, when she ran for Tory leader). A year later, it gave the US author Roxane Gay the title for her short story collection. The late Elizabeth Wurtzel took “in praise of difficult women” as the strapline for her feminist manifesto in 1998. The book’s main title was, simply, Bitch.The word is particularly pointed since it recurs so often when women talk about the consequences of challenging sexism. The TV presenter Helen Skelton once described being groped on air by an interviewee while pregnant. She did not complain, she said, because “that’s just the culture that television breeds. No one wants to be difficult.” The actor Jennifer Lawrence told the Hollywood Reporter that she had once stood up to a rude director. The reaction to the incident left her worried that she would be punished by the industry. “Yeah,” chipped in fellow actor Emma Stone: “You were ‘difficult’.”All this is edging towards the same idea, an idea that is imprinted on us from birth: that women are called unreasonable, selfish and unfeminine when they stand up for themselves. “I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is,” wrote Rebecca West in 1913. “I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute.”So what does it mean to be a difficult woman? I’m not talking about being rude, thoughtless, obnoxious or a a. First of all, difficult means complicated. A thumbs-up, thumbs-down approach to historical figures is boring and reductive. Most of us are more than one thing no one is pure everyone is “problematic”. Look back at early feminists and you will find women with views that are unpalatable to their modern sisters. You will find women with views that were unpalatable to their contemporaries. They were awkward and wrong-headed and obstinate and sometimes downright odd – and that helped them to defy the expectations placed on them. “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in 1903. “Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” (Or, as I always catch myself adding, the unreasonable woman.) A history of feminism should not try to sand off the sharp corners of the movement’s pioneers – or write them out of the story entirely, if their sins are deemed too great. It must allow them to be just as flawed – just as human – as men. Women are people, and people are more interesting than cliches. We don’t have to be perfect to deserve equal rights.The idea of role models is not necessarily a bad one, but the way they are used in feminism can dilute a radical political movement into feelgood inspiration porn. Holding up a few exceptions is no substitute for questioning the rules themselves, and in our rush to champion historical women, we are distorting the past. Take the wildly successful children’s book Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, which has sold more than a million copies. It tells 100 “empowering, moving and inspirational” stories, promising that “these are true fairytales for heroines who definitely don’t need rescuing”. Its entry for the fashion designer Coco Chanel mentions that she wanted to start a business, and a “wealthy friend of hers lent her enough money to make her dream come true”. It does not mention that Chanel was the lover of a Nazi officer and very probably a spy for Hitler’s Germany. In the 1930s, she tried to remove that “wealthy friend” from the company under racist laws that forbade Jews to own businesses. In the name of inspiring little girls living in a male-dominated world, the book doesn’t so much airbrush Chanel’s story as sandblast it. Do you find her wartime collaboration with the Nazis “empowering”? I don’t, although admittedly she does sound like a woman who “didn’t need rescuing”. The real Coco Chanel was clever, prejudiced, talented, cynical – and interesting. The pale version of her boiled down to a feminist saint is not.I can excuse that approach in a children’s book, but it’s alarming to see the same urge in adults. We cannot celebrate women’s history by stripping politics – and therefore conflict – from the narrative. Unfurl the bunting, and don’t ask too many questions! It creates a story of feminism where all the opponents are either cartoon baddies or mysteriously absent, where no hard compromises have to be made and internal disagreements are kicked under the carpet. The One True Way is obvious, and all Good People follow it. Feminists are on the right side of history, and we just have to wait for the world to catch up.Life does not work like that. It would be much easier if feminist triumphs relied on defeating a few bogeymen, but grotesque sexists such as Donald Trump only have power because otherwise decent people voted for them. There were women who opposed female suffrage women are the biggest consumers of magazines and websites that point out other women’s physical flaws there is no gender gap among supporters of abortion rights. People are complicated, and making progress is complicated too. If modern feminism feels toothless, it is because it has retreated into two modes: empty celebration or shadow-boxing with outright bastards. Neither deals with difficulty, and so neither can make a difference.Women’s history should not be a shallow hunt for heroines. Too often, I see feminists castigating each other for admiring the Pankhursts (autocrats), Andrea Dworkin (too aggressive), Jane Austen (too middle-class), Margaret Atwood (worried about due process in claims of sexual harassment) and Germaine Greer (where do I start?). I recently read a piece about how I was “problematic” for having expressed sympathy for the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. My crime was to say that his confirmation hearings had been turned into a media circus – and that even those accused of sexual assault deserved better. The criticism reflects a desperate desire to pretend that thorny issues are straightforward. No more flawed humans struggling inside vast, complicated systems: there are good guys and bad guys, and it’s easy to tell them apart. We must restore the complexity to feminist pioneers. Their legacies might be contested, they might have made terrible strategic choices and they might have not have lived according to the ideals they preached. But they mattered. Their difficulty is part of the story.Then there’s the second meaning of “difficult”. Any demand for greater rights faces opponents, and any advance creates a backlash. Changing the world is always difficult. At Dublin Castle in May 2018, waiting for the results of the Irish referendum on abortion law, I saw a banner that read: “If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” Those words come from a speech by Frederick Douglass, who campaigned for the end of the slave trade in the US. He wanted to make clear that “power concedes nothing without a demand”. In other words, campaigners have to be disruptive. They cannot take no for an answer. “Those who profess to favour freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without ploughing up the ground,” said Douglass. “They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.” Changing the world won’t make people like you. It will cause you pain. It will be difficult. It will feel like a struggle. You must accept the size of the mountain ahead of you, and start climbing it anyway.Then there is the difficulty of womanhood itself. In a world built for men, women will always struggle to fit in. We are what Simone de Beauvoir called “the second sex”. Our bodies are different from the standard (male) human. Our sexual desires have traditionally been depicted as fluid, hard to read, unpredictable. Our life experiences are mysterious and unknowable our minds are Freud’s “dark continent”. We are imagined to be on the wrong side of a world ided in two. Men are serious, women are silly. Men are rational, women are emotional. Men are strong, women are weak. Men are steadfast, women are fickle. Men are objective, women are subjective. Men are humanity, women are a subset of it. Men want sex and women grant or withhold it. Women are looked at men do the looking. When we are victims, it is hard to believe us. “At the heart of the struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the necessity of making women credible and audible,” wrote Rebecca Solnit in Men Explain Things to Me. “Billions of women must be out there on this six-billion-person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their own lives, that the truth is not their property, now or ever.”My favourite definition of feminism comes from the Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. A feminist, she said, is someone who believes in “the social, economic and political equality of the sexes”. That sounds straightforward, but feminism is endlessly difficult. The last 10 years have been praised for “changing the culture”, but led only to a few concrete victories. The #MeToo movement turned into a conversation about borderline cases and has not led to any substantial legal reforms. Abortion rights came under threat in eastern Europe and the southern United States. Gang-rape cases convulsed India and Spain. Free universal childcare was as much a dream as it had been in the 1970s. And the backlash has been brutal. Across the world, from Vladimir Putin in Russia to Narendra Modi in India to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, populists and nationalists are pushing a return to traditional gender roles, while the US president boasted of grabbing women “by the pussy”.Today’s feminist movement might be louder than previous generations, but is also more fractured, making it harder to achieve progress on any inidual issue. “Cancel culture” ensures that any feminist icon’s reputation feels fragile and provisional. We barely anoint a new heroine before we tear her down again. “Sisterhood is powerful,” the activist Ti-Grace Atkinson once said. “It kills. Mostly sisters.” Feminism often feels mired in petty arguments, with younger women casually denigrating the achievements of their predecessors. “Cancel the second wave,” read one headline. When I talked at an event about the fights for equal pay and domestic-violence shelters, one twentysomething woman casually replied: “Yeah, but all that stuff is sorted.”Feminism will always be difficult because it tries to represent half of humanity: 3.5 billion people (and counting) drawn from every race, class, country and religion. It is revolutionary, challenging the most fundamental structures of our society. It is deeply personal, illuminating our most intimate experiences and personal relationships. It rejects the ision between the public and private spheres. It gets everywhere, from boardrooms to bedrooms. It leaves no part of our lives untouched. It is both theory and practice.And there is another problem, unique to feminism. It is a movement run by women, for women. And what do we expect from women? Perfection. Selflessness. Care. Girls are instructed to be “ladylike” to keep them quiet and docile. Motherhood is championed as a journey of endless self-sacrifice. Random men tell us to “cheer up” in the street, because God forbid our own emotions should impinge on anyone else’s day. If we raise our voices, we are “shrill”. Our ambition is suspicious. Our anger is portrayed as unnatural, horrifying, disfiguring: who needs to listen to the “nag”, the “hysteric” or the “angry black woman”?All this is extremely unhelpful if you want to go out and cause trouble – the kind of trouble that leads to legal and cultural change. We pick apart feminism to see its failings, as if to reassure ourselves that women aren’t getting above their station. We describe women who challenge authority or seek power as unladylike, talkative, insistent, self-obsessed. We accuse them of “putting themselves forward”. The critic Emily Nussbaum nailed the problem: “When you’re put on a pedestal, the whole world gets to upskirt you.”For that reason, feminism has a particular duty to fight “the tyranny of niceness” – which is, and has always been, one of the most potent forces holding women back. Feminism is not a self-help movement, dedicated to making everyone feel better about their lives. It is a radical demand to overturn the status quo. It sometimes has to cause upset. “I cannot personally think of any widespread injustice that has been remedied by plodding worthily down the middle of the road, smiling and smiling,” wrote Jill Tweedie in 1971. “If you are sure of the justice of your cause it must be better to have people thinking of it with initial anger than not thinking at all.”In the early 20th century, the contraception pioneer Marie Stopes showed thousands of women how to enjoy sex – and how to stop risking their lives through endless pregnancies. She was also a domineering, self-mythologising eugenicist. The suffragettes helped to secure the vote for women, but the cost was bombings, arson, criminal damage and, in one case, throwing a hatchet at the prime minister. Today, we would call them terrorists. Jayaben Desai – who led the strikes at Grunwick in the 1970s, and showed Britain that “working class” was not synonymous with white and male – ultimately failed, and her protest contributed to the Thatcherite backlash against trade unions. The woman who founded the first domestic violence refuge in Britain, Erin Pizzey, is now a men’s rights activist who says feminism is destroying the family. Selma James preached the gospel of universal basic income: only she called it “wages for housework” and wanted it to go to women, so she was ignored. Caroline Norton, who fought so hard to reform Britain’s child custody laws, relied on her own middle-class respectability to make her arguments.All of these women belong in the history of feminism, not in spite of their flaws, but because we are all flawed. We have to resist the modern impulse to pick one of two settings: airbrush or discard. In the past decade, the internet – and particularly social media – has prompted a flowering of feminist activism. The Everyday Sexism project website, #MeToo and the Caitlin Moran-inspired publishing boom awakened a new generation to the idea that, no, sexism hadn’t been solved by their mothers and grandmothers. Their anger, their creativity and the power of their voices renewed feminism, creating its fourth wave.Underneath all the energy, though, a split could be observed. Some young activists saw the older generation as conservatives, wedded to fixed ideas of what men and women could be, whereas they felt gender was much more fluid and playful. Their mothers were equally bemused. They had tried to smash beauty standards and restrictive ideas about the nuclear family. They struggled to understand why their daughters were so desperate to have a big wedding, wear high heels, pore over Facetuned selfies. Feminism can, and must, contain all these contradictions, the differing priorities of difficult women. But one thing should unite us: we should still try to turn our outrage into political power. The fourth wave was beautifully noisy and attention-grabbing, but now we need concrete victories that will last in a way hashtag campaigns cannot. The #MeToo movement is a dead end without structural change, such as ensuring full and free access to employment tribunals.The fifth wave, if there is to be one, should look again at the seven demands of the first Women’s Liberation Movement conference, in Oxford 50 years ago this month. Equal pay. Equal educational and job opportunities. Free contraception and abortion on demand. Free 24-hour childcare. Legal and financial independence for all women. The right to a self-defined sexuality. Freedom from intimidation and violence. These are a reminder of how long the struggle has been – Northern Ireland only gained abortion rights last year – and how much there is left to do. Women are legally entitled to be paid the same as men, but as Samira Ahmed’s case against the BBC showed, laws are worthless if they are not enforced. Single parents (who are overwhelmingly female) still face a high risk of poverty. Lesbians are still attacked for saying “no” to the Great Almighty Penis. Social media and smartphones have created new expressions of misogyny, such as “revenge porn”, which rely on the same old mechanisms of intimidation and shame.Change requires us to put aside our egos, and our differences, and focus on our shared goals. The suffragettes saw themselves as an army. Jayaben Desai did not go on strike alone. Erin Pizzey and her “battered wives” made sure the government could not ignore them, by staging a sit-in at Downing Street. Feminism will never be free of infighting, of personality clashes and contests over priorities. It will never be perfect, or nice. But no wonder sexists and reactionaries are scared of it, because – by God, can it get things done •Difficult Women: A History of Feminism in 11 Fights by Helen Lewis is published by Jonathan Cape (£16.99).

As the Westminster-based events of Thursday unfolded, I recalled with mounting horror that I had at one point during 2018 described a Theresa May cabinet as “a government of all the talentless”. As so often over the past few years, this would turn out to be an absolute failure of the imagination. I now realise I was, back then, living through a halcyon era of political accomplishment. Jeremy Hunt, Philip Hammond, even David Davis … those guys were like the Time Lords – or Socratic statesmen, or masters of the Glass Bead Game – compared with what was reshuffled into existence on Thursday.And so to a series of appointments widely reported as a triumph for prime ministerial carer Dominic Cummings, who never lets up in his quest for the best and the brightest. Which maverick aces in the pack are going to Top Gun? I feel like this morning’s cabinet meeting should have been akin to the scene where Maverick turns up at Miramar and meets Iceman and Hollywood and all the other shit-hot talents he’s going to avert world war three with, somewhere over the Indian Ocean. But instead all I’ve got is a Sky News clip of Boris Johnson – looking like someone forced Andy from Little Britain into a suit – being wheeled out to gurn, “How many new buses are we going to introduce?” And then Grant Shapps is putting his hand up and chirping, “Four thousand four hundred!”Jesus Christ, Cummings – is this the best of the best? Just turn in your wings and give the Commies the keys to the west.Or to put it another way: I’m afraid Johnson’s much-vaunted reshuffle this week merely served as a reminder that the only positive discrimination scheme in this country that has long functioned to the highest level is the one that puts idiots in the cabinet. By this metric, the loss of Andrea Leadsom is a blow, but one that’s more than made up for by the promotion of the likes of Oliver Dowden, Alok Sharma, Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Suella Braverman. Braverman in particular is mesmerically dim, with a classic Channel 4 News interview with the attorney general suggesting not only that she could be outperformed at the dispatch box but that she could be outperformed by the dispatch box. Or indeed any other item of furniture in the Palace of Westminster.In a completely unforced error, then, Johnson has shown weakness just when he should be at his strongest. So it’ll be interesting to see what he shows when he’s weakened – there aren’t really a whole lot of places to go when your power move was to give some of this lot a run-out. Certainly not within the animal kingdom. Potential vegetable or mineral appointments I can’t speak for.Still, it’s always nice to see the prime minister allowed down from the attic to do a bit of prime ministering. As befits a man who spends more time with some of his catchphrases than with some of his kids, Johnson began by leading the cabinet in a pantomime call-and-response exercise to which they dutifully submitted. “How many hospitals are we going to build?” asked the prime minister. “Forty!” lied the cabinet in unison.“How many more police officers are we recruiting?” “Twenty thousand!”“How many more nurses are we recruiting?” “Fifty thousand!” And so on.Other lowlights of the reshuffle included the return of Zac (now Lord) Goldsmith. Two months ago, Goldsmith was rejected by the apparently sainted voters at the general election. He is now a minister in three – THREE – separate government departments. But headline news was, of course, the departure of Sajid The Saj Javid, who walked out rather than obey the command to fire his advisers while Cummings watched pantingly behind an arras (I’m vaguely paraphrasing).Downing Street characterised its new working relationship with this chancellor as “hand in glove”, an analogy that appears to cast Mr Sunak as a glove. The question is whether he will be of the puppet variety or simply the latex prophylactic worn as Cummings begins his cavity search of the public finances.As for Sunak, my immediate concern is that the world’s fifth largest economy is now in the hands of someone who went on the record to describe The Rise of Skywalker as “a great night out”. Let’s see that in action. In a tweet dated 20 December last year, Sunak posted a picture of himself and Javid at a cinema screening of The Rise of Skywalker, with the judgment: “Great night out with the boss #TheRiseofSkywalker.” That may turn out to have been the warning sign. We have now seen control of the public finances pass to an inidual who not only tolerates space horses galloping across an actual star destroyer, or Chewbacca being given some kind of patronising lifetime achievement award, but actively rates that and other cinematic atrocities as part of “a great night out”. Sorry, but no.From one tedious fandom to another, meanwhile, as the reshuffle drama merely adds another 37 volumes to the vast amount of Cummingslore being churned out every week by the Classic Subs to his Classic Dom. Barely 10 days ago, reports of Cummings’s waning influence were dismissed breathlessly by some insider or other with the words: “Whitehall is littered with the bodies of those who have underestimated Dom.”And yet … is it really, babe? Whitehall is now littered with living secretaries of state such as Gavin Williamson, while Liz Truss – who’d lose a battle of wits with an emoji – is the longest serving cabinet minister. It’s not exactly Team of Rivals, is it?Whether Cummings will ever walk even a tenth of his talk remains to be seen. For now, the overwhelming impression he gives is of one who came to cool-guy status at a somewhat belated stage in life. Or rather, what he imagines as cool-guy status. As such, he cannot wear his newfound cachet lightly. The prime minister’s most powerful aide forever seems to be stagily flaunting some clever book he’s reading, or sneering sub-par one-liners like, “I’ll see half of you next Friday”, or big-boy boss warnings, like, “I’ll bin you within weeks if you don’t fit – don’t complain later because I made it clear now.”What can you say, other than: Oooooooh? Cummings always seems to be trying rather too hard with all this, in a way that reminds me of a hilarious Clive James essay on the status-obsessed romantic novelist Judith Krantz. “Mrs Krantz would probably hate to hear it said,” James observed, “but she gives the impression of having been included late among the exclusiveness she so admires. There is nothing wrong with gusto, but when easy familiarity is what you are trying to convey, gush is to be avoided.”And so with Cummings and his late-gained sublebrity. When badass outsider is what you are trying to convey, insisting to everyone you’re a badass outsider is to be avoided. We must look forward to the day when Dominic decides to show not tell. But until then, it all remains somewhat embarrassing for everyone involved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ce7641ab5784a8eba4fa240bcf7f154f2b2165/0_104_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70995da30984d41b849f3d4d3bbd1a84","title":"alok sharma cop26 success climate change","story":"As energy secretary and Cop president, Sharma is uniquely placed to tackle climate change at home and overseasThe wait is over for the new president of the all-important United Nations climate conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November. Alok Sharma is set to take on this high-octane diplomatic role while also juggling the immensely powerful job of leading the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Some may see this as a herculean task, but the BEIS secretary is in a unique position to lead the charge in tackling the climate emergency. His portfolio now includes not just delivering net-zero carbon in the UK but also convincing the world to follow suit.Reportedly turned down by former Conservative heavyweights David Cameron and William Hague, the Cop26 presidency had been in a state of limbo. The sacked president, Claire O’Neill, warned of a serious leadership gap in her departing missive to Boris Johnson. Having a cabinet minister now leading the charge is welcome, but the new minister’s voting record on climate does not instil confidence. He has voted against support for carbon-capture projects and taxing polluting vehicles and dirty power stations, among other things.Cop26 is a different kettle of fish, and making it a success is vital to tackling climate change. In 2019, Cop25 ended in disappointment, as rich nations failed to enhance their carbon-cutting commitments or raise more money for countries struggling to cope with climate impacts. A similar outcome in Glasgow will mean inaction until 2025, and we simply cannot afford that.The new Cop26 president and the UK government face a major diplomatic task over the next few months to persuade high carbon-emitting nations, such as China and India, to commit to greater cuts, while getting the EU, US and other rich countries to meet the pledge made a decade ago to raise $100bn a year in climate finance. Existing contributions from all the nations combined put us on a path to increasing average global temperatures by 3.2C by 2100, while the Paris accord commits nations to a pathway of well below 2C. This will be the ultimate test of the conference in November. Every tenth of a degree makes a huge difference to the lives and livelihoods of millions at the frontline of climate change.The success of this conference will rely heavily on manoeuvring the full force of the UK’s diplomats and climate attaches from around the world, who will work with negotiators of key countries to secure necessary commitments and concessions. Working closely with the EU and other high-ambition partners will be vital to shift the position of China and India, in particular, as long as the diplomacy respects their need for greater finance and technology to bring millions of their citizens out of poverty and pursue a clean development strategy. Both nations made clear at the UN climate summit last year that any request for further emission cuts from them needs to be backed by substantially greater finance.The new Cop26 president has his work cut out. As the former secretary of state for international development, Sharma hosted environment ministers from around the world to gear up for Cop26 and focused his department’s attention on climate-change adaptation overseas, indicating perhaps his and his party’s growing interest in this issue.But Whitehall may have bitten off more than it can chew as it tries to secure post-Brexit trade deals by the end of the year while also striving to make a success of the climate conference. The two goals aren’t incompatible, as the UK’s climate targets are set in domestic law and a trade deal will not affect that. However, if the past three years have taught us anything, it’s that the government has a very limited capacity to deal with policy questions unrelated to Brexit. The BEIS department itself is responsible for making sure British businesses adjust to the post-Brexit trade regime, as well as emissions targets. The only way to achieve that now is to centre climate change in trade negotiations and support businesses in their low-carbon transition.Leadership at home is also vital if we are to inspire the major economies of the world to cut carbon emissions. The recent announcement to end the sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 was important, but it was relatively low-hanging fruit. Tougher decisions will have to be taken on cutting carbon from our homes and our large industries such as steel, and getting the UK on track to net-zero. As BEIS secretary, it’s within Sharma’s gift to take these difficult, but necessary, decisions. For now, however, to be taken seriously as a credible host, Sharma needs to put forward a bold, revised carbon target for 2030 (as required by the UN, with advice from the Committee on Climate Change) with a clear policy pathway to meeting it. The next 10 years of action are what matters to make or break our chances of avoiding a climate catastrophe.How the minister uses the full power of his combined roles to achieve this green transformation at home while urging the same overseas is yet to be seen. Any outcome of a Cop conference reflects largely on the host, and Sharma has a massive responsibility to make a success of it.• Chaitanya Kumar is head of energy and climate policy at Green Alliance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcf1261a48325927a9d5a713b78a48a5535202a/0_78_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef9b778a5842636fc8476fe42a7731f0","title":"the guardian view on looking for aliens friends in the sky","story":"Is there anybody out there? For centuries human beings have wondered, although the ways in which we have gone about this have varied, encompassing spiritual and metaphysical questions as well as scientific ones. As we have gained greater understanding of the universe, however, our searches have taken on more concrete form. Questions about extraterrestrials have become a subject for science rather than science fiction and philosophy.Now a new collaboration between the Very Large Array observatory in New Mexico and the privately funded Seti Institute in California, could mean that our curiosity about aliens is closer than ever before to being satisfied. Data from the VLA’s 28 giant radio telescopes, configured so as to scan a vast expanse of sky, will be fed through a special supercomputer that will search for distant signals. Scientists who work at the Seti Institute said the announcement means their research, for a long time confined to the eccentric margins of respectable science, are now “almost mainstream”.How likely it is that a signal will be found, and what this might mean, are hard questions to answer. Seti’s existing projects have not detected any transmissions from other planets so far. But recent discoveries in space and Earth sciences have provided some encouragement to those who are enthusiastic about the prospect, however remote, of detecting other civilisations.While once it was thought that our solar system could be unique, since the discovery of the first exoplanet (a planet in another solar system) in the 1990s, thousands more have been located. Around one in five stars are now thought to have a planet in their orbit in a so-called “habitable zone” – that is, at a distance from the star where the temperature (neither too hot nor too cold) means that life is theoretically feasible.At the same time, the date at which life on Earth is thought to have started has been pushed back. Whereas once it was thought that the deep oceans could have sat dead and empty for billions of years before a freak chemical reaction produced the primitive cells that were the first form of life, recent science suggests that this could have happened much more quickly after the planet formed 4.5bn years ago. If it happened here, why not elsewhere?Are Earth’s 7.5 billion human inhabitants, along with the billions of other animals and plants we share our home with, on our own in the universe, our blue planet an oasis in a desert of rocks and gases? If there is another life form somewhere, could it be as intelligent as us? Or pose a risk to us, as the physicist Stephen Hawking once warned? As investigations of Mars continue, and a new set of observations from the James Webb Space Telescope are set to begin, our interest in the possibility of alien life appears undimmed – even as conditions in our own biosphere appear ever more unstable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65f8ea3153211bf385ddc72a43210a0b93a3edd9/0_445_7988_4793/master/7988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=733f08923e3b446a97c8bc2799388b2b","title":"trans rights labour leadership candidates","story":"A pledge supported by three of the four leadership candidates has exposed a faultline running through the partyThis isn’t just another factional fight pitting left against right or millennial against boomer. Even Laura Pidcock, a 32-year-old Corbynite rising star who recently lost her seat, was loudly criticised online for writing that “the women’s movement needs the space to talk about sex and gender without fear of being no-platformed”. It’s difficult to tell how many MPs agree when so many now nervously swerve the whole topic. But there’s nowhere to hide in a leadership contest. When Nandy told a recent hustings that “trans women are women” there were whoops of delight. But ask around for women feeling alienated from Labour over this issue and they’re easily found.Some are survivors of domestic violence who resent being told to “educate yourself”. Others are bewildered that decades of loyally knocking on doors seemingly hasn’t earned them the right to be heard. They long to hear someone defend what is still Labour’s official policy: promoting trans equality but defending powers in equality law that let organisations exclude trans women from all-female spaces in exceptional circumstances. Yet even Starmer goes no further than urging people to “dial it down”.Why is the left, home of liberation struggles, making such hard work of this? It was a Tory government that fumbled trans rights reform, rushing out plans for people to self-identify but running away when that got controversial. Yet it’s Labour and the Liberal Democrats ripping themselves apart over it. Where downtrodden minorities revolt against oppressive majorities, progressives know which side they’re on, but this is their Sophie’s Choice: two marginalised groups, each demanding protection from the other.Identity politics, rooted as it is in iniduals’ feelings about themselves, is perhaps uniquely challenging for the left. The Tories are comfortably a party of iniduals but Labour is one of collective struggle, and now solidarity is breaking down. Women who have waved placards all their lives now find themselves picketed, outside WPUK meetings, by people they’d once have marched alongside. Tensions between some trans and lesbian activists strain LGBT alliances (the tale of how this pledge emerged is People’s Front of Judea stuff, but suffice to say there are now two rival trans-friendly charters circulating, with Starmer backing one from the long-established LGBT+ Labour grouping). If the next leader’s task is bringing Labour together, this doesn’t bode well.Yet it’s still not too late to find common ground. No compassionate human being should want a woman who has been raped or brutalised to feel traumatised all over again by sharing counselling or refuge services with someone they perceive as a threat. Even a person who poses no danger whatsoever can inadvertently frighten a traumatised person, if something about them – a sound, a scent, a habit – triggers flashbacks. But nobody should want trans people to feel unsafe or cast out, and barring a trans woman from women’s services seems the cruellest of personal repudiations. That much is common ground, and beyond the boiling hate of social media, people are building on it.Some refuges have now accepted trans women (excellent risk assessment helps, and careful laying out of accommodation). Some schools absorb gender-questioning pupils without fuss teens queue happily for mixed Topshop changing rooms and with time, maybe we’ll wonder why unisex loos were ever an issue.But solutions don’t come from denying there is something to solve, and that’s why any future leader should have paused over point five of the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights charter, requiring candidates to accept there are “no material conflicts” between cis women’s rights and those of trans women.For what some women hear when they hear those words is that there’s conflict, all right, but not legitimate conflict no honest reason to get upset, beyond bigotry or ignorance, and therefore nothing substantial to discuss. As Pidcock discovered, the next step is outrage at the very idea of women still wanting to discuss it. Conversation closed.To acknowledge that two sides of an argument exist is not to agree with every aspect of either. But the road to change is littered with objections, and the point of politics is not to ban them: it’s to work patiently through the serious ones while always moving forward. Labour needs a leader who can talk as well as walk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278ae6c8a882431c45e4e41506acbbfcd7e7c7eb/0_125_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb57212b5d8181edddfd807ddd95e329","title":"what lies beneath the nature park covering up a dirty secret aoe","story":"Once one of western Europe’s biggest landfill sites, Thurrock Thameside is now a thriving haven for wildlifeStanding on top of the visitor centre at Thurrock Thameside Nature Park, you could be forgiven for being disappointed by the view: a large field of brambles. But just 10 years ago, the same view would have been even more disappointing: mountains of rubbish heaped up on one of Europe’s largest landfill sites.For 50 years, the site absorbed waste belched out by Londoners. Now the only reminder of its past life is the odd piece of discarded metal.The park might look unloved, but the reserve is meticulously managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT) and provides a valuable home for some of the UK’s rarest inhabitants, including cuckoos, adders, water voles and the extremely rare shrill carder bee.“This is the best view in Essex,” says Emily McParland, communications manager at EWT, who urges visitors to the site on the Thames estuary to “celebrate unglamorous landscapes”.“Many people are unaware of just how valuable scrub is as a habitat. It is one of the most underrated habitats and some of our most iconic British species need scrubland to thrive, so that is one thing we try to educate our visitors about,” she says.In the mid-1990s there were about 1,500 active landfill sites in the UK. Now there are fewer than 250, largely because taxes were introduced that made sending rubbish to landfill more expensive than incineration.“This isn’t surprising. It is likely in many cases that the land isn’t suitable for other uses due to the waste buried beneath it,” says Brand.The landfill that forms Thurrock’s scruffy 49-hectare (120-acre) hillock sits on top of a 1920s quarry, which provided building materials for the burgeoning capital. The mine closed in the 1950s and the city’s unwanted waste was brought back and dumped in the newly vacant space. At one point Mucking Marsh landfill, as the site was called then, took 660,000 tonnes of rubbish every year.Now it provides an important pit stop for short-eared owls from Iceland, nightingales from Senegal and song thrushes from Russia looking to refuel on bugs and berries before continuing their travels.All this life is reliant on a layer of clay crust just 1.4 metres (4.6ft) thick, which sits on 30 metres of gurgling waste, weighing around 20m tonnes. The only building on site – the visitor centre – is held upright by hydraulic jacks.Like most landfill sites, this crust is too thin to support trees because their roots would penetrate the black plastic the waste is wrapped in, potentially causing methane and toxic liquids to be released into the environment. This is why wildlife reserves on landfill sites are often left as scrub or grassland.Thurrock’s transformation from rubbish dump to wildlife reserve came about from a £2.8m agreement between Enovert Community Trust – previously Cory Environmental Trust – and the London Gateway port operator, DP World, to improve wildlife sites along the estuary. The landfill stopped accepting waste in 2010 and as each section was sealed up it was released to EWT to look after. Once the clay top is complete, the EWT reserve will be 340 hectares – double the size of Regent’s Park.Mucking Marsh landfill belches out enough methane gas to power around 10,500 homes. This potent greenhouse gas is released via a pipeline and then combusted to form CO2 and particulate matter before being released into the atmosphere. Enovert will manage the decaying matter until it stops producing gas, which is expected to happen in 2040. The decay of organic waste on landfills accounts for one third of UK’s methane emissions, so making sure landfills are properly sealed is key to minimising environmental damage.Other grassy mounds along the estuary – such as those at Beckton and Rainham – have been formed in recent years. They might look like the remains of some iron age fort, but they too are stuffed full of modern man’s excesses and neatly capped off with a clay “pie crust” as if nothing had happened.When David Attenborough opened Thurrock Thameside nature reserve in 2013, he said its transformation marked a “new chapter” in the Thames estuary. In the years following his visit, the number of plant species has increased from 48 to 91, according to EWT, with bee orchid, yellow rattle and bird’s foot trefoil all new additions to the site.Whitethroat, stonechat, song thrush and linnet already use the brambles for nest-building and foraging, and in the coming years EWT plans to put down a seed mix of grain and millet to attract more farmland birds which have suffered substantial declines, including skylarks, corn buntings and turtle doves, which are currently heading towards extinction in the UK.Reptiles such as the adder are also flourishing, overwintering in the undisturbed brambles and emerging in spring to warm themselves up on the grassy edges.Thurrock Thameside is far from a manicured environment, but this is the sort of land nature needs, says Prof Karl Williams, director of theCentre for Waste Management at the University of Central Lancashire. “Land that is good for wildlife normally looks unkempt in our eyes,” he says.“You’d be surprised how close landfill sites are to where you live. A lot of the time they are filling a hole in the ground and are restoring land to what it was before quarrying and mining. They cannot be developed on, so it allows nature to reclaim them and for species to come back.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a24721d123547821799bd520dd9adbbdf05d4a/1020_418_3542_2125/master/3542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241bbf656c32b21ca7b8856933dcbe6f","title":"the best vegan lipsticks","story":"Give bees and beetles a break, but still pull off the right finishI always feel matte finishes are the truest measure of a lipstick brand, as they pose the biggest challenge – colour must be vivid and dense (any fool can make sheer tinted balm) lasting power should be long lips should remain comfortable, not dry, rough and tight.

This rice dish, conceived by its genius chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, is as simple as it is delicious, so we’ve left it more or less alone. It’s a good idea to make more of the fried ginger and garlic than you need here, because it’s lovely sprinkled over salads, rice dishes and grilled meat.

Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-18 minutes, until the mixture is crisp and golden. Stir in the chilli, then transfer the mixture to a plate, spacing it out so it can crisp further.Meanwhile, put the butter and a teaspoon and half of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the leek and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, until soft and lightly coloured. Turn the heat to high and add the rice, stirring to break it up and spread it out over the whole cooking surface. Leave to brown in places, stir again, and repeat for four to five minutes, until the rice is heated through and well browned. Stir in the spring onion, soy and sesame oil, and turn off the heat.Put the remaining teaspoon and the remaining olive oil in a small, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, crack in the egg and sprinkle lightly with salt.

That created a perception that the Abu Dhabi hierarchy, in their drive to mega-spend on City attaining elite status while somehow complying with FFP rules, had deceived Uefa in their financial submissions. This serious trouble for City sprang from a tiny number of emails, a fraction of the documentary dump provided to Spiegel by its source, Rui Pinto, a Portuguese national now charged in his home country with 147 criminal offences including computer hacking, all of which he denies.FFP rules limit the amount of money owners can put in to bankroll losses, encouraging top-ision European clubs not to overspend on players’ wages and transfer fees and risk falling into financial crisis, and to spend within their revenues. Mansour started financing mega-losses on player signings and wages after his 2008 takeover and City had scrambled, particularly following the introduction of FFP in 2011, to turbo-boost their revenues with large sponsorships from Abu Dhabi companies.Following the Spiegel coverage, Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) investigatory chamber (IC) finally announced last March that it was launching an investigation, and City responded by saying they would comfortably prove that the accusations were “entirely false”. The IC, a panel of grandees chaired by Yves Leterme, a former Belgian prime minister, was clearly not convinced, however, after its inquiry which involved two days of hearings, and it charged the club in May. City responded with scorn, accusing the IC of ignoring “a comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence”, said the decision was the result of “mistakes, misinterpretations and confusions fundamentally borne out of a basic lack of due process”, and in effect accused the IC of being biased, running “a wholly unsatisfactory, curtailed, and hostile process”.City expressed huge outrage that the IC’s pending decision to charge was leaked two days early – which was indeed embarrassing to Uefa – although the truth is that throughout the process, very little detail has leaked. The fact that the IC did charge City, though, made it self-evident that the hierarchy’s explanations, and whatever documentation they did provide, did not satisfy the IC that questions raised by the club’s own internal communications had been irrefutably answered.The IC can reasonably have expected City to produce, for example, the internal replies to Chumillas’s stunning emails, which perhaps would show he had been corrected, or that in context it could be shown that it was simply, “irrefutably”, not the case that ADUG was funding the Etihad sponsorship. Instead, the IC clearly decided that the allegations had not been refuted, and sent them for determination by Uefa’s CFCB adjudicatory chamber, which is chaired by José Narciso da Cunha Rodrigues, a former general prosecutor in Portugal and judge at the European Court of Justice, and includes a leading British barrister, Charles Flint QC.These public responses after the charges were laid were consistent with the second element exposed by the emails: how hostile and confrontational City had been to Uefa, and to FFP itself, throughout the process of compliance – at times distastefully so. FFP applied to all top-flight clubs across Europe competing in the Champions and Europa Leagues, seeking to encourage long-term football development and dampen player wage inflation, with detailed new regulations and a sophisticated reporting system developed by Uefa with blue-chip accountants.City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, was never a major supporter of FFP, seeing it as a restraint of Mansour’s freedom to rebuild City by pouring money in, but the emails showed the resistance went further. It seemed as if the hierarchy had almost taken it personally, feeling that this whole FFP system was a protectionist move to stop Mansour’s extravagance challenging the established superclubs. Perhaps there was something of that in the support for FFP given by Bayern Munich and the German clubs in particular, but they were trying to maintain financial sustainability in the Bundesliga where most clubs are still ultimately controlled by supporters. They and many other clubs in Europe felt it was alien to the game’s traditions for Gulf sovereign investors to buy clubs and spend their way to success.In 2014, the IC determined that City had a deficit of €180m over that two-year period, vastly in excess of the €45m permitted, and in May that year agreed a settlement which some at Uefa believed was too lenient. A day before that, the former chair of the IC, Jean-Luc Dehaene, a distinguished former prime minister of Belgium and senior EU politician, died aged 73, survived by his wife of 49 years and their four children. Spiegel quoted Cliff’s reaction to this news in an internal email, referring to the membership of the IC: “1 down, 6 to go.”Since its exposure, no one from City has apologised for that email, apparently due to the stance that the emails were hacked, so the contents, however unfortunate, are not to be acknowledged.The third element revealed in the leaked material did not mostly form part of the IC’s investigation, having been dealt with as part of the 2014 settlement, but it revealed the extent to which City had engaged in some creative accounting to persuade Uefa it had complied with the new “break-even” rules. Most of these restructurings had been spotted and disallowed by the IC and the consultants, PwC, it sent to peer into the detail.Following the publication of the leaks, City refused to respond at all to Spiegel, the rest of the media and to Uefa, until the IC, having initially responded uncertainly, decided it had to investigate. City denounced the use of the emails as “out-of-context materials purportedly hacked or stolen”, and alleged there was an “organised and clear attempt to damage the club’s reputation”.Spiegel anonymised its source as “John” in the coverage, and quoted him denying that he acquired his vaults of 70m documents from football strongholds as a result of hacks, saying he had good contacts. Within weeks he was identified as Pinto, now on remand in a Lisbon prison awaiting trial, charged with alleged hacking and other offences, although only against Portuguese clubs and institutions, not City or Uefa. Pinto acknowledged to Spiegel in December that there was hacking software on his computer, and “some of my acts may be considered illegal”, but denied he had committed criminal offences, saying: “I don’t consider myself a hacker.”But for people, or organisations such as City, who find they are victims of leaks, or hacks, there is a deeply uncomfortable contradiction to the consequences. However justified their outrage, if the documents reveal possible wrongdoing, then regulators or governing bodies are duty bound to investigate.Now, after a review of the evidence and a hearing last month, the AC has decided like the IC, that City’s hierarchy have been damned by their own internal material.

For others in Spain, the focus was turned more towards the immediate implications, although the news was equally huge: it was front page everywhere, exclamation marks underlining the shock. “City, out of Europe!” said Marca. AS went for “OUT”, in English. “Blow for City: two years without the Champions!” said Sport. “Jaque al jeque,” ran the cover of El Mundo Deportivo: check against the sheik.Whether it is checkmate will depend on the appeal but, as Sport put it, this could “bring the whole castle crumbling down” “City’s project is in serious danger”. Everywhere, there were photos of Pep Guardiola in a series of concerned poses: head in hands, distant look. The accusations date from before his arrival, of course, but in Spain he remains the image of City and much was made of what this might mean for him and his players: lists of men who might depart were drawn up, Guardiola at the top of them. “The punishment brings him closer to Juventus,” AS said. And it won’t be long before his footballers are linked to clubs here. It’s easier to fish in a raging river, as they say in Spain. SLMost of all, though, Italy’s sporting media was eager to discuss what it might mean for the future of Guardiola. The manager was linked with Juventus in the summer. The man who got the job instead, Maurizio Sarri, has come under fire after claiming just one win in his last four games.

Perhaps owing to the fact that this charge against Manchester City pertains to their financial activity in 2012-16, a time period for which PSG were recently exempted from being further investigated about following a Cas ruling in March 2019.

They would not be tempted into what any set of fourth-tier players would be forgiven for doing, and buy in bulk for a day out at Wembley. The message was clear, and deadly serious: they would go hell for leather towards competing there themselves.Given that they travel to face Manchester City on Sunday, the odds are on that ambition stalling in the last 16. Ipswich are only the second team at their level to have reached this stage and their manager, Joe Sheehan, has a point when he says a win would be “the biggest upset ever”. But this is one of the most progressive clubs in women’s football and that is why, regardless of how they fare against the holders, his players’ confidence appears bulletproof.“The day after the draw, people were saying to me: ‘What a great occasion, a great experience for the players, go and enjoy it,’” Sheehan says. “But I thought: ‘No, that’s not us we’re not just about occasions. We’re going to try and win the game, because that’s what we do.’”That is beyond dispute. Ipswich are top of the FA Women’s Nations League Division One East and have dropped five points in their 11 games they have won six matches to reach the fifth round and, last time out, thrashed third‑tier Huddersfield 4-1 at the John Smith’s Stadium. Some of their technical, attacking football is of a standard unrecognisable among their peers and it is no surprise that the 31-year-old Sheehan has received offers from clubs higher up. Nor is it a shock that he has turned them down, because he knows he is sitting on a goldmine.“There are going to be clubs in the WSL that aren’t doing what we’re doing,” says Sheehan, who began leading the seniors a year ago. “What our players have access to in terms of development is sensational.”Six of the squad are enrolled in the sixth form at St Joseph’s college, a local independent school, as part of a dual-careers programme designed to balance players’ sporting and educational ambitions. “It’s such an amazing thing, playing football every day with your best mates,” says the winger Anna Grey, who turned 18 on Tuesday. “We’re just living the dream really, doing the things you’ve always wanted to do.”Ipswich’s lineups against opponents such as Actonians, Kent United and Billericay Town in league fixtures on Sundays often bear close resemblance to the under-21 selections that have faced more illustrious foes in midweek. But they also field senior players who know the hardships historically faced by budding female footballers. Amanda Crump, the captain, has been involved for two decades, slogging through midfield battles during those years when the side’s fortunes were virtually ignored. Then there is Natasha Thomas, one of the best centre-forwards outside the WSL, who rejected an offer from second‑tier Lewes last month and has scored 88 times in 107 appearances since 2015.Thomas works as a receptionist in her home town, Lowestoft, and it takes more than an hour to drive to the twice-weekly training sessions. She considered giving up football a couple of years ago but has felt re-energised since Sheehan’s arrival. “I’m from the middle of nowhere, really, and never thought I could get this far,” she says. “Things here have changed drastically. I’ve been in shops and people recognise you: ‘Don’t you play for Ipswich?’ It’s nice to know we are making people smile and I hope younger girls from my area will now think: ‘I can give it a go.’”Nowadays the club is integrated with the men’s setup and the result is a rare level of cooperation. Paul Lambert frequently watches the under-21s’ games and is conversant with all the players’ names and attributes he makes himself available to Sheehan and his staff for tactical meetings and run-throughs of the seniors’ video footage, and has conducted some training sessions. On Tuesday, Ipswich Women played against the men’s under-18s in an effort to familiarise themselves with the tempo City might produce. “It couldn’t be any better,” Sheehan says. “I’m not aware of many other clubs where you get this level of support.”The town itself, previously asleep to its women’s team, is waking up, too. Around 400 supporters will travel to Manchester and crowds for home games are the highest in the fourth tier, with 761 attending the derby against Norwich. Something has stirred here although promotion, no certainty in an attritional ision, is required soon to ensure Ipswich stay on schedule. The sense around the club is that hauling themselves up a ision at last could be the hardest part of a journey to the WSL.Their job at City might top that. Grey, who sees Georgia Stanway as an inspiration but would love to swap shirts with Steph Houghton, believes “anything is possible”. It is an attitude Sheehan, a glint in his eyes as he considers the prospect, detects throughout his ranks.“It’s a monumental task but there’s something about this group,” he says. “They’re so brave, and have so much belief and confidence in each other, that they won’t be fazed. They’ll be licking their lips to get out there and have a go. It’s going to be an incredible weekend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d86ebc97c9a9bad9dd2205b870138f000d899b69/72_2_1510_906/master/1510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f16763780789bec51468a6b80672bdd8","title":"southampton burnley premier league match report","story":"Matej Vydra produced a moment of magic to end his goalscoring drought and keep Burnley looking up in the Premier League after inflicting defeat on a Southampton side still nervously peering over their shoulder.Vydra, a first-half substitute, scored his first goal for 511 days to fire Sean Dyche’s side to victory in filthy conditions on the south coast after a freakish goal by Ashley Westwood opened the scoring. Danny Ings cancelled out Westwood’s strike direct from a corner, his 15th goal of the season, but Burnley held on to earn victory over Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side.This was a reverse of the opening game of the season, when Hasenhüttl bemoaned seven weeks of pre-season training going to waste in an instant after his team’s second-half capitulation. But here, after a reduced winter break following their FA Cup fourth-round replay defeat to Tottenham Hotspur, four days of work unravelled inside 95 seconds. Ings, guarding the near post, inexplicably allowed Westwood’s corner to curl in, purposefully bending out of the way to allow the ball smooth passage, much to the surprise of the Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy.Westwood wheeled away, his routine corner having flummoxed Ings but Southampton responded with great gusto amid challenging conditions. Jack Stephens stormed forward from defence before Burnley eventually intervened, cutting the ball out of a corner before Ings charged to block Phil Bardsley’s pass upfield, his eagerness to make amends clear. Ings threw himself at the ball and the striker’s momentum sent him flying over the touchline and into the Southampton technical area, where he almost collided with Hasenhuttl on the follow through.Ings was determined to redeem himself and, despite his team going home empty-handed, it was the striker who earned Southampton a lifeline 15 minutes after gifting Burnley the opener. Ben Mee and Jack Cork failed to clear the danger on the edge of their 18-yard box, inviting Ings to pick up the loose ball, wriggle into an alcove of space and power a strike into the pocket of Nick Pope’s goal only Sergio Aguero and Jamie Vardy have scored more Premier League goals this season.A vicious swirling wind, hail and relentless rain kept things interesting and the game occasionally drifted into slapstick, be it defenders skidding on the turf as they desperately tried to clear their lines or the Burnley goalkeeper Pope in effect capsizing after booting the ball downfield. Pope superbly denied Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg approaching stoppage time, while Southampton also had a penalty appeal turned down late on, when the video assistant referee Michael Oliver deemed Mee did not handball Stephens’s cross.Vydra, though, made light of the conditions to score a classy match-winning goal having replaced the injured Chris Wood midway through the first half. Westwood flighted a wonderful diagonal pass towards Vydra, who effortlessly chested the ball away from Stephens with his first touch before dinking it away from the Southampton debutant Kyle Walker-Peters and arrowing a thunderous left-footed drive into the top corner of the Southampton goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67c2569f2bb1f703aeedc27c9742d0aeff4624c5/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d64a3de9f50607c3dce120fafc8ed6","title":"barcelona v getafe manchester city latest football clockwatch live","story":"A pulsating finish at the Hawthorns, where West Brom had a goal disallowed for a dubious offside in the last minute of injury time.

The home side did nothing after going behind for a second time, and despite Danny Ings’ excellent first-half strike, were beaten fair and square. In-form Burnley move into the top half of the Premier League table they’re on 34 points, one behind ninth-placed Manchester United. Southampton stay in 13th on 31.It’s ten points out of the last 12 for Burnley. Saints are booed off.90 min +3: Vydra takes the ball towards the flag out on the left, and tries to trick Vestrgaard into fouling him. He doesn’t win a free kick, but the clock ticks on.90 min +2: Four added minutes. The first two whistle by without Saints threatening.90 min: Saints are leaving all sorts of gaps at the back now, as they chase the equaliser. Hendrick creams a pass towards Vydra, who is free down the middle, but McCarthy comes out of his box to clear. Then the home side go up the other end, Hojbjerg bringing down a left-wing cross, just to the right of the six-yard box. He slaps a shot straight at Pope, though take nothing away from the keeper’s work. He made himself big, and looks to have secured the three points for Burnley.89 min: Rodriguez rasps a rising shot towards the top right. McCarthy tips it over. Corner. It’s swung towards the back post, but Vydra can’t connect and the pressure’s off the home side.88 min: Obafemi goes up for a high ball with Bardsley, and leaves an elbow on the Burnley man’s temple. He’s extremely fortunate to get away with just a yellow card. He should be walking.86 min: Long is replaced by Adams. Saints win a corner and do nothing with it.85 min: Ralph Hasenhuttl is livid with the no-penalty decision, and he’s got a point. On the one hand, Mee didn’t move his arm towards the ball, in fact he was pulling it away. However, that arm was hanging well wide of the defender’s body. Not a completely natural position. File under: You’ve Seen Them Given. Burnley have got away with one there.83 min: Stephens channels his inner Beckenbauer and dribbles down the inside-right channel. He reaches the byline and crosses. The ball clatters into Mee’s arm. Saints demand a penalty kick, but there’s a VAR check, and they’re not getting it.81 min: Djnepo drops a shoulder to make space down the left, but his cross is aimless. Cleared.79 min: Ings gifts the ball to Vydra in the centre circle. Burnley flood forward. Eventually Taylor is released into acres down the left. He enters the box and fizzes a fine pass along the corridor of uncertainty. But neither Hendrick nor Rodriguez is on the front foot, and a ball that was begging to be poked home flies harmlessly out for a throw. Burnley really should have put Saints out of their misery, but the home side are still in this.78 min: Armstrong cuts in from the right and has a dig. The shot’s deflected over for a corner, from which the same player shoots, 25 yards out. The effort is as wild as the weather.77 min: Obafemi makes off down the right and is barged over from behind by Tarkowski. Not for the first time this afternoon, the referee does nowt when he should be whistling like billy-o. He’s been poor today.75 min: McNeil sprints off down the left. He’s got options in the box, where there are more green shirts than red. But his pullback for Hendrick is dismal, behind the man, and Hendrick can only drag a weak effort goalwards. Rodriguez intercepts and slots home, but he’s clearly miles offside, and the flag goes up. Burnley should have put this game to bed.74 min: Ings crosses deep from the left. It’s a decent cross, but nobody’s there at the back post. Nobody gambling. Nobody taking a chance. Ings gesticulates at his team-mates accordingly.73 min: Saints throw on another attacker. Obafemi comes on for Walker-Peters.72 min: Taylor burns down the left and wins a corner, from which McCarthy flaps thin air. More displeasure in the stands. Then Bardsley has a crack from the best part of 40 yards. Even in these conditions, that was at the very limit of realistic ambition.70 min: Bardsley nearly feeds Rodriguez down the right. McCarthy comes to the edge of his box to gather, then shanks a clearance straight out of play. The home crowd groan, hoot and holler. They’re not happy with the way Southampton are going about their business right now. They’ve been dismal since conceding the second goal.68 min: Djenpo concedes possession cheaply in the centre circle. Had Vydra been a little livelier, a break was on, but he dawdles and Saints swarm him to rescue the situation. The home crowd are getting a little antsy.66 min: Ward-Prowse and Walker-Peters combine down the right again, the latter whipping a low cross into the mixer. Ings is sniffing around, but it’s Tarkowski who is brightest and snuffs out the attack.64 min: Walker-Peters and Ward-Prowse probe down the right, but can’t find a chink in the Burnley armour. Saints have dominated possession this afternoon, but once again they’re not getting any reward for it. Same old story.62 min: Saints try to strike back immediately, Bertrand having a dig from 25 yards. It looks as though the shot is deflected behind by Tarkowski, but Saints aren’t getting the corner. On the touchline, with the rain flattening his Conan O’Brien quiff, Ralph Hasenhuttl openly seethes. What a goal this is! With the rain swirling like mad, Hendrick launches long from the right, finding Vydra on the edge of the Saints box, with his back to goal. He takes two touches to nudge the ball to the left, turns and larrups a stunner into the top left past a sprawling McCarthy. That’s some finish, and out of nothing, Burnley regain the lead.59 min: McCarthy blooters long. Ings gets the better of Tarkowski down the inside-right channel, but there’s no angle for a shot and his cross is way too high for his partner Long in the centre.58 min: Latest score: Match 0-1 Storm Dennis. More when we have it.56 min: Bardsley goes clattering into Djnepo, becoming the latest player to get away with one. The referee’s decisions are becoming positively psychedelic.54 min: Taylor goes sliding in on Armstrong, out on the right touchline, catching both ball and man. It’s a clear foul, but not given by either lino or ref. The referee is beginning to flirt with Shocker territory.52 min: Vestergaard, quarterbacking from deep, sprays a stunning diagonal ball towards Ings on the right. Ings can’t bring it down. He’d have been clear. What a pass, though.50 min: Vydra turns cutely on the byline, just to the left of the Saints box. Stephens trips him clumsily, but gets away with the foul. Vydra is furious, and he’s got every right. He’d have been away.48 min: Saints establish a modicum of control. They stroke it around the midfield for a while, then Djnepo dribbles down the left and slips a pass inside for Bertrand, who slaps an instant shot into the side netting. He had more time than he thought, and should have done better.47 min: Hectic nonsense in the early stages of this half, as the teams try to come to terms with the wind again.Burnley get the second half underway. No changes.Half-time entertainment. Nick Ames has been poking around Ralph Hasenhuttl’s old gaff. Here’s his report.Saints have been the better team, and Danny Ings scored a marvellous goal. But he was also at fault for Burnley’s preposterous opener, so here we are.45 min +4: The wind is swirling around St Mary’s, and the players are beginning to struggle. Passing sequences at a premium right now. Half time can’t come soon enough.45 min +2: Ings nearly closes down Pope as the keeper dallies over a launch upfield. Not quite, but full marks for the press.45 min: There will be five added minutes.43 min: Mee is booked for his agricultural obstruction of Ings in midfield. No complaints about that one.42 min: Hojberg sends a diagonal ball into the Burnley box from a deep position on the left. Walker-Peters zips in from the other flank and isn’t far away from getting on the end of the cross, but Pope reads the danger well to claim.41 min: The rain continues to fall. The wind still blows. The players are trying their best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f215f5f0fe96a982f8e629f4d2f67142d67edc87/0_2525_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf39bd690ec4145c1764ec803ba51649","title":"experience i made bombs for al qaida","story":"In 1998, two US embassies were bombed, killing 200 Africans. I no longer wanted to be part of itI grew up in Saudi Arabia, the youngest of six brothers. By the time I was 13, I had lost both my parents: my father in a traffic accident and my mother to a brain aneurysm.Not long after they died, in 1992, the Bosnian war began. The evening news detailed atrocities perpetrated against defenceless Muslims, and the papers praised the bravery of the Saudi men who went to fight alongside them. My eldest brother had lectured us on the importance of fighting in defence of Islam, and when I learned that a childhood friend had decided to join the Bosnian mujahideen, I felt someone was paving the way for me.I found the training empowering. A few weeks earlier I’d been a bookish nerd living in a conservative police state. Now I was in a training camp, high in the mountains, holding my first AK-47. It was intoxicating. I became a committed jihadist – when we were shot at, the adrenaline would take over and I’d retaliate. Always, I was willing to die. In the back of my mind, was the thought: this could be the day I cross into eternal bliss.I met al-Qaida’s Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who would go on to mastermind 911, at a wedding after the Bosnian war ended, where he spoke passionately about the need to rid the Muslim world of American influence. He persuaded me to begin training with them. Before the year was out I had met Osama bin Laden and sworn an oath of allegiance.Still only 19, I was put to work training new recruits who often lacked even basic knowledge of Islamic theology and history. Many enrolled just to escape dire poverty in Yemen. Later, I made explosives and chemical and biological weapons. I was fascinated by the science, and pushed the potential consequences out of my mind. I thought these bombs were to be used on US military bases in the Middle East, and the possibility of civilian casualties never occurred to me.When news of the bombing of two US embassies in east Africa reached us in 1998, it was a turning point – 200 innocent Africans killed just to get at 12 American diplomats. When I asked an al-Qaida leader how this had been justified, he mentioned a 700-year-old fatwa that excused the killing of civilians. I felt we were twisting our principles past breaking point. I no longer wanted to be part of it.I used a planned health check-up as a pretext for travelling to Qatar. I had no intention of returning, and it was a relief when I was arrested on arrival for suspected terrorism offences. I confessed immediately to my al-Qaida involvement – as far as I was concerned, this was fate.I was relocated to the UK for seven months of debriefings. During that time, many of my long-held beliefs were erased by the kindness I was shown. I had been trained to view westerners as animals, yet here I was having meals and lengthy discussions with decent people.When I was asked to spy on behalf of MI5 and MI6, I agreed straight away. For the next eight years, I travelled regularly between London and Afghanistan: as far as al-Qaida were concerned, I was running money and equipment and helping them recruit in the UK. Instead, I would commit information to memory and smuggled back to MI6 the designs of a device to disperse deadly chemical agents.I knew the risks, and had sleepless nights. But my time as a double agent didn’t end until 2006, when classified information about my work was leaked to journalists, and information that inadvertently blew my cover was published in Time magazine. I learned this while on holiday, when I got a text from an al-Qaida colleague saying, “There is a spy among us.” They hadn’t realised the spy was me.Eventually, a fatwa was issued against me, and three years ago security services uncovered a plot to kidnap and murder me, hatched by a former al-Qaida ally. By that time I was married and my wife was five months’ pregnant. But I have no regrets about working for the west – I know planned attacks were foiled thanks to the intelligence I gathered, and many lives were saved.I still live in the UK, and co-host a podcast using my experience to shine a light on the Middle East I also work as a security consultant. I will never feel entirely safe, but I take what precautions I can.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

Looking back, it seems so dangerous.My mother grew up in rural Belgium and one day she brought home my father – the kid from Africa. That was a big contrast for a local family then. But it shows we can all progress and keep progressing.As the child of a migrant, you quickly learn about inequality. My parents told me: “You will have to work twice as hard as kids from other backgrounds.” I thought: “OK, if I work twice as hard, I will be twice as good.”My neighbourhood had a lot of gangs, but I would remind kids in the same situation that the world is a lot bigger than the place you know and want to dominate, and it is full of opportunities. You just need a goal. Mine was football. It’s easy to take the wrong path, but what happens on the next street corner could define the rest of your life.Celebrating a goal in front of thousands of fans is a weird experience. Before I hit my long-range goal for Manchester City against Leicester in May, which helped us to win the Premier League title, a teammate shouted: “Don’t shoot!” And I thought: “Why not? Let me do what I want!” My happiness was a mix of rage and adrenaline exploding together.Suffering racist abuse inspires the same feelings in me as any other injustice: anger and revolt. I used to respond, but now I look at the bigger picture: where can I voice my opinion and complain? And what is the ersity of that governing body? Populism upsets me. It’s a dangerous game played by people who understand the implications of what they do, but are just too driven to win. We need serious debate.

I’d spent two years after leaving school on the minimum wage working in a chain-store stockroom. Her parents worked for a lender that called itself a “personal loan company” because it liked to think it bonded with clients by visiting them in their homes. I would have to canvas for custom by leafleting homes in impoverished postcodes. When someone applied for a loan I’d go to their home bringing cash in an envelope and I’d have to knock on doors collecting the repayments. I’d earn commission which meant the more money I forced out of people the more money I would make. I saw families broken and people dying. I felt like a fly on a corpse.That experience has shaped my view of money and what it does to people. I was earning £800 a week, but realised that capitalism is not worth the damage it does. It also reinforced a lifelong feeling that I was the odd one out. Eventually it broke me. One New Year’s Day I rang the office and told them I was done.I sold my collection of vintage video games and consoles for £1,000 to self-publish a comic book about my mental health. Art helps me process situations and I found myself drawn to superheroes to escape myself. The sales funded print runs of more comics, culminating in a book about my experiences with the loan company. This earned me £1,672 which gave me the confidence to approach big companies with samples and win commissions from Hollywood film studios illustrating official movie memorabilia. Comics never make much money so I took a £12,000-a-year job in a shop which enabled me to get a mortgage on an £80,000 flat, and I did my drawing in the evenings.But in 2017 I was hospitalised after a suicide attempt. Everything was breaking down at the same time. A car accident had left me in a leg brace. I left the job due to bullying and lost my partner and friends who could not cope with my self-harming, outbursts and panic attacks. It was only after that that I was diagnosed with autism. It hit me really hard. During the wait for a referral, I was housebound and supported by family and small employment and support allowance payments since I was deemed fit to work.I discovered that there were no books to help me that weren’t academic or aimed at parents or children so I decided to use comics as a way of reinventing myself. I pitched the result, Reaffirmation: Coming to Terms with an Autism Diagnosis to a publisher but the process was taking too long so I pulled out and crowdfunded it. It raised £4,758 after celebrity support on social media so I invested an extra £242 to print it in hardback.Comics have given me a voice. They started out as escapism. I was a rebel without a cause and needed something to give me one. My autism has shown me a way to help make the world a better place. I’ve gone from the guy taking money off people to an autism advocate. I still have a lot of phobias about leaving the house. I don’t take holidays or eat out and I struggle to cook for myself. My parents drive me to Aldi at night when it’s emptier and I spend about £30 a week on microwavable food. But I’m hungry to be going out and socialising.I’ve always wanted to be secure by 30 and I feel I’m on that path, scraping by on savings but with the potential to do something big. I’m a consultant for a proposed new autism training hub for councils and I earn enough to pay my £345 a month mortgage from Amazon royalties and my film work. I’d be worried if I wasn’t scared about the future. Things that have happened in my life have been bigger than me and the minute I start to become casual about what I’m doing is the minute I should question whether I’m doing it right. I want to prevent others from falling between the cracks as I did. Somebody shouldn’t be found half dead on the floor before people take notice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd24a0a85e93fa84fa30b61463eeba96263b11d6/0_356_1095_657/master/1095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0bb526e851d15750c38ea1d4e36274","title":"i appreciate humanity now king krule on punk parenthood and finding peace","story":"Pop’s angry young man Archy Marshall on moving to Cheshire, singing to his daughter and writing his best ever albumSome time towards the end of 2019, Archy Marshall, AKA King Krule, found himself in Warrington standing on a wide stretch of ankle-high grass. Behind him, smoke curled into the wintry sky above Fiddlers Ferry power station. With the sun setting over its chimneys, he picked out drowsy notes on his guitar, singing deeply over the top.What on earth was the flame-haired singer up to, miles from his south London home, his Fender Mustang hanging loosely over his shoulder? As it turns out, Marshall has a new stomping ground these days, having moved to the north-west after his partner became pregnant in 2018, to be closer to her family. “I left this city and went up there and it feels great,” he says as we settle at a table in the pub near his mum’s house back south, to the west of Peckham Rye. It is another cold evening, and he is in London rehearsing in preparation to tour Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule. The story behind the trip to the power station became clear before Christmas, when Marshall uploaded a grainy video titled Hey World! to YouTube. Along with footage of four new songs were shots of snow, the moon and copious electricity pylons (Marshall’s current fixation). His girlfriend, who was heavily pregnant during parts of the recording, was behind the camera. “I was super cold in front of that power station – I remember after five or six takes I was like: ‘Fucking hell, my fingers are falling off.’”But Marshall’s freezing digits were worth it: Hey World! is both an intriguing intro to his new record and a window into a new, calmer stage of his life in Cheshire’s wide expanses. Having left the grime and grind of London, things have changed for the 25-year-old, who first emerged as a snarling, hollow-cheeked teen in the 2011 video for the searing Out Getting Ribs and built a reputation for angry, tender songwriting, blackened by the stories of his young life.That debut single sparked pandemonium, and after a self-titled EP laid out his untamable vision for a new sound built from jazz, hip-hop, punk and his beloved no-wave, 2013 debut album 6 Feet Beneath the Moon cemented him as a thrilling new voice. Bile and brilliance spewed from his lean frame in equal measure. Tracks such as Border Line and Ceiling had plenty of the former, while Baby Blue and Ocean Bed showed his deft touch for a love song. Beyoncé posted a link to Easy Easy (a bellowed rock’n’roll number about nicking stuff from Tesco in Surrey Quays) on Facebook, and Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Earl Sweatshirt began sniffing around for collaborations. Marshall, meanwhile, told MTV he “wasn’t surprised” Beyoncé was into his stuff.In 2014, under his real name, he released A New Place 2 Drown, a tripped-out LP that came with a companion art book made with his brother. The hype spread internationally as Marshall toured, and in 2017, his expansive second King Krule album The Ooz won him a Mercury nod, by which time he had become something of a counterculture icon. All the while, he drank in the same pubs and did his bit to promote the scene he came from, supporting south London music and ensuring that its bars and DIY venues still hosted King Krule shows. After one riotous gig in Bermondsey before The Ooz came out, he left to tour the US. He remembers that period as “a really inspiring time”, and things would change dramatically once it was over.Upon his return to London, Marshall discovered that his girlfriend, who had been on the road documenting proceedings, was pregnant. Their baby, Marina, was born in March last year. He scratches his head as if to crank its contents into gear. “When she was born, she was the biggest expression of life and love, but I also lost some good people last year,” he says. “Those juxtapositions between death and such extreme life must have had an effect on me.”As much as this reclusive character might not favour the idea, for King Krule fans the new outlook represents big news. Marshall’s skin-pricking, red-raw songs have always affected people. He says some fans have been sharing their emotional connections with him for as long as he’s been releasing music. The former Brit School pupil was always confident he would do well, but he has tried to foster a low-key approach, shunning the limelight in favour of pints, roll-ups and splurges of restless creativity.Even so, his every move fascinates. Each new morsel, sonic or visual, still brings a blizzard of attention. Pitchfork even ran a news story about his impending fatherhood. Marshall has always remained distant, an approach he adopted while dabbling in misdemeanours as a teen as he shuttled between his parents’ separate houses. But now, the mellow scent of change is in the air.Recorded in London and Stockport with saxophonist Ignacio Salvadores and co-producer Dilip Harris, Man Alive! was made, like its predecessors, by night. Initially, Marshall drew inspiration from thinking about the many head injuries he has suffered from assorted accidents in his life (he decided against displaying a lurid painting of one on the cover). Mostly, though, he wrote about his changing surroundings. He recalls strange twilit occurrences during recording, such as the night he dozed off with a Johnny Rotten interview in his headphones and awoke to the sound of a random self-help demo, or the time he came to and found an inexplicable crack across his laptop screen.But such atmospheres colour only sections of the album. It arcs from the King Krule staples of guttural anger and noise (the rumbling Supermarché, Stoned Again’s rough and tumble, the nerve-jangling Comet Face), to lush guitars and zen-like contentment (Airport Antenatal Airplane, which samples Nilüfer Yanya’s voice and is dedicated to his daughter, and Please Complete Thee, arguably Marshall’s purest song yet). Even the sedative Alone, Omen 3, written about finding empowerment in depression, feels joyous. A patchwork of sampled voices and field recordings add to Man Alive!’s pleasantly dazed atmosphere. On the record – which, at 40 minutes, is his shortest so far – there is a sense that something inside him is thawing. “I see a beauty in everything that I knew was always there, but I can understand it a lot more now,” he says. “I really like the beauty in the lows, the highs, the hatred and the love, I appreciate humanity, the people around me and conversation. I’m more open, accepting and interested.”Now more than ever, Marshall is endeavouring to stay bullshit-free. He’s smoking and drinking less, too. Inside his head, he has barely deviated from the time back in 2012 when his mother Rachel, a costume designer and artist, doubled as his manager. He eventually signed up with XL Recordings and Adele’s management company, but family has always been more important to King Krule. Marshall’s brother Jack does his album art, while their dad Adam, an art director, contributed spoken word on The Ooz and paintings for the new record, the title of which was pilfered from the boys’ musician uncle, whose images of pylons (see, we told you he was obsessed) also adorn the inlay. Pylons pop up again in the lyrics to The Dream, a mumbled lullaby about halfway through Man Alive! that sums up its entire mood.When the singer leans back and says: “I’m simple in a lot of ways. I’ve got simple pleasures,” it’s easy to understand. “I never took that step that I guess was expected. I have kept things very similar to when I started. I’ve always been conscious of my integrity in a sense of when to accept big cheques. I was lucky I had a core group of people around me that I loved.”Marina’s arrival means that group now has a new member, and Marshall’s face lightens every time he talks about her. His latest side project, he reveals, is “writing kids’ songs that are stupid as hell I make them up for her and translate them on to the guitar, 80s Robert Wyatt-style.” That process started when Marshall would rock her to sleep. “She sleeps longer than me, man. I’ve been blessed, it’s been pretty easy because of how good she is,” he explains. “She loves music. She loves to stare at the guitar and she loves to strum it and feel the vibration of the strings. She wants to climb it, she wants to hit it.”Marshall approached Man Alive! in the same spirit. He enjoyed uprooting to a new studio in Stockport, where there was “a comfier chair” and two engineers who could go blow-for-blow with Marshall working through the night. The Hey World! film also finds him playing a small pink guitar with unicorns printed on it, borrowed from his partner’s younger sister. But don’t take the piss, he warns: “People saw it and thought it was a ukulele … Fuck that, no way!”These songs, he says, have taken him back to the crux of King Krule. “It was just me and my instrument, an instrument that I’ve been in love with since I was eight years old, one that has looked after me and given me success, love, hate and all these things.” Marshall wants his listeners to feel these new songs “deep in their bones” just like he does, and is excited to get back into “method acting” on tour next month. “I just love the theatre of music. I think about one little image of me, writing something down or something happening to me and I’m there,” he says. “This record sounds really good live. I just want to go and play it.”Man Alive! is out from Friday 21 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e52bb8830a60f547c53fc9d69b6f1f2824860d/0_259_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91317d6206d7ea49142fac297f0ccce8","title":"johnny flynn renaissance man to regency hero emma film","story":"Being a fictional hero was once a more straightforward business. You were handsome, you were honourable and brave: you were in. Colin Firth only had to dampen his white shirt a little to update Jane Austen’s most famous romantic lead, Mr Darcy, in the hit 1995 television adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.But changing times call for a fresh approach. And so the portrayal of Mr Knightley, hero of the latest big-screen version of Austen’s Emma, has been the subject of much speculation ahead of the film’s opening on 14 February.Johnny Flynn, actor, musician and renaissance man, has the tricky job of measuring up to every Austen fan’s dreams of George Knightley, the wise and kindly figure who has always rivalled the more austere Darcy in readers’ affections.Newspaper headlines so far have inevitably focused on a scene in which Flynn appears nude. “Move over Mr Darcy!” cried the Daily Mail.If Flynn, who will also appear on screen this year as David Bowie in Stardust, as well as in British film The Dig, already looks familiar, it is because of his recent role in the BBC serialisation of Les Misérables, or as the dependable William Dobbin in ITV’s Vanity Fair. Yet the actor, 36, says he knew from the start that he had to handle Knightley with especial care. Quite apart from the line in the novel where his character admits to having loved Emma Woodhouse, 16 years his junior, since she was 13 years old, Knightley also does a fair amount of moral lecturing. Something the director, Autumn de Wilde, admits can read today like “mansplaining”.The nude scene is defended by Flynn and his American director as a piece of historical authenticity (“They didn’t wear underpants in Regency England,” says Flynn) and as a way of balancing out all that mansplaining. De Wilde told Flynn she would be objectifying his body “for a minute”, in the same way that women have endured down the ages, to make him more appealing to the audience.The actor, who was born in South Africa, came to Britain at the age of two. His parents were anti-apartheid campaigners, who had been hounded by government police and wanted a new life. They settled first in Hampshire, then in Wales. Eric, his late father, was an actor with two sons from a previous marriage who would also go into performing for a living. One of them is Jerome Flynn of Robson \u0026amp Jerome chart-topping fame.His mother, Caroline, a ceramicist and artist, gave the young Flynn her old 1970s songbook and so helped to spark his other career as a star of the British folk music scene. Flynn says he was also inspired when he found the album The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan at a school jumble sale at the age of 11: “I remember listening to that record and crying on my own in my bedroom.”He taught himself guitar soon afterwards, and now also plays the violin and trumpet.After gaining him a choral scholarship to Winchester, his musical skills also won him a place at the liberal boarding school Bedales, alma mater to Daniel Day-Lewis and Lily Allen. Drama school came next, followed by a lead role in the children’s movie Crusade in Jeans.Flynn then joined Ed Hall’s Propeller theatre company, all the while pursuing his musical ambitions with his first band, Apocalypso. Playing now with the band the Sussex Wit, he has become a stalwart of the resurgent English country sound. In 2008, the revered Rolling Stone columnist David Fricke picked out Flynn’s debut album A Larum as one of his favourites of the year. He has since toured America with Mumford \u0026amp Sons and Laura Marling, but for many he only truly reached the heights when he wrote and sang the theme tune for the admired British television comedy Detectorists.Last month, Radio 3 listeners had the chance to hear Flynn’s latest composition, a musical which has as unlikely a theme as any surprise hit, and which Stephen Fry has judged “wondrous”. Created with his friend, Robert Hudson, it tells the story of a tax adviser’s struggle to uncover a massive fraud, of his imprisonment by the authorities, and of an American financier’s crusade for justice.In song and satire, Magnitsky the Musical describes the origins, and the effects of the Magnitsky Act, the piece of global legislation which now allows governments to sanction anyone they see as a human rights offender.Among other recent Flynn successes has been his stage performance in the West End and on Broadway in the acclaimed Martin McDonagh play Hangmen, and his 2017 film role opposite Jessie Buckley in the psychological thriller Beast, set on Jersey.In America, audiences probably know the actor best for the Netflix comedy Lovesick, set in Glasgow, which follows a young man in his unsavoury quest to tell all his previous girlfriends that he has chlamydia.Flynn’s own love life has had a simpler, if twisting, path. He met his wife, Beatrice Minns, as a fellow sixth-former at Bedales, and she made an immediate impact: “I was very shy as a teenager but completely in love with her. There was just something about her that I felt a real connection to.”The couple repeatedly broke up and reunited during their teens and 20s, including a period when Flynn followed Minns out to New York. They now have three children, and Minns works as a designer for the Punchdrunk theatre group. “There’s always been a sense of destiny,” Flynn has said.Whether Flynn can convince contemporary audiences that fate should also bring his Knightley and Anya Taylor-Joy’s Emma together on screen remains to be seen. Can his take on the reserved and fatherly Knightley convince us that he is deserving of such a feisty prize?What we can say is that Flynn, who follows the swarthy Mark Strong, Johnny Lee Miller and Jeremy Northam in playing the famous role, is the first blond actor to have been given a run at one of English literature’s ultimate romantic heroes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4249f7c9c58a1d1cc9b2f55923c8fda799514608/0_893_1989_1193/master/1989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30829344b25359f55c3c08a06073c173","title":"one to watch angelica garcia cha cha palace mexican american","story":"Barack Obama is among the fans of this vibrant indie singer whose music celebrates her Mexican-American heritage“Enough with the Cadillacs and the Hampton estates,” snarls Angelica Garcia on It Don’t Hinder Me, an arresting whirlwind of a track that sounds like Bikini Kill crashing a rooftop party in Mexico City. Instead of these faded markers of American glory, the 26-year-old Mexican-Salvadoran-American wants to talk about “mango peeling in the kitchen at night”, about “the cooking that my grandmother made”, about “guava trees”.Garcia’s forthcoming second album, Cha Cha Palace, is full of hyper-specific moments like this, evoking vibrant vignettes from her upbringing in the Latinx community of southern California, via the east coast. Early 90s indie meets reggaeton and dancehall beats, along with traditional Mexican ranchera music (her mother, a Latin pop and mariachi singer, and grandmother both feature). Garcia’s voice ranges from sounding like she’s invoking ancient deities to a scowling teenager who doesn’t want to tidy her room.It’s a winning combination. Barack Obama chose her song Jícama, a short, sweet celebration of Mexican-American culture, as one of his favourites of 2019. “This song is about not being seen for having a dual identity,” Garcia has said. “The US is a country made up of people from other countries. This song and video are a love letter to kids who grew up embracing two worlds just like me.”Cha Cha Palace is released on 28 February on Spacebomb"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4b607d0351b577b8e7e1e204271afd38e5f2f6/0_84_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f22d6fe533afe82c718faafb1e3ad34","title":"tame impala the slow rush review kevin parker","story":"Around the time of 2015’s Currents – the third Tame Impala album – mainman Kevin Parker described having an epiphany some time previously. Driving around Los Angeles on magic mushrooms and cocaine, he realised just how magnificent the Bee Gees sounded, emotionally and technically. Parker is an Australian man given to singing beatific, double-tracked harmonies in falsetto he is also a studio nerd with a long and attentive study of psychedelia behind him. The sound of the Bee Gees on mushrooms insinuated itself into Parker’s work, culminating in a massive and deserved hit album.Currents was an album all about transition, on which Parker disentangled himself, as gently as he could, from a relationship to begin anew. At the same time, this progenitor of the 00s revival in psychedelic rock was also outgrowing his early sound, a monomaniacal stoner guitar fuzz. Parker embraced the expansive possibilities of electronics, of the dancefloor, of popularity. The mainstream, it turned out, was in a similar headspace: riding an uptown funk renaissance, high on weird production and flirting shamelessly with soft rock.If anything, The Slow Rush – a much-delayed sequel – only pushes up the faders on the funky disco and aerated male vocals. It leans further towards the brothers Gibb than the psilocybin stash. Parker actually told Billboard recently that he now has pop super-producer Max Martin in his sights.You’d be hard-pressed to identify a guitar on The Slow Rush. Instead, Borderline channels the bittersweetness of the late 70s dancefloor through expensive studio technology. Breathe Deeper is an easy funk roll abetted by runs of bejewelled piano that cut across the rhythms. Glimmer is basically a house track. Is It True seems made for throwing shapes on a dancefloor – the kind that might end in the splits. We’re not in the Perth underground any more, Toto.Although long-time listeners will grasp that all this resonant slickery comes originally from outsiderdom – Parker is a perfectionist gear-monkey whose second album was called Lonerism – it now sounds sleek and polished, the work of a gilded insider ELO updated by Daft Punk. Parker’s signature sonic disorientation remains, but the wobbliness takes a backseat to making a very big audience dance. Lost in Yesterday gets it right, with a galumphing 80s bassline that would sound smug if it weren’t strafed by analogue burbles and a terrific lyric about false nostalgia.As The Slow Rush builds, you have to hold on tight to the idea that, despite the musical lengths Parker used to go through to camouflage his lyrics, he is actually one of our most intriguing confessional singer-songwriters. Its hazy thermals notwithstanding, Currents tugged on the heartstrings as Parker struggled to decide which urges to honour and which to discount – a state of disquiet that contrasted with the stately glide of his music.That luminous emotional core is harder to locate on The Slow Rush. But it is there. It helps to know that, while writing these songs, Parker had to flee a Malibu Airbnb in 2018 clutching only his laptop, a hard drive and his 1960s vintage Höfner bass – the kind Paul McCartney plays – as forest fires consumed the neighbourhood.Parker’s complex relationship with his father has formed the backbeat to a number of his songs. Posthumous Forgiveness is one album highlight, channelling the heady 60s sounds also beloved of Parker senior. On this ambivalent love song from a grown-up son to the flawed father he lost to cancer in 2009, the drums (Parker’s primary instrument) pummel home the harsher words.If The Slow Rush has an overarching theme, it is the passage of time. (A non-album track that came out last March was called, knowingly, Patience.) The stereo-panned opening track, One More Year, contemplates the emotional distance of 12 months. Many Tame Impala songs sound as if they are unfurling in real time: On Track is a pretty pastorale that sounds like Parker self-soothing about how long his album is taking to make.The Slow Rush also finds Parker fretting openly about continued relevance. “You ain’t as cool as you used to be,” Parker smiles wryly at himself on It Might Be Time. “Will I be known and loved?” he wonders on Borderline. It’s safe to say The Slow Rush will only expand Tame Impala’s audience… and that this thoughtful amalgam of Supertramp and the Weeknd will be inescapable this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95969ba0c659daed958030cd9abaf31cab44332a/785_731_5070_3042/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e5addfdb5f10807fd5b03fba2c451c","title":"the former addicts saving lives with naloxone podcast","story":"Anti-overdose drug naloxone has been in clinical use since the 1970s but not always where it’s needed most. ’s Jamie Grierson visited Redcar in North Yorkshire where a group of former drug users provide at-risk people with kits that could save their lives.

Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

But when Laura Muir and Jemma Reekie are asked about the impact of Nike’s shoe technology during an amiable conversation one can suddenly hear a pin drop. The pair look at each other. A PR person intervenes. The journalists protest and press their case. Nothing is resolved.Earlier the pair’s overly protective coach, Andy Young, had threatened to cancel the interview before it was due to start. He even suggested to his two athletes they should get ready to leave after getting wind that questions about their Nike spikes would be asked.In truth it all felt a little, well, strange. The 26-year-old Muir is one of the brightest athletes in the sport. She could have rightly pointed out that all shoe companies are involved in a technological arms race and that her and Reekie’s Nike spikes are not new and have been declared legal by World Athletics, given the chance.Muir has also had first-hand experience of the change in shoe technology given she finished fifth in last year’s astonishing world 1500m final – in a race where all top eight athletes broke the previous championship record.Meanwhile Reekie, a 21-year-old from Kilbarchan, has set three indoor British records in eight days. The first, over 800m in Glasgow, was by running a lightning quick 1:57.91 – the fastest indoor time since 2006. And she was just as impressive a week later in New York, breaking Muir’s 1500m and mile records.Fortunately the pair are much more effusive when it comes to talking about their relationship as friends, training partners and legitimate contenders for Olympic gold.“I think the faster Jemma’s got, the closer we’ve got,” says Muir.“To have someone like Jemma right on my heels is so good for both of us,” adds Muir. “And, yeah, she’s like a little sister to me. We travel the world together, we race each other. Well, we race each other, a lot more now. So, sorry to disappoint you, but it’s not a big rivalry. We’re not upset with each other – we both work really well.”The 21-year-old Reekie was always considered a talent worth watching and last year won the 1500m and 800m European Under-23 titles. But sinus problems had always held her back.“I used to miss a good few months out of training each year just due to sinus infections,” she explains. “In December I had an operation just to put a stop on that and make sure I’m in the best place I could be for the Olympic year. It’s not benefiting me in any other way other than not missing training.”The difference has been spectacular. But Reekie very much still has her feet on the ground. “I didn’t have a drink to celebrate my national record in the 800m – although I did go out with my parents for dinner,” she says. “They wanted to have a glass or two – so I was their designated driver for the night.”Reekie did not celebrate in New York either. “I had to be up at 5am the next morning to go to the airport,” she adds, smiling.The big regret on Saturday is that the pair will not be racing against each other at the Indoor Grand Prix in Glasgow – despite the best efforts of organisers. Instead Muir will try to break Maria Mautola’s 1,000m world record – while Reekie will go over 1500m.“It’s going to be very close,” says Muir. “If I don’t pace it right, I’m going to be in trouble. But it will be really special if I do it. I’ve got British and European records but never a world record.”However, Muir insists that the pair will not avoid each other – like Britain’s two greatest middle distance runners, Seb Coe and Steve Ovett did for much of the 80s, although she does leave some wriggle room.“We both we run the 800 and 1500m, we both run similar times, so we’re not going to be avoiding it,” says Muir. “We’re going to be doing the same races – well, same competition. So we’re going to clash at some points definitely.”Can they both win medals at this year’s Tokyo Olympics? Muir says they can – but pointed out that, while Reekie is a stunning talent, she needs time to develop and grow as an elite athlete.“I am being very careful because Jemma has raced amazingly but I am wary of piling loads of pressure,” she explained. “I think she is capable of doing very, very special things. To run amazing times is fantastic but you need championship experience as well and Tokyo will be her first Olympics. I want her to enjoy that as best as possible and not have that big, big bit of pressure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d03f8ee6096b98663c979eb36addf524d645e9/0_140_4853_2912/master/4853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2efebe48325667d019d077d9032c316e","title":"six nations first two rounds england wales ireland france scotland italy","story":"Eddie Jones under scrutiny, Wales and Ireland settling into new management regimes, and a fragile French renaissance?After Ciara and Dennis comes storm Eddie? After England overwhelmed New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final the Six Nations seemed a breeze for them, with four teams under new management and Gregor Townsend’s Scotland looking inwards. But it is England’s head coach who is under the most scrutiny after two rounds.Jones’s contract ends in 2021, at the midway point between World Cups, and the sight of Rassie Erasmus, South Africa’s Japan 2019-winning coach, at Murrayfield last Saturday was another cause for speculation. Jones’s side’s meek opening in Paris after the Australian’s bellicose buildup was followed by a narrow win in appropriately stormy conditions but, as the third round looms, England have home advantage.France lead the table on points difference from Ireland having both won their first two matches but they have yet to step out of their own backyards. England have recorded the only away victory so far and have home matches with Ireland and Wales before venturing to Rome on the final weekend.Much is being made of France’s revival under Fabien Galthié and the impact made by Wales’s former defence coach, Shaun Edwards. The only way was up after five years in the championship during which they only once won more matches than they lost, but only Italy have conceded more tries this year than Les Bleus, who are in Cardiff next weekend.France have not won there since 2010. That was also the last time they recorded a third successive victory in a Six Nations campaign, on their way to a grand slam. Since then England, Ireland and Wales have shared the titles and are the sides with the best away records in that time France, Scotland and Italy have 11 away wins between them, as many as Ireland and three fewer than Wales and England.The weekend will show how much France have changed. Wales have not lost at home in the championship since 2017, their winning run of six the longest in the tournament, but they are transitioning from the Warren Gatland era and, under pressure in Dublin last weekend, lost their defensive shape and, apart from their opening try, lacked fluency in attack.Ireland have changed gear after the Joe Schmidt years when they played a relentless possession game through Conor Murray. After a lacklustre opener against Scotland, they attacked with width against Wales, quick to get the ball away from the breakdown. They targeted the debutant Nick Tompkins in Wales’s midfield, as if their head coach, Andy Farrell, had tapped his son, Owen, for the lowdown on the Saracens centre.Whereas France have been sustained by moments of inidual brilliance, led by their scrum-half Antoine Dupont, rather than a coherent collective effort, and Wales are undermined by injuries behind, Ireland represent the main threat to England and the two sides meet at Twickenham a week on Sunday.England have lost seven matches at home since the Six Nations started, four times to Ireland, and only one since 2012, when Schmidt’s side won the grand slam two years ago. Jones resisted attempts to blow him off course after the defeat in Paris, persisting with Tom Curry at No 8 and promoting Willi Heinz from the bench to start at scrum-half.The victory was similar to Jones’s first match in charge, at Murrayfield in 2016, and so was the score, 13-6 compared with 15-9. It was the performance of a team under fire, absorbing pressure before striking on an evening when it was often an advantage not to be in possession. England attempted 162 tackles to their opponents’ 88 and their back row touched the ball nine times compared with Scotland’s 33, but a rearguard action will not sustain them against Ireland.Does Jones want to continue beyond 2021? Does the RFU want him to? Does it have a succession plan in place? England declined in the year after their other two appearances in a World Cup final in the professional era, but it should have been different this time given the younger average age of a squad that looked to be on the up, never mind the manner of the defeat in the final.The Saracens affair has affected them, and not because it has impaired squad morale. Some of Jones’s key players, such as Farrell, Maro Itoje and Mako Vunipola were directly caught up in the salary-cap breaches. They were unaware rules were being flouted but, when they look at a clubmate such as Ben Earl, what can they feel other than guilt?England should be able to play their way out of it but for Scotland the wooden spoon will loom if they lose in Italy. They have lost two matches they should have won, adding to the pressure on Gregor Townsend after an early exit from the World Cup. His most mercurial player, Finn Russell, last weekend went public about his lack of faith in the head coach but the full force of storm Finn will be felt if Scotland join the ruins in Rome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496c46324932963d4f9c2317fc5811a17cb04a02/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c2ce553c8f06dce882dacc4ace4eed6","title":"tiktok bosses tell social media own time","story":"They are some of the most popular videos on the shortform video-sharing app TikTok – clips of uniformed employees, from builders to nurses to supermarket staff, dancing and goofing around in their workplaces.But police forces and other employers are dissuading staff from posting videos, warning that they risk appearing unprofessional and urging them to not let social media “get in the way of doing their jobs”.TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that was downloaded more than two million times a day worldwide last year by users mostly aged between 16 and 34, has already propelled homegrown stars such as 15-year-old Charli D’Amelio to household name status as a result of its viral videos. Now a subsection of the app is proving particularly popular among viewers: people dancing on building sites, in shops, or near police stations or hospitals – and it is those workers who are becoming minor TikTok celebrities.Danny Harris, 35, who works on a building site in central London, first realised he had become famous when he was recognised by staff at a local bakery as being a member of SparksandTarts, a TikTok profile with 34,700 followers.SparksandTarts’ first video, of five labourers performing a roughly choreographed dance on a city-centre rooftop to a song from the musical Pitch Perfect, has been seen a million times since it was posted a month ago. They’ve now posted 10 videos.“It has definitely evolved into its own entity,” said Harris. “We’re having TikTok meetings in our breaks to plan what videos we’re going to try to get out there. It’s becoming more of a part-time job. People are messaging each other at the weekend saying: ‘We should try this video next.’”The idea that the employees may be discovered skiving off work also attracts audiences, Gahan added. “Generally, the more a piece of content can spark that emotional response, the more it’s shared and sparks a response.”Harris and his workmates asked for their London building site not to be identified. “We do this in our breaktimes and after tea, and it’s one of these things where all my bosses are happy with it, but, for the sake of the clients funding this build, it’s probably best we’re not advertising exactly where we are,” he said.That is the fundamental issue many uniformed TikTokers face: while their antics show a different, often more welcoming side to their industry or companies, they run the risk of appearing less than professional.One Tesco employee, Tyler Beattie, earned 65,000 fans for posting videos of himself dancing in his uniform. In a video posted a few weeks ago, Beattie explained he had been banned from uploading any more videos in uniform. (And he did not respond to many requests for comment.)A Tesco spokesperson said: “Social media is a fun way to communicate and share information with others. As representatives of Tesco, we ask all our colleagues to use their judgment, respect and common sense online, and make sure that it doesn’t get in the way of doing their jobs.”However, other Tesco employees continue to post videos from stores in uniform, participating in “challenges” – often carefully choreographed dances to popular songs – that go viral. Nor is it limited to Tesco: videos tagged with the names of the UK’s big four supermarkets have been seen 99 million times on TikTok.Police officers and paramedics are also going viral on the app. One Cheshire police officer recently passed 10,000 TikTok followers for her insights into how the force operates. Clips of her and colleagues driving the streets to Ridin’ by Chamillionaire, and Sound of da Police by KRS-One have been viewed more than 700,000 times.The comments to both videos are ided between those who enjoy the lighthearted look into a police officer’s life, and others who think it a distraction from a very serious job.Peter Caldwell, Cheshire Constabulary’s digital media manager, said: “Social media is one of many channels we use to communicate with the public.” He added that his force has social media guidance it expects staff to follow while at work. “We currently use Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to promote the work of the force – however, with the world of digital media constantly evolving, the guidance also applies to new and emerging social media channels.”For Harris, the popularity of SparksandTarts has come as a surprise. But there is one sure-fire sign they have made the big time on TikTok: a protective and high-vis clothing company has been in touch, asking to send them products they could wear in their videos.So-called “brand deals” are the holy grail for influencers – and it seems they can even be brokered on building sites."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dbb783030357624d5bef0ffb9b34ffbad37f25d/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47694d1225fbd00c3e6b5182c2532a2b","title":"chinese sci fi and spanish superheroes the best global tv you can stream","story":"From Austria’s Succession to a New Zealand drama about randy Norse gods, we bring you the best shows from around the worldArgentina: El Marginal NetflixCrime dramas don’t come much tougher than this saga, in which a prison proves so hard to police that the penal powers leave it to its own devices.

Who will she give the thumbs down to in tonight’s final?Feels gladiatorial, doesn’t it – a baying and screaming crowd, chanting in violent unison, demanding Denise van Outen rip her own head off. Perhaps this is the deep truth at the heart of The Masked Singer (Saturday, 7pm, ITV): that it unmasks not its weak singers buried deep within the costume of a monster, but the crowd themselves, the raw and feral omniperson we become when we’re in them. The same crowds that called for Roman slaves to murder each other are present, here, in a pre-record studio somewhere in Hertfordshire. Rita Ora is the emperor, her thumb wavering in the air for a moment, and lo, she does point it down, and what is almost certainly Jason Manford in a hedgehog costume has to pull his own guts out with a sword, for God and for glory.If you have not yet seen ITV’s Saturday night not-quite crown jewel, you have managed to miss absolutely nothing at all, or perhaps everything. The format is something that plunges you into a fever dream: huge unblinking creatures – a monster, a yellow bath duck, a wizened old tree – waddle on to the stage, and perform a song, and we are told a celebrity is inside there, somewhere. A panel of judges – Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, former Community star Ken Jeong when he can be bothered, and Rita Ora – review the song and make frantic, incorrect guesses about who the celebrity inside the beast could be.This is where the show takes on a particular mum-got-too-pissed-at-a-dinner-party air. Rita Ora only knows the names of six celebrities, all of whom you assume she met at London fashion week parties Jeong’s British celeb knowledge is obviously zero, so he has to fake an “of COURSE!” face of realisation when someone like Patsy Palmer is unveiled McCall is oddly anonymous for someone who normally dominates centre stage Ross flaps his hands, wears loud jackets, stabs in the dark. There is no points system for a correct guess they are just guessing for, I don’t know. Fun? I don’t know. The whole thing is a parlour game with a budget of millions and absolutely zero jeopardy. Joel Dommett hosts.If you want to get into it, The Masked Singer UK was ruined irreparably in week two, when former MP Alan Johnson – a man who struggles to get recognised in his own house, by his own family – tore his pharaoh’s head off and revealed yes, it was me all along: Alan Johnson. That was the exact moment every possible bit of glamour that could have been attached to the show withered away. You hope that there is someone A-list inside the duck, someone magnificent: a Cara Delevingne, a George Clooney? And then Justin from the Darkness shakes his hair out of the costume with a face that says: “That tax bill was a touch larger than I was expecting.”Is this our Saturday night? Is this what we deserve to consume alongside our Tesco takeaway for two? Crucially, why are literally none of the performances any good? These questions and more can be answered, I suppose, in tonight’s final, when “Queen Bee” takes her own head off, and Jonathan Ross pulls his hair back from his face in shock, and a second series gets commissioned as surely as the Earth goes around the sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6fc54ac7c9e91cac8b5c119a37186430dd25c5e/0_77_4640_2785/master/4640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4062a52928c370812cc8a265d40968ab","title":"pete buttigieg san francisco queer activists fundraiser","story":"Fundraiser highlights ision as growing number of LGBTQ+ voters say his views don’t represent themAt the center of San Francisco’s National LGBTQ Center for the Arts, two queer activists stood up and disrupted a private fundraiser for Pete Buttigieg after he received a question from the audience about his husband, Chasten.The packed room quickly booed down the activists, drowning out their pointed questions on Friday with chants of “Boot-Edge-Edge! Boot-Edge-Edge!” as they were escorted out of the building.“I respect your activism, but this is a gathering for supporters of our campaign and I just got a question about my husband and I’m really excited to answer it,” Buttigieg quipped from stage, drawing strong applause from the crowd.The activists were part of a group protesting outside the event that reflected a growing disquiet among the LBGTQ+ community when it came to the Buttigieg campaign. Buttigieg may be the first openly gay candidate to sweep the national stage and perform as well as he has in Iowa and New Hampshire, but more and more young queer voters say they feel he is not representative of them or their experiences.“I’m definitely proud of the fact that a gay candidate has made it thus far, but it’s hard to enjoy or appreciate when his stances are so middle of the road and speak to a predominantly white, upper class audience,” Celi Tamayo-Lee, one of the activists escorted out of the fundraiser, said in an interview before the event.Friday’s protesters cited many of the same issues that members of the LGBTQ+ community nationwide say are giving them pause – Buttigieg’s unwillingness to support Medicare for All, free college for all, his issues with communities of color, his ties to billionaire donors – all issues that are not specific to the LGBTQ+ community but still affect them at certain intersections.“We need better, we deserve better,” Adiel Pollydore, a 26-year-old program director with Student Action who is black and queer, told the . “There’s a level of irony that this event costs hundreds of dollars to attend in the Mission, a historically Latinx and immigrant neighborhood. What does it say that this event is not accessible to the folks that live in the neighborhood where it’s being held?”Tickets to the fundraiser started at $250.  received a ticket from a donor associated with the groups organizing the protests.“You’re homophobes, that’s what you all are, you’re homophobes!” a Buttigieg supporter yelled at the protesters after the event.“We’re all gay!” a protester responded.“You interrupted that question,” the Buttigieg supporter said, walking toward Tamayo-Lee. “You’re deplorable.”“Don’t walk up on us,” another protester said, shielding Tamayo-Lee.“You’re walking up on us, going up on us because we’re gay men,” the supporter responded. “You’re horrible.”The group quickly reset after that interaction, chanting, “Hey Pete! Come out, we got some things to talk about!”“The people who disrupted that fundraiser were all queer people of color,” Pollydore said. “We’re allowed to want the gay candidate who is running to do better and be better for queer communities of color. There’s nothing homophobic about that.”While Buttigieg has been open about his sexual orientation, with his husband Chasten playing a large role in the campaign, Pollydore felt there was a level of erasure in the way Buttigieg spoke about and presented LGBTQ+ issues.“Pete Buttigieg represents a very small percentage of the experiences of queer and trans people in this country, being white and being cisgender and being a man, being someone who is highly educated,” Pollydore said. “We know queer and trans folks of color, especially black queer and trans folks, live at the intersection of so many systems of oppression in this country. This run for president could have been a really unique opportunity to lift up those experiences and talk about all the different ways we are criminalized and our safety is constantly threatened and we are shut out of institutions on the regular. But this campaign has not been about that.”Before the event, the line of Buttigieg supporters wrapped around the block to enter, with protesters chanting and waving signs while people waited. Some supporters seemed flummoxed by their presence. “Queers against Pete?” one attendee questioned, reading their signs.“We’re on the same team,” someone muttered.“What’s the point?” someone else said. “Just vote for your candidate. Don’t tear down the others.”“You’re coming to San Francisco, the heart of gay activism in America,” Emily Lee, director of the San Francisco Rising Action Fund, said in an interview. “You need to actually respond to the people of San Francisco who identify as gay or queer. It’s a very fitting place to be asking him these hard questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5d714a1d70e3dbcf94f17c4e4cec2d5525e0c9/0_0_3628_2176/master/3628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7728e4e1e0b05e51bff1b56065aae61a","title":"bernie sanders democratic centrists alarm","story":"The self-described democratic socialist would spell disaster for down-ballot Democrats, party moderates are warningBernie Sanders’ win in New Hampshire should delight progressives, but it will not be without consequences. His victory has put a target on his back, supporters fear, with well-funded centrist Democrats and allied organizations sharpening their knives as they attempt to scupper his newly won frontrunner status.Candidates including Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have repeatedly warned that Sanders would lose to Trump – despite evidence suggesting otherwise – but each has broadened their attacks in the past days to suggest that nominating Sanders would also spell disaster for House and Senate Democrats.In the coming week, meanwhile, a Democratic Super Pac that spent $700,000 running anti-Sanders ads in Iowa is set to repeat the effort in Nevada, which votes on 22 February.“You’re going to absolutely see significant money behind centrists, moderates, whatever, to defeat Sanders,” said Democratic strategist Andrew Feldman.“Bernie is absolutely going to see intensified scrutiny. He was never in this position of the frontrunner in the 2016 race, and you’re going to see things from a long career come out that people are gonna go after.”The Democratic Majority for Israel Pac ran an anti-Sanders campaign in Iowa, the week before the state’s caucus, highlighting the Vermont senator’s supposed unelectability against Trump, despite polls showing Sanders leading the president nationally. A Quinnipiac study released on 10 February showed Sanders eight points ahead of Trump – the biggest margin of any candidate other than the billionaire media mogul Mike Bloomberg.Alongside the argument that Sanders would lose to Trump, what is becoming a more prevalent line of attack is the supposed impact a Sanders nomination would wreak on down-ballot Democrats.Moderate members of Congress, who support Sanders’ rivals, have lined up this week to paint a dystopian vision of a Sanders nomination.“Elected officials across the country understand there will be down-ballot carnage to the Democratic party if we elect the wrong person,” Congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Biden’s campaign, told the New York Times.Dina Titus, congresswoman from Nevada and another Biden backer, suggested that with Sanders as the nominee “you’re not going to take back the Senate”.“There’s not any way, because everybody’s going to be tarred with the same brush. We will probably lose seats in the House,” Titus said.Many fear, however, that the main beneficiary of the brewing Democratic party civil war would probably be Donald Trump.“The party and centrists and different factions within it have to be very careful about the way they go after Sanders, because it plays right into Trump’s hands if we look completely in disarray,” Feldman, the founder of Feldman Strategies, said.“Comments about how people don’t like Bernie are not beneficial to our ultimate goal of beating Donald Trump.”The claims that the leftwing Sanders would spell disaster for other Democrats are also tempered by the likelihood that Trump and his allies will portray whoever wins the nomination as an out-of-control socialist.Trump has already characterized the Democratic party as a whole as the “Do Nothing, Radical Left Dems!”, whether referring to the House of Representatives, the Senate, Sanders or otherwise. It seems unlikely he will change his rhetoric even if the nominee is clearly not a member of the left.Centrist Democrats also run the risk of alienating Sanders supporters ahead of November. Sanders has proved himself to be the only Democratic candidate capable of inspiring the same energy among his supporters as Trump, and the party risks alienating his swath of enthusiastic supporters across the country through further attacks.“They’re here,” read the subject line of an email Sanders sent to supporters on Thursday. The message pointed to the planned Democratic Majority for Israel ad campaign in Nevada, but also to VoteVets, a Buttigieg-supporting Pac which is planning its own spend in the state.“We’re not just competing with other candidates … we are competing with Super Pacs and billionaires too,” the Sanders email said.“We’ve got the momentum. The political establishment and billionaire class know it. If our movement stands together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.”In campaign speeches, Sanders tells his supporters they must unite behind whoever is the Democratic nominee, but if Sanders supporters have spent months watching their candidate lambasted by the Democratic establishment, there should be concern about their reaction if Sanders misses out.“I’m concerned that the more we alienate them the harder it’s going to be to unify for the general, and the reality is that we need everyone’s supporters here,” Feldman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c4be1071dd49f50c7d02da9fc78628da5e9175b/643_49_1253_752/master/1253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12c507a5b75bfa3473c4b6f61b862f17","title":"the electability business is bernie sanders americas corbyn","story":"Some Democratic observers fear their party is following the British left’s road to defeatby  Jonathan Freedland in New HampshireBritish politics rarely intrudes into a US presidential election. In 1988, Joe Biden was forced to abandon his first bid for the White House after it emerged that he had quoted without attribution a chunk of oratory from the then Labour party leader, Neil Kinnock. In 2016, Donald Trump deployed Nigel Farage as an occasional mascot on the stump, the Brexit victory in that year’s referendum deemed a happy omen that populists could defy the odds and win. In 2020, a third name has surfaced, offered as a cautionary tale to a Democratic party that this week confirmed a septuagenarian radical socialist and longtime backbench rebel as its frontrunner. That name is Jeremy Corbyn.“I don’t want the Democratic party of the United States to be the Labour party of the United Kingdom,” James Carville, the victorious manager of Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, told audiences on cable TV and in New Hampshire this week, warning that if Democrats nominate Bernie Sanders, they will almost certainly be following Corbyn’s Labour party to defeat.On the US campaign trail, journalists, strategists for rival Democratic candidates, and even the occasional voter cite Corbyn in the case against Sanders, offering the result of December’s UK general election as evidence. A week spent in New Hampshire watching the Vermont senator and his opponents do battle provides some answers to the question many US Democrats are asking themselves: is Sanders fated to be America’s Corbyn – or are the two men, and their two situations, radically different?Team Sanders is understandably reluctant to encourage the parallel. “I didn’t hear that on the streets, I heard it in the bubble,” Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, told the . “The talking heads and the elites said it to try to dismantle Senator Bernie Sanders, to say, ‘Aha, this can’t happen!’” All the same, Turner was keen to add that “both men have a healthy respect for each other”.Yet within minutes of that conversation, the first New Hampshire voter stopped by the  at a polling station in downtown Manchester – retired airline pilot Paul Demars – volunteered, unprompted, that he was voting for Sanders even though “I was nervous about the electability business: it’d be a real bummer if he got Corbyn’d”.The similarities between the men are obvious. Both spent decades on the political margins, regarded as perennial troublemakers with no prospect of gaining national power. To their critics, they remain stubbornly stuck in the 1970s to their admirers, they have stayed unwaveringly true to their principles. They both exude a rumpled authenticity, their appearance – Sanders’ wayward hair, Corbyn’s beard – visible proof that they are not careerist politicians of the usual stripe.Both boast of the scale of their ambition. Corbyn trumpeted Labour’s 2019 manifesto as the most radical programme in a generation, while the warmup track at a Sanders rally is Tracy Chapman’s Talkin’ Bout a Revolution. Both have promised that victory for them would see their respective countries transformed.The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.\u0026nbspThe goal for presidential candidates is to amass a majority of delegates, whose job it is to choose the nominee at the party’s national convention later in the year. In some states, delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis other states split their delegates proportionally among top winners.That has opened up a line of attack against both men which is remarkably similar. Sanders’ opponents criticise him for implausibly offering “free stuff” to voters, just as the last Labour manifesto was lampooned as a wishlist of impossible giveaways. Sanders provokes scepticism from Americans when he says his healthcare plan would not only guarantee free medical care for everyone but also free eyeglasses, hearing aids and dental care. It triggers a chorus of questions about where the money would come from – a chorus with distinct echoes of the reaction that greeted Labour’s pledge of free broadband along with a series of other costly measures. Some policies are identical, such as free university tuition for all.The effect in both cases is to redefine internal party opponents as dull “centrists”, cautious defenders of the status quo. Corbyn did that to rivals Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall when he ran for the Labour leadership in 2015, and Sanders is doing it to Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar now, just as he did it to Hillary Clinton in 2016. If anything, Sanders goes further. Corbyn never suggested his Labour opponents were agents of the City of London, the way Sanders supporters broke into chants of “Wall Street Pete” in New Hampshire last weekend.Which brings us to the followers of both men. The crowds at Sanders rallies are strikingly similar to the audiences that once came out for Corbyn. Huge numbers of young people, especially students, joined by sixty-somethings who are thrilled that, at last, “we have our party back”. The latter group reckons Sanders is returning the party to the best traditions of Franklin Roosevelt, just as Corbyn liked to invoke the glory of 1945 and Clement Attlee.Some Democrats welcome the infusion of much-needed youth and energy that Sanders has brought in, hopeful that the independent senator – he’s still not a registered Democrat – might make good on his promise to expand the electorate and bring in previous non-voters. (That was the promise of Corbyn too.) But others lament what they regard as the aggressive intolerance of the “Bernie Bros”, accusing them of slamming those who dare voice anything but wholehearted devotion to the leader. A report this week described “the swarm” that descended on a leftwing organisation that endorsed Elizabeth Warren rather than Sanders, detailing a level of online abuse that would be familiar to those on the wrong end of what they would call “the Corbyn cult”. When the MSNBC host Chuck Todd quoted an article that had branded Sanders backers digital “brownshirts”, a hashtag campaign by Sanders defenders soon had #SackChuckTodd trending.The result is a wariness in some quarters – most notably among Sanders’ rivals – to attack him directly, for fear of stirring his supporters’ wrath. Several US journalists admit, albeit privately, to a similar nervousness at going too directly after Sanders – a fear that might resonate with at least some of their counterparts in Britain.But if there are similarities, there are glaring differences too. Perhaps most significant is that Bernie Sanders has suffered nothing like the protracted onslaught of criticism that rained down on Corbyn, from press and internal party opponents alike, from the moment he became leader. It’s one reason why many Democrats are sceptical of polls showing Sanders would beat Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Sanders, they say, has never been on the receiving end of serious negative campaigning or even a thorough trawl through his back catalogue of statements and past affiliations (including, for example, to the Socialist Workers party of America). Clinton steered clear of that tactic in 2016, calculating that it would backfire. So Sanders has never experienced the scrutiny that Corbyn endured – not yet, at any rate. When it comes, say the doubters, his numbers will tank.Still, there are some contrasts with Corbyn that might offer Democrats reassurance. For one thing, Sanders has no credible case to answer on antisemitism on the contrary, he identifies strongly as a Jew. A couple of his congressional supporters have made clumsy and insensitive remarks, but that is a world away from the decades-long, personal record of appearances with, and indulgence of, antisemites that proved so toxic for Corbyn.Similarly, while Corbyn was often accused of “siding with his country’s enemies” – note the £20,000 he was paid to be a presenter on the Iranian state network Press TV or his 2009 meeting with Bashar al-Assad – Sanders is rather less vulnerable on that score. Some admiring words for Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas, along with a honeymoon in Moscow, are about the most damaging items on the Sanders charge sheet. That’s largely because of a difference in world view between the two men. While the senator’s chief focus has long been on domestic issues of economic inequality, for Corbyn, opposition to what he would call US imperialism was for many years the defining core of his politics. One illustration: Sanders supported and voted for the Nato-led military intervention over Kosovo in 1999 Corbyn opposed it.There’s one last contrast that should give Sanders supporters cheer. Even Corbyn’s most devoted admirers would never describe him as a great orator. Sanders, though, is a compelling speaker: focused, strong-voiced, able to land a rhetorical riff in a way that usually eludes the Labour leader.Sanders will need all those gifts if he is chosen to take on Trump in November. A leftwing leader fighting a fair-haired populist with only a casual relationship with the truth has the odds stacked against him – as Corbyn knows all too well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfe8aadcbb7a95b63b00cc05ae598e58745603a7/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=112a0383960a9346f36dadf0dfd8b342","title":"from khat to coffee revitalising an age old yemeni crop","story":"In Haraz, farmers and exporters are bringing new life to a globally acclaimed and desired productHaraz, a collection of medieval villages in Yemen’s highlands, feels very far away from the devastation of the country’s civil war. Banks of cloud tumble down green farming terraces and caress the gingerbread-like houses clinging to the mountainside, and the unique environmental conditions create some of the best coffee in the world.Yemen has exported coffee since the 1400s: the Red Sea port of Mokha gives chocolatey coffee its name. Although native to Ethiopia, the coffee plant was developed into the form that gives us the modern beverage by Sufi monasteries in Yemen that shared it with traders and pilgrims. Eventually, coffee made its way to Constantinople (now Istanbul), Baghdad and London, leading to the rise of the coffee house.Today the global coffee industry is worth £61.4bn, making coffee the most valuable trading commodity in the world after oil. Decades of political instability, however, mean that the quality and availability of Yemeni beans has fluctuated – but now a growing handful of dedicated farmers and exporters are determined to restore Yemen’s reputation as the birthplace of black gold.“My family has grown coffee here for 200 years,” said farmer Hassan Ahmed Alsalool, 35. “I had a motorcycle parts shop in Sana’a, but when the war broke out business ed and I struggled to get parts imported from China. I went home and decided to give coffee growing a try. I feel more free here and the work is rewarding. If you are good to the land, it will be good back to you,” he said.Yemen has long suffered from chronic water management problems, an issue exacerbated by the country’s fondness for khat, a mild narcotic leaf chewed by most men. At least half of the water drawn from ever-depleting aquifers for agricultural purposes is used to grow khat, a quick turnaround crop, rather than the corn or millet that the food-insecure country desperately needs.In Haraz, more and more locals are deciding to clear the terraced farmland of khat and grow coffee instead – a move that could revolutionise Yemeni agriculture. Around 2m khat plants in the area have been cut down and replaced with coffee and corn in the last decade.Coffee growing is still hard work: it takes a few seasons for a crop to reach maturity, so many farmers require financing to get started. Small exporting companies such as Mokha Route, Port of Mokha and Mokha Mountain offer interest-free loans and train farmers in the use of moisture analysers, modern drying beds and organic fertilisers.The ripe, red coffee cherries are then picked, dried, aged and the beans separated from the husks by hand.The high altitude terrain is prone to drought, so farmers like Alsalool are constantly building and maintaining small dams to channel run-off rain from the top of the mountains.The difficult conditions mean yields are small but the Haraz product is critically acclaimed worldwide for unique and erse tones of caramel, chocolate, spices and vanilla all the way though to aromas of lemon, guava, forest berries and apple.The Saudi-led blockade of Yemen’s airspace and borders, which poses significant challenges to getting fuel, medicine and food into the country, also creates problems for fledgling coffee exporters.Alasool sells his coffee for $18 (£13.8) a kilogram. The sought-after product is then sold to buyers mainly in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan and the US, where it can sell for almost $500 a kilogram – the most expensive, and arguably the best, coffee in the world.Buyers like Ahmed Taher of Mokha Mountain are proud to pay Haraz’s farmers and producers well to encourage best practices and re-establish Yemen’s coffee industry.“It’s been very hard work establishing the farmers’ collective here but we are very optimistic about the future and the growth of the business. The demand is very high, understandably, for our high quality product.“I never thought that the war would have an upside, but so many of us have rediscovered our roots in our ancestral villages and the practices that sustained our fathers and grandfathers. It is a very special tradition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84692281f0d48d67c1a2c1a0c8f37a5ff76f8a4d/0_49_1968_1181/master/1968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=575db7648122b6b115acd4864d04f76d","title":"emmanuel macron sets out 10 year vision for eu with call for more integration","story":"French president says EU must have effective defence policy, larger budget and integrated capital marketsEurope’s middle classes will only remain reconciled to the European Union if it is more integrated with an effective defence policy, a larger budget, integrated capital markets and shorn of vetoes that slow decision-making, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said.Setting out his 10-year vision for Europe on Saturday, he said he still wanted to see the UK involved in defence, but urged Europe to recognise that in terms of social welfare it had a different values to the US.Europe, he said, was reaching the hour of truth, the moment when it must decide about greater integration and commonality. He warned: “If the Franco-German tandem do not come up with a perspective for the middle classes that will be a historic failure.”Referring to the weakness of the west Macron admitted he was impatient, if not frustrated, to hear a German response to his call for a strategic dialogue on a more integrated Europe. Asking for a clear answer, he said: “We have a history of waiting for answers” from each other.“What’s key in the coming years is to move much faster on issues of sovereignty on the European level.”He developed his controversial call for Europe to open a strategic dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the only way to end frozen conflicts including in Ukraine is for Europe to work with Russia. He insisted: “My position is not pro-Russian or anti-Russian, it is pro-European.”In a reference to the US and the UK, he said: “I hear the defiance of all our partners I’m not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak … is not a policy, it’s a completely inefficient system.“There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren’t able to resolve them.”Although he said the current policy of sanctions and counter-sanctions was not working, he did not advocate they be lifted in the context of Ukraine.He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in European democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend its networks adding: “I do believe in miracles, but in policies.”Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections – he denied it was a veto - to the accession of Northern Macedonia so long as the EU agreed the accession process became less theological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The EU in its current review of its accession procedures also had to end the concept that progress to accession was not reversible, he said.Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron’s offer of dialogue.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.” He called for the “construction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato”.Europe needed to respond due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which Europe had closed it eyes.He explained: “The real game-changer is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.”Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and Sahel, Europe “should not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace”, he added.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world.“We are witnessing today is an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,” Steinmeier said, adding: “Every year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation.“Under its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.”Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending.“Only a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Properties in Ballaghaderreen, Charlestown and Clogherevagh raided as part of operationCandidates will have to pay \u0026euro150 per poster under Irish littering lawsForecaster says flood risk increased as ground saturated after recent downpoursPair suspected of using devices to skim data, record pin numbers and withdraw cashAbuse alleged to have happened in man\u0026rsquos home, in scout hall and scout campMen say abuse happened in man\u0026rsquos home, in scout hall and scout camp\u0026lsquoWe watch these houses being built, and none of our children on the list are getting them\u0026rsquoOireachtas staff supplied with handy mugshots of new TDs as parties descendHSE has avoided publicly stating providers should cut or close services to stay in budgetLast semi-final held in cadets\u0026rsquo mess at the Curragh CampBrandon Lewis insists: \u0026lsquoWe will not be having a border down the Irish Sea\u0026rsquoSinn F\u0026eacutein leader says voters angry that Fianna F\u0026aacuteil is not sitting down for discussionsBroadcaster relieved at return of family home, and plans to step back from mediaPathologists cannot establish cause of death, making case much harder to solve\u0026lsquoSpad\u0026rsquo list announced in connection with New Decade, New Approach dealDecorated past player announces he will be candidate for University of Dublin panelGarda\u0026iacute had set up listening devices at Dublin house"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4174179.1581701644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ivan yates i was a poster boy for bankruptcy tourism","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIvan Yates: ‘This allows us to get on with the final phase of our life, and I intend to step back from media work.’ Photograph: Cyril ByrneBroadcaster and former Fine Gael minister Ivan Yates is planning to retire this summer and live a quieter life on the family farm following the settlement of a legal dispute with AIB over ownership of his Wexford property.He says he is unable to put into words the intensity of the battle he has had to wage over the past decade to prevent the loss of the property to the bank, and to do so while all the time being so in the public eye.“I’ve turned 60 now and I’ve been in the public eye since I was elected to the Dáil in ’81,” he says.“I was a councillor in 1979, so between politics, business and the media, I have given it a fair stint.”He was just 21 when first elected to the Dáil. He served as minister for agriculture, food and forestry in the 1994-1997 rainbow coalition led by John Bruton. After leaving politics, Yates went into business, saw that business collapse and, after going through bankruptcy in Wales, developed a new career in broadcasting.His wife, Deirdre, is finishing her career as a primary school teacher in July, and now that the couple have settled a massive High Court dispute over their home in Blackstoops, Enniscorthy, Yates is in a position to wind down his broadcasting career.He presents Newstalk’s drivetime programme, The Hard Shoulder, and presents with Matt Cooper The Tonight Show on Virgin Media One. Yates lives in Dublin during the week because of his broadcasting commitments.“There is no way that if Deirdre lives in Enniscorthy that I’d be living in Dublin, so this is a real moment, one of the happiest things that has happened in my life.”Yates left politics in 2001 and became involved in the rapid expansion of Celtic Bookmakers, a chain of betting shops. However, the business went into receivership in 2011, and AIB pursued him for debts of €3.6 million.He went to live in Wales and availed of the bankruptcy laws there, which were much less harsh than the regime that existed in Ireland at the time. He described the trauma of seeing his world collapse around him in his autobiography, Full On (2014).“When I went to Wales in 2012, it was a 12-year life sentence to go bankrupt in Ireland under its draconian, Victorian laws.“And when I came back in 2013, I wasted no opportunity to excoriate governments, politicians and the system to adopt the UK Insolvency Act 1986 that gave people a fresh start, allowed everyone to get on with the rest of their lives, and allowed closure for the financial institutions.”However, he is pleased the law here has been changed so it now reflects the UK regime, something that has “completely transformed” the situation of tens of thousands of people, he says.At the time of his move to Wales, it was not clear whether it would lead to the loss of the Blackstoops property, and even now he cannot say definitively whether, with hindsight, the move was a good one. “That’s a complex question.”Yates and his wife had signed personal guarantees for Celtic Bookmakers’ borrowings. In 2016 the bank was awarded a €1.6 million judgment order against Deirdre.The bankruptcy trustees appointed by the Welsh courts got possession over the Yates family home and 150-acre farm in Blackstoops, but could not evict Yates because his mother, who is now 88, had the right to continue living on the property.“I mean we were literally homeless, in that we didn’t own our own home,” Yates says. “Because of my mother’s life interest, we have always remained there, and it has been our family home, but the situation was that my bankruptcy did imperil the home.”In 2017 Ivan and Deirdre took a complex High Court action against AIB and the bankruptcy trustees, challenging their taking possession of the Enniscorthy property on a number of grounds.The case was to go ahead on February 4th, and was expected to last two weeks. But court records show it was settled on January 31st. Yates says he cannot discuss the settlement.“There is a confidentiality clause. There will be no further litigation. The matter has been resolved,” is all he will say when questioned on the detail. But the key point for him is that he will continue to live at Blackstoops.Ivan and Deirdre have four children, aged 25-31, and a grandchild who lives in Co Wexford.Massive reliefSettling the case “is a massive relief to my mother, my extended family and my own four children. I really want to thank my legal team, Ensor O’Connor Solicitors, a small family practice in Wexford, and my senior counsel, Jerry Healy, and Peter Bland SC and Paula McCarthy BL.”“This allows us to get on with the final phase of our life, and I intend to step back from media work.” His broadcasting contracts run up to August, and he plans to step back then, though he has not yet decided on the full details.The aggressive approach adopted by Yates on the party leaders’ debate on Virgin Media One during the general election campaign provoked a lot of comment and no small amount of criticism.He began the debate by accusing the seven party leaders in front of him as being a “bunch of charlatans and chancers”. But he does not regret his approach.“I honestly believe that the 1977 general election promises caused a decade of recession, and the 2007 election directly contributed to the crash.”He dislikes what he describes as the “Dutch auction” aspect of the election campaign just finished, and feels the media did not properly hold the parties to account over the promises they were making. “And the public lapped up the promises.

I actually don’t mind a few brickbats and I don’t mind social media flak, that never bothers me.”The politicians “were putting their own popularity and short-term party interests above the national interest, and I sort of knew that the Department of Finance were absolutely doing their nut about this, and couldn’t say anything.”His plan for retirement is to “take life a bit easier”.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe third of Ireland’s post-crash elections threw up the third shock result last weekend, demonstrating that unpredictability and volatility are the new normal in Irish politics. Flustered and flummoxed by the results, politicians – winners and losers – scrambled all week to absorb and adjust to the new reality. So did everyone else.It wasn’t just the hardened politicians in the old firm parties of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that were struggling to come to terms with the results. Many Sinn Féin TDs, gathering in their droves at Leinster House on Thursday, had the honesty to look a bit shell-shocked by the whole thing.But it is Sinn Féin that made the big headlines and represents the big change in this election. The party’s post-ceasefire growth – boosted by the financial crash – in polls and in seats had abated in recent years. Indeed, last year’s elections suggested that the party hadn’t just plateaued so much as gone into sharp decline.This wasn’t a construction – as some party boosters have it now – of a hostile, pro-establishment media. It was feared and believed by Sinn Féin itself, as demonstrated by the fact it was still trimming its election tickets only days before the election was called. The surge the party now delights in was every bit as much a surprise to the party as it was to anyone else.This week Mary Lou McDonald skilfully sought to capitalise on her success, embarking on a series of hastily arranged meetings with the other parties, designed as much to place Sinn Féin at the centre of the government formation narrative as anything else. Everyone knows the serious talking hasn’t started yet, and won’t for some time. But Sinn Féin was front and centre there was no denying that.The stated position of McDonald and her party was to put together a coalition of the left, led by Sinn Féin, and excluding both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. But despite the allure of that prospect for many, it was always a long shot maybe an impossible one. The numbers dictated that.The difficulties in this process were illustrated when the Green Party’s meeting with the People Before Profit-Solidarity group turned out to be a meeting only with the three TDs in the People Before Profit element of the alliance. Solidarity, with its one TD, Mick Barry, would hold a separate meeting with Rise (also one TD, Paul Murphy).Scattered IndependentsAnd that was before you got to the Independents, 14 of whom would be needed to constitute the bare minimum required to elect a taoiseach and form a government.Good luck with forging a consensus in a group that included rural Independents such as Noel Grealish and Denis Naughten TDs such as the former Labour deputy Michael McNamara singular figures such as Michael Lowry and Verona Murphy and very left-leaning TDs such as Thomas Pringle and Joan Collins – and all points in between.On the rightleft spectrum of Irish politics – not always the best description, admittedly – the group of Independents contains people at either end.They would also all have their own local demands that is a fact of politics. Cork South-West Independent Michael Collins gave an indication of the sort of bargaining that would be required. He was willing – more than willing – to talk to anyone about government.He would require (a) a ministry of fisheries, (b) a rural resettlement programme and (c) no downgrading of Bantry hospital.Diversity is no doubt a wonderful thing. But it doesn’t make putting a government together any easier.But the numbers were the real problem they just weren’t there for Sinn Féin. Any hopes that an unlikely coalition could be scaffolded together began to evaporate when the outgoing Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin made clear on Wednesday that the new parliamentary party had agreed, on his recommendation, that they would not be prepared to serve in a new government.This aspect of the announcement was overshadowed by Howlin’s resignation after a difficult four years as leader of the party, a job he took only after being more or less press-ganged into the role by his colleagues in 2016.Howlin was probably one of the best ministers in the 2011-2016 government, but his party continues to pay a heavy price for its role in that turbulent administration. In 2020 terms that price was: only six TDs, and no part in government. Labour struggles on.But if lots of people missed the significance of Labour crushing the hopes of a left-led government, the people who were counting heads did not.The old firmOn Friday morning Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, acknowledged what anyone who could count had known for some time: the involvement of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael would be needed to form a government. Needless to say, he was excoriated by Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit for “throwing in the towel”. Boyd Barrett will never throw in the towel on the revolution.Once the results of the election were settled and finalised – if not quite digested or understood – there were two significant developments this week that have had an impact on the possibility of forming a government.The first was the realisation that the left-led government wouldn’t have the numbers. The second was Fianna Fáil’s decision to stick with Micheál Martin’s refusal to engage with Sinn Féin. There was a fair bit of grumbling about Martin among his TDs and the wider organisation in the aftermath of the result everyone expected to do better, and many hoped the party would do a lot better. But there are no widespread objections to his stance on Sinn Féin.That doesn’t mean that the party will rush headlong into the embrace of Fine Gael but it does mean Martin is on secure ground when he rules out being Sinn Féin’s partners in government.Sinn Féin realised immediately that Martin’s stance meant the party’s most realistic route to government was closed off quickly McDonald accused the “old boys’ club” of a “sense of entitlement”.Perhaps that is true if so, she saw no irony in seeking to join it in government. But no matter. A new narrative was set: Sinn Féin was being excluded by the establishment, its mandate ignored, its voters disrespected. It is not an unfamiliar narrative to the party, nor one that has proved unprofitable for it.Second electionAlready the drum beats for another election began. “If we have to fight another election, okay, let’s have the election,” McDonald said. If there’s one thing that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are likely to agree on, it is that they should avoid that eventuality.The settling of the dust also makes clear that the Green Party and the Social Democrats are in powerful, perhaps pivotal, positions, whether they realise it or not. Even if Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cross the Rubicon to govern together, the numbers dictate that they will need additional votes in the Dáil to make a government possible.One of the two (the Greens or Soc Dems) would be necessary two preferable. Both made it clear this week that they would not be cheap dates. Once the talks are under way in a substantial way, that will become clearer – and uncomfortable for the old firm parties. Everyone focuses on Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but they will need others, too. It makes their job of agreeing and selling a new programme for government fiendishly difficult, and likely to take a long time. But if Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil want to be in government, and avoid an election, that is what the numbers require.Sooner or later, everyone has to play the numbers game.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of “arrogance” after he again ruled out entering a coalition government with her party. In her first speech in Northern Ireland since last weekend’s general election, Ms McDonald told Sinn Féin’s Six County AGM that “the people voted for change”.The election saw Sinn Féin win the largest share of the vote (24.5 per cent) and its candidates secured 37 Dáil seats, one fewer than Fianna Fáil’s total. “Sinn Féin won the election,” Ms McDonald told supporters on Saturday at the Balmoral Hotel in Belfast. Ahead of the speech it was made clear by Sinn Féin’s press department there would be no opportunity for the media to ask questions at the event. Mr Martin and Ms McDonald spoke by telephone on Friday, and he congratulated the Sinn Féin leader on her electoral success before outlining the reasons why his party will not go into coalition with her party.He said Fianna Fáil had a mandate and it was its prerogative and duty to try to form a government. He argued no grouping in the Dáil could force another grouping to form a government when there were such incompatible views on economic policy and other issues.In her speech on Saturday, Ms McDonald said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were “determined to keep us out of government” and that Mr Martin planned to “deny the people what they voted for”.“That is an arrogant and untenable position, given the strength of Sinn Féin’s mandate,” she said. Matt Carthy, the former MEP who topped the poll in Cavan-Monaghan in last week’s election, opened proceedings by attributing the party’s recent success to Ms McDonald.He said Sinn Féin “is in government in the North” and is ready to do likewise in the State. Standing in front of a banner stating ‘Time for Unity’, Ms McDonald said: “Never again will a general election be pitched as a simple choice between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“Just as the unionist majority here in the North has gone, the two-party system has been consigned to history”.All-Ireland partyMs McDonald said her candidates had been elected in record numbers on a “people’s manifesto” and noted all 32 counties on the island of Ireland now had a Sinn Féin representative. She claimed Sinn Féin is “the only all-Ireland party resolutely committed to Irish unity”.She attacked the republican credentials of Fianna Fáil, which does not stand for election in Northern Ireland but does have a loose relationship with the SDLP, which only stands for election in the North. “Fine Gael postures as the ‘United Ireland party’ but has no strategy, no programme and no real desire to bring unity about,” she said. “And as for Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, Irish unity doesn’t rate a mention in its manifesto’s five core aims.”She accused both of having “no plan, just waffle”.“They cannot block the growing demand around unity,” she added. Ms McDonald also criticised “so-called dissidents” for making threats against Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman, Gerry Kelly MLA , for attending a PSNI recruitment event in Belfast. She said those engaged in such threats had “no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer”.“They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people,” she said.StormontThe section of the speech on the restoration of Stormont gained applause from the audience.Ms McDonald highlighted the need for action on matters in Northern Ireland such as poverty, health, housing and victims’ issues, and stressed “unionists have nothing to fear from Irish unity”.“Of course many of them may see that differently,” she added. “But the answer to that is to talk.”Ms McDonald urged Sinn Féin activists to “keep your shoulder to the wheel” and serve local communities. She ended the speech by saying: “Onwards. Upwards. We can do this. We will do this. We are almost there. And now we will leave and work hard in our communities as proud republicans, as unapologetic united Irelanders.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

As a UK government, we will not be having a border down the Irish Sea.”Mr Lewis was appointed secretary of state on Thursday after the previous incumbent, Julian Smith, was sacked by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson.He told reporters he was “very fortunate to be coming in as secretary of state off the back of somebody who did a great job and actually delivered, as I say, that agreement”.Mr Smith, he said, had been “a superb secretary of state. I’ve got tough boots to fill and the exciting job of delivering on that agreement.”Mr Lewis visited Queen’s University’s Centre for Security Information Technologies (CSIT) in the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast on Friday afternoon, in what was his first trip to the North in his new role.During his first day in office he also spoke by telephone to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, as well as the North’s first and deputy first ministers, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill, as well as to the Chief Constable Simon Byrne.‘Vexatious prosecutions’Mr Coveney said on social media he and Mr Lewis had had “a very positive first call” and he was “looking forward” to working with him “for as long I hold my role in government”.Ms O’Neill said following her conversation with Mr Lewis they agreed to meet “as a matter of urgency” to discuss “important matters including his government’s approach to the legacy of the conflict, particularly in relation to the bad faith shown over the issue of pensions for those injured as a result of the conflict”.Mr Johnson has pledged to end what he describes as “vexatious prosecutions” against former servicemen.Ms O’Neill also said she intended to challenge Mr Lewis on the financial commitments made by the British government in the New Decade, New Approach deal and on Brexit.Meanwhile, Ms Foster told the BBC that Mr Lewis “has to be an advocate for the union and I very much hope that he is”.Regulatory checksMr Lewis is a former chairman of the Conservative Party and has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.Both he and Mr Johnson have previously said there will be no customs or regulatory checks on the Irish Sea as a result of Brexit.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said during a recent speech in Belfast that there would be regulatory checks at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports for goods arriving from Great Britain.Asked to clarify this, Mr Lewis replied: “We’ve always said the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to be one area and all will be able to benefit from our future global trade deals.“I appreciate what Michel Barnier says, he’s a very good man trying to do a good job for the EU, but this is also the man who said we couldn’t open the withdrawal agreement. And our prime minister got that agreement opened, got a new agreement, got it through parliament and we’ve left the European Union and we’re going to build a future beneficial economy for the whole of the United Kingdom as one,” he said.

I\u0027m very disillusioned with the UK but I have been for a while, he said.He expressed his frustration that United States passengers would be evacuated from the ship, which has been moored off the coast of Japan since February 5. Mrs Abel added No-one is talking to us ...We want someone to communicate with us, to tell us what\u0027s going to happen to us. At the moment we just don\u0027t know... I feel we have been completely overlooked.Mrs Abel added that the ambassador had just repeated what the ship\u0027s captain had already told them and had not given them any new information about what would happen to them. The World Health Organization has published advice on how to cope during the coronavirus outbreak. Our Asia correspondent Nicola Smith reports on the dilemma facing China\u0027s less powerful neighbours. She writes:As cases of the Covid-19 virus creep steadily higher beyond the borders of mainland China, Asian capitals are being forced to make the tricky calculation between protecting public health and mitigating the possible long-term economic consequences of any perceived slight to Beijing. China’s angry accusation at the US in early February of contributing to public hysteria and setting a “bad example” after Washington imposed restrictions on Chinese travellers and pulled some embassy staff out, no doubt rattled nerves in some Asian countries who rely heavily on Chinese trade and investment.A GP surgery in Portsmouth has become the latest to shut for deep cleaning after a coronavirus scare.The Kingston Crescent Surgery was closed on Friday until further notice after a woman suspected to have the virus walked into the surgery after falling ill.The woman is said to have felt unwell some time after arriving in Britain at Gatwick Airport.Local reports said she “ticked all the boxes” for a potential case of coronavirus.The closure is the latest to hit a string of surgeries and health centres around the country, including Islington in north London and Taunton in Somerset, after being attended by patients with suspected Coronavirus.David and Sally Abel, the British couple who have become famous for live streaming their quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, have begged the UK government to come to their rescue.In a live Facebook video Mr Abel, from Oxfordshire, said the UK government was not doing anything concrete.It\u0027s not just us, we\u0027re asking for all the Brits on board, he said. He urged followers to get onto the UK Foreign Office.The couple made the call after the United States government announced it would evacuate its passengers from the ship which has been quarantined off the Japanese coast since February 5.A further 67 people on board the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, Japan\u0027s health minister said on Saturday.The new cases, from 217 tests, bring the number of people diagnosed on the Diamond Princess to 285, excluding a quarantine officer who also contracted the illness.Our Paris correspondent David Chazan has more on the Chinese tourist who died from the coronavirus in France.The man was from Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. He was admitted to hospital in Paris on January 25 where he was kept in strict isolation. He was listed as critical soon after admission and his condition worsened in recent days.He was reportedly diagnosed late. He flagged himself up to doctors soon after arriving in France on January 16, but initially they failed to recognise his symptoms as the Covid-19 coronavirus.His death was announced by Agnès Buzyn, the French health minister. She added that there was “no cause for concern” about the condition of the other six coronavirus patients in French hospitals, including five Britons. All are expected to make a full recovery, according to medical sources.Another four coronavirus patients have been discharged from French hospitals with a clean bill of health, Ms Buzyn said.The minister is to hold a meeting with health professionals on Tuesday to discuss how to stem the spread of the virus. “We must prepare our health system to cope with a possible pandemic and the circulation of the virus in our country,” she said.The five Britons, diagnosed at a ski resort in the French Alps last weekend, caught the disease from a Briton who contracted it in Singapore.Another 67 people on board a cruise ship quarantined off Japan\u0027s coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the country\u0027s health minister said on Saturday.The new cases, from 217 tests, bring the number of people diagnosed on the Diamond Princess to 285, excluding a quarantine officer who also contracted the illness.The United States is to evacuate its citizens from the ship but the UK government has not said whether it will do the same for the 78 Britons on board. The daughter of the Chinese tourist who died from the coronavirus in France has also been hospitalised with the disease, the French health minister Agnes Buzyn has confirmed. The dead man’s daughter is at the Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, where her father was also being treated.But Ms Buzyn said: “Her state of health is no longer a cause for concern and she should be able to be released soon.”The man had arrived in France on January 16 from Hubei – the province of China most affected by the outbreak of coronavirus, officially known as Covid-19.“His condition had deteriorated rapidly and he had been in critical condition for several days, before being taken into intensive care, said Ms Buzyn.Daniel Zhang, chief executive of AlibabaChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has warned that the coronavirus could hit the company’s operations in the coming months despite a surge in revenue in the final quarter of 2019, writes Hasan Chowdhury.Daniel Zhang, chief executive of the online retail empire, said on Thursday that the coronavirus will “present near-term challenges to the development of Alibaba’s businesses across the board” as the outbreak makes a “significant impact on China’s economy”. Mr Zhang claimed that the company was using its “ecosystem’s powerful forces of commerce and technology” to combat coronavirus, while Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of Alibaba, has promised to donate $14.5m to “support the development of a coronavirus vaccine”. A Chinese tourist visiting France has become the first person to die of coronavirus in Europe. The French Ministry of Health announced the death on Saturday morning, as anxiety over the rising number of cases continued to grow.A Chinese politician has given a bullish assessment of the impact of the coronavirus on the country\u0027s economy.Qin Gang, vice minister of foreign affairs, said the economy would spring back when the outbreak was over.The impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy will be short term and temporary, he said at the Munich Security Conference.When the epidemic is over, the subdued consumer demand will be released rapidly and the economy will rebound strongly.Another 67 people on board a cruise ship quarantined off Japan\u0027s coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the country\u0027s health minister said on Saturday.The new cases, from 217 tests, bring the number of people diagnosed on the Diamond Princess to 285, excluding a quarantine officer who also contracted the illness.The United States is to evacuate its citizens from the ship but the UK government has not said whether it will do the same for the 78 Britons on board. Hundreds of anti-government protesters marched in multiple Hong Kong neighbourhoods on Saturday against government plans to potentially turn some buildings into coronavirus quarantine centres, demanding full closure of the mainland China border.The protests - which escalated in June over a perceived tightening of Beijing\u0027s grip over the city, which Beijing denies - have lost their intensity in recent weeks as panic over the virus kept most people indoors.But anger has been brewing over Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u0027s refusal to completely shut the border with mainland China, where coronavirus is believed to have originated, with some medical staff going on strike and small-scale protests emerging in various locations in support.On Saturday, hundreds rallied in the northern neighbourhoods of Tai Po and Tin Shui Wai as well as in Aberdeen on the Hong Kong island, chanting Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times and Oppose pneumonia clinic. Most protesters wore surgical masks and many were dressed in all black.Television footage showed police in riot gear making several arrests and using pepper spray in Tin Shui Wai.It is thought that banknotes can spread the diseaseChina is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, officials said on Saturday.Banks use ultraviolet light or high temperatures to disinfect yuan bills, then seal and store the cash for seven to 14 days - depending on the severity of the outbreak in a particular region - before recirculating them, China\u0027s central bank said at a press conference.The virus has sparked a rush to disinfect public places and minimise contact between people.Thailand has reported 34 cases so farThailand has recorded one new case of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 34 since January, a health ministry official said on Saturday.The new case is a 35-year-old Thai woman, a medical personnel, who got the disease from contact with a patient, Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoenchia, the director-general of the Department of Disease Control, told a news conference. Fourteen people have recovered and returned home.There are fears that the Olympic Games may have to be postponedJapanese practised the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay on Saturday on the outskirts of the capital. But the rehearsal comes amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak could postpone or impact the staging the Games. Japan, among the worst affected countries outside China, where the virus is believed to have originated, reported its first death from the virus on Friday.The handover in Hamura City formed part of a dress rehearsal for Tokyo 2020 organisers, who mimicked three legs of the relay that will last for 121 days in the build up to the Olympics that begin on July 24.However, organisers have said cancellation or postponement were not being considered and that the Olympics would go ahead as planned.The island of Oahu is popular with surfersHawaii authorities began a search on Friday for anyone who may have had close contact with a Japanese tourist who fell ill on the island of Oahu and tested positive for a new coronavirus soon after returning to his home country.Governor David Ige said the man in question is believed to have become infected in Japan before embarking on his trip, or while en route to Hawaii.The man had exhibited no sign of illness until reaching Oahu, where he first developed cold-like respiratory symptoms but no fever, the state\u0027s health director, Dr Bruce Anderson, told reporters.There are fears that the virus may spread further as migrants return to work after a the Lunar New Year holidayChinese citizens returning to Beijing will have to isolate themselves either at home or in a concentrated area for medical observation, the capital\u0027s government said on Friday.The notice warns there will be legal consequences for those who don\u0027t comply with the 14-day quarantine. It did not elaborate on how the isolation will be enforced. While Beijing returnees were previously ordered to self-quarantine for two weeks, that measure allowed for occasional outings and implementation varied across neighborhoods.Chinese officials have warned that the coronavirus may spread further as migrants return to their jobs in cities or other provinces after a prolonged Lunar New Year holiday.China has announced a significant drop in new coronavirus cases to 2,641, but total deaths still rose yesterday by 143 to 1,523.The number of new cases has fallen by about half on the previous day when Beijing had reported 5,090 people contracting the virus.China has been hit hard by the outbreak with a huge impact on retail and servicesChina will maintain its prudent monetary policy, a central bank official said on Saturday, as the nation\u0027s economy is hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak.Fan Yifei, vice governor at the People\u0027s Bank of China, told a press briefing that consumer prices were unlikely to rise sharply.He added that non-performing loan ratio remained relatively low in China and he saw space to deal with bad loan problems. There are growing fears that the virus could push China into a secret recession.Pandemics and epidemicsStorm Dennis: Navy and RNLI search to save man overboard from vessel off Kent amid flood warnings - live updatesBuyers\u0026#39 remorse in Ireland for Sinn Fein votersLesotho gripped by murder of first ladyBritain should send more spies and military hardware to Kurdistan, regional Prime Minister saysComment: The Tories need to hurry up and get their heads around what Red Wall voters really wantAntigone, Interrupted, Scottish Dance Theatre review: a little less conversation, a little more Antigone, pleaseHebden Bridge flood victims brace themselves for Storm DennisComment: Angela Merkel\u0026#39s troubled party is ripe for disruptionPolice record 120,000 \u0026#39non-crime\u0026#39 hate incidents that may stop accused getting jobsComment: Venezuela cannot defeat Maduro on its ownUS raises tariffs on Airbus to 15pc as Donald Trump stirs trade war with EU Prince Andrew alleged to have stayed with tycoon Peter Nygard who has been accused of rapesCoronavirus: Heathrow scare as passenger falls ill on flight from San FranciscoFake online prostitutes urge men to make their excuses and leaveChildren as young as six are suspects in \u0026#39sexting\u0026#39 offencesCoronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Next Labour leader: who are the remaining candidates vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn?Harry Dunn: Car \u0026#39seen on wrong side of road outside RAF base near where teenager died\u0026#39Emily Thornberry knocked out of Labour leadership contestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/14/12/BP-oil-rig.jpg","title":"climate change greenwashing bp net zero 2050 advertising","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BP’s aim of achieving net zero emissions has rightly been criticised for lacking substance, but its commitment to stop misleading adverts about its impact on the climate is a welcome start – it must be held to account on this, writes Ben ChapmanBuried a couple of thousand words beneath BP’s eye-catching announcement that it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was an important promise that garnered much less attention.The oil company said it would stop funding “corporate reputation advertising” which, in the context of the oil and gas industry, is more commonly known as greenwash.This means BP will end its multimillion-pound “Possibilities Everywhere” campaign, which touted the company’s questionable green credentials. That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is a way you can achieve positive changeInvesting in trackers means you have to take the rough with the smooth, hitching your wagon to oil companies and natural resource outfits if they\u0027re in the index you\u0027re tracking. The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition. I highlighted two separate studies that found European money managers do a lot better than their US peers when it comes to voting in favour of progressive resolutions.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

Plastic rubbish will outweigh fish in the oceans by 2050 unless the world takes drastic action to recycle the material, a report warned in 2016.Garbage on East Beach, Henderson Island (Pitcairn Islands), in the south Pacific Ocean. The uninhabited island has been found to have the world\u0027s highest density of waste plastic, with more than 3,500 additional pieces of litter washing ashore daily at just one of its beaches. This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will be given the option of looking at their normal feed or clicking through to the latest posts, which will show in chronological order.Instagram changed the order of the feed in early 2016, almost exactly four years ago, but many of the app\u0027s users still regularly ask for it to come back.Instagram update tells users who they don’t likeIn the time since, the company has had to fight against claims that it leads to almost all posts being missed, and has made some concessions to users by changing the way the algorithm chooses which posts are chosen to be shown.Despite all of that, the company has repeatedly insisted that the chronological feed will not be returning. The new update appears to be some concession for the demands for posts to appear in time order, without entirely reversing the switch to using an algorithm.Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment and further information on the potential feature.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

This black hole resides about 54 million light-years from EarthPluto, as pictured by Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spacecraft as it flew over the dwarf planet for the first time ever in July 2015A coronal mass ejection as seen by the Chandra Observatory in 2019. This is the first time that Chandra has detected this phenomenon from a star other than the SunDark, narrow, 100 meter-long streaks running downhill on the surface Mars were believed to be evidence of contemporary flowing water. It has since been suggested that they may instead be formed by flowing sand NasaJPLUniversity of ArizonaMorning Aurora: Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station in October 2015Grundy said in an email that to the human eye, Arrokoth would look less red and more dark brown, sort of like molasses. The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS. It was designed for a global group of brands, which we no longer are.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Long after I’ve been buried. The thrill of seeing Nuneaton go by in a blur will remain only a dream for me.Yes, HS is going ahead.A rail service that was designed to ­benefit the north of England. But will probably benefit Londoners primarily. Same ol’ same ol’ then. I’ve always had mixed feelings about HS. I don’t really care that it’s horribly over budget.Everything we do is ALWAYS horribly over budget. And takes twice as long as we were told it would take. If this were China or Russia, the thing would have been finished last week. .But I do care that this line is ripping up more of England’s green and pleasant land. We have been rapidly paving over our country in the past  years.It is true, mind, that once a big rail line is built and people get to travel on it, many of the complaints dissolve. As the Government says, this was true of the HS line, which faced enormous opposition at the outset. Now everyone seems to be agreed that it’s a brilliant thing.Sure. But HS was dferent. There were parts of Kent where it took almost two hours to reach central London by train. That’s been cut massively — to  minutes from Ashford International.That’s a real change for the better.The problem with HS is that it doesn’t sort out the problems that need sorting out. And those are the problems in the north of our country.Leeds and Manchester, for example, are only -odd miles apart. And yet the train service between these two great northern cities is woeful.The North East is stuck out on a limb, with truly rotten local services and long journey times between cities.Take my neck of the woods, Teesside — a vast area of , people. Two hours almost to travel the  miles to Leeds. More than an hour — sometimes one hour  minutes — to reach Newcastle,  miles away.No wonder people use their cars, instead. And the first stage of HS won’t come near to sorting that out.The people in the North who dutully marched over to vote for the Tories last December know that HS is not really for them.They need new lines and new infrastructure to link up the big cities and the new hi-tech industrial hubs — Merseyside, Manchester, Leeds, Teesside and Tyneside. That will take considerable investment.The money spent on HS could have more usefully been erted to new, speedy, rail links between our northern cities.Don’t think that we, up here, don’t know. We’re not stupid. We voted Conservative for a whole bunch of reasons — but those votes were only loaned. They are not for the Tories in perpetuity.Unless we get that kind of investment, Boris, you might find that Red Wall being built again.IT seems that Chinese people in London are getting sick of being abused on account of the coronavirus.People shouting at them stuff like: “We’d all be OKyou lot didn’t eat dead bats!” And so on.The same thing is happening in Paris. One poor Asian bloke was walking around with a placard that read: “I am NOT a virus.”I think we need to reach out with a bit of affection. If you see a Chinese bloke on the Tube give him a big hug. Unless he’s coughing a lot.THE Prime Minister’s chief adviser, the excellent Dominic Cummings, has suggested that the cabinet be replaced by the kids’ cartoon characters, PJ Masks.For once, he is wrong. I can see the attraction, obviously. But I thinkyou wanted a really dynamic cabinet, Wonder Pets! are the way to go.And Ming-Ming Duckling should be Chancellor of the Exchequer.PRINCE Harry,he’s still a Prince, was flown by private jet to give a speech to one of the richest companies in the world, JP Morgan.He won’t tell ushe was paid for it or not. He’s now supposedly on the verge of a deal with investment bank Goldman Sachs. They made plenty of money out of the banking crisis in , which saw ordinary people properly stuffed.He talks like a leftie and acts like the most venal, money-grabbing capitalist. And all the while being ferried to and from in the most environmentally unfriendly manner possible.Anyway,you’ve got time to spare, watch a -second video clip of US comic Kyle Dunnigan pretending to be Meghan Markle. It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen for years.APPARENTLY we human beings spend , hours of our miserably short lives regretting stuff we’ve done in the past. And mulling it over.That’s almost a year spent tearing your hair out. About whether it was right to have done your we’s sister when the missus was away on a work trip.And I bet it’s only people guilty of little misdemeanours who fret the most.I can’t know for sure, but I would guess that Hitler didn’t spend , hours thinking: “Hmmm. I wonderit was right to have invaded Poland ”I suppose we eat ourselves up with worry because it might stop us doing the same thing again. But it doesn’t, does it SO the we tells me in no uncertain terms to buy no presents for Valentine’s Day. Fair enough, I think. whole thing’s a con.Then, two days ago, she askedI’ve ordered her Valentine’s Day flowers yet.I’m like, “Whaaaa ” It transpires that flowers are not “presents”.Dunno what other gt she was expecting. Better get a card, too, I suppose.The ones that sell best are those with really filthy messages. So I’ve decided to make my own.The verse will read: “Roses are redAnd Margate’s in ThanetI’ve got a todgerThe size of a planet.”Hope she likes it.I’M really enjoying Dominic Sandbrook’s history of the s on BBC.I can’t say I liked the decade much at the time. The music was crap, for a start, and so were the hairstyles.

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIt’s time to batten down the hatches as Storm Dennis gears up to unleash gale-force chaos. Up until last December,I’d written that sentence it would have meant something far more exceptional than freak weather. It would have referenced the Beast of Bolsover savaging Tories in the Commons for their latest cruel, or shambolic, act. But Dennis Skinner sadly lost his seat at the general election, meaning he won’t make it to his th anniversary as an MP, which was due in June, and we’ll never see such wit, honesty and dedication in a single parliamentarian again. He’ll hate me for mentioning this as he sees no point in marking birthdays, but he was  this week.I’m confident you’ll join me in wishing him all the best because in the  years I’ve been writing this column I’ve had more letters from readers expressing their love and admiration for Dennis than for any other person. Deservedly so. During his time there, the former coal miner was present in the Commons every day it sat, unless his hip replacement, heart bypass or bladder cancer got in the way.I’ve never met anyone so obsessed with turning up for work in parliament. I interviewed him there over the Christmas break in  when he was the only MP in the ­virtually empty building. He told me Westminster was to him what the pit is to a miner. Where your honest toil earns you a crust. It’s why he never had a drink in the bars because “men in factories can’t sup on the job”, or paired with a Tory MP because it was “organised absenteeism”. Yet so many politicians who put in a fraction of Skinner’s service believe it’s their ine right, on leaving the Commons, to be handed a seat in the Lords, where they can carry on sucking on the taxpayers’ teats while giving off a whf of power. There was never any chance Dennis would go there. He wouldn’t even enter it for the Queen’s Speech, often telling that fella in the frilly tights where to stick his Black Rod. Yet I would have loved itJeremy Corbyn, instead of ­recommending John Bercow and Tom Watson for peerages in his Dissolution Honours List, had put forward only Dennis Skinner. Knowing he would never have entertained it. He’s so straight he refused to hold a passport so he couldn’t be lobbied to take a foreign freebie and never took a cup of tea from a journalist in case it was perceived as bribery. So imagine him doing what these unelected cronies in the Lords have just done, handing themselves a .% pay rise, thus taking their daily, tax-free allowance to £.

thousands turn to advance payments - but they have to be paid back out of your own benefits. These figures show advance repayments cost £m in one month alone - with struggling northern English towns the worst hitShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  FEB News \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNearly £million of  Universal Credit benefit payments were clawed back from the poorest households in one month last year, according to the Tory government’s own figures. New claimants for Universal Credit have to wait a minimum of five weeks for their first payment to be processed, forcing many to take out loans form from the Government. The borrowing, known as Advance Payments, to cover their basic living costs before their first entitlement arrives and is then deducted from regular payments. The delay has faced harsh criticism with MPs warning that the need to borrow forces claimants into a cycle of debt with some ending up at food banks as a result.The Department for Work and Pensionsadmitted that in August , the latest period available, it deducted £ million from claimants across the UK to pay back their loans. The ten worst hit areas are in northern towns in what has been referred to as the Red Wall - traditional Labour seats in the North and Midlands many of which fell to the Tories for the first time in the December election.Knowsley was the worst hit with £, repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions during August closely followed by Hartlepool on £, and Bootle with £,.In Glasgow South West, the constituency of Chris Stephens MP who asked for the figures, £, was repaid for UC Advance Repayment deductions in one month. Stephens described the figures showing the money being clawed back from some of the most deprived areas of the country as “astonishing” It is clear from this answer that the DWP Advance Payment system simply doesn’t work and demonstrates that the UK Social Security system is broken.” Stephens said: “I would urge all Parliamentary colleagues to look at these figures and to press the UK Government to build a social security system fit for purpose, starting with ending the five week wait.”  “What is required is to end the five week wait, and introduce a first payment within the first two weeks of a claim without the need to pay this back – the current system is a vicious circle of debt.”  A DWP spokesperson said: “In August  alone £.bn in Universal Credit was paid out across the UK, and advance repayments amounted to less than  percent of that figure.” In full: The  UK areas worst-hit by Universal Credit advances KEY: Constituency and how much was repaid in Universal Credit advances in August  alone. Other deductions were taken for other reasons - such as overpayments, arrears, fines or fraud - but advance payment deductions made up £.million of the £.million in total deductions across the country. .

Floral tributes including a bottle of Jack Daniels and a Rolex watch have been left to remember Billy and Joe Smith found dead just days after Christmas. Billy and Joe, who appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding in , were found dead in a country lane in a suspected double suicide. A grieving woman held the glass of Billy’s carriage and kissed the window before saying “I love you” outside St John’s Church. There was an outpouring of tributes following their tragic deaths and their funeral is underway in Sevenoaks, Kent. As the service was about to start at .am, there was standing room only. A small boy in a grey suit was comforted by the side of Billy’s carriage where women gathered smoking cigarettes and pressing their hands against the carriage. The twins’ white coffins were carried into the church, one behind the other.The street emptied as the service begun, leaving a trio of white Mercedes limos parked outside. A heartbreaking poem, written by the twinsapos best friends, was read out at the service. To the boys from your closest friends, Words will never be able to convey The emptiness we feel today. Remember all the precious moments From near misses on camp fires When fishing through the night, To venue nights with your cousin, Angel, and Roxie Where we laughed so much we cried. That’s the way it was, just us five. And then there would be the outings to McD’s, Asking for a roast dinner, your face dead straight While the rest of us could barely keep a straight face. There has never been a time we felt sadness As your energy and light would light any room. Your love and laughter left footprints on our hearts When you left you took a piece of all of us with you. Till we meet again, rest in paradise, boys.  Some of the outstanding floral arrangements at the home of their doting gran Phoebe Smith include a bottle of Jack Daniels made entirely out of flowers, a Rolex watch and a poignant display of the word apossonsapos. Among the tributes are huge freestanding love hearts, and frames of the boys with their loved ones, including their beloved grandma, Phoebe Smith. Those looking at the flowers in Ms Smithaposs front garden are also hearing a selection of the twinsapos favourite songs on a speaker. Fittingly on Valentineaposs Day, dozens of Ferrero Rocher chocolates filled a heart of roses.  A picture of the twins, both , made up the letter aposOapos in the word aposSonsapos. One note on the Jack Danielaposs floral tribute said:To my pals Bill and Joe. Gone but never forgotten. Always in our thoughts. Another note on a similar Jose Cuervo Especial tequila bottle floral tribute read: To my Joe and Billy. Thank you for the best memories and never leaving me. Iaposll love you forever. One tribute said: To Kentaposs biggest two legends. I will miss you both very much. Until we meet again boys. Today hundreds of people lined the streets of Sevenoaks in Kent before the funeral service at .am. Local resident Georgina Taylor, who dropped her plans to pay her respects at the church, said she can identy as a twin herself. The -year-old, from nearby Seal, said: “I am a twin myself and I can really sympathise.  I would be devastatedI lost my sister, at the end of the day we love each other. “I really feel sorry for the poor mum, the small children who have lost their dad and the whole family. She added: “Romany gypsies are very proud people, they have a lot of history and I feel really sad for the whole family. “I can really identy with it and I can understand those twin boys couldn’t bear to be without each other. They must have been really close. “I was supposed to be somewhere  this morning, at my singing group, but I heard about the service and the procession and I had to come.” A reporter for Kent Live who is in Sevenoaks said: The majority of people are in pockets of small groups chatting away, catching up and introducing each other to those they haven’t met or seen in a while.  It’s pretty cold but some of the men have been passing around little bottles of JD, one of the twins’ favourite drinks, to warm the spirits and pay their respects. Starting at their grandmotheraposs house at about am, the route took mourners along High Street towards St John the Baptist Church - a journey of nearly two miles. The white carriages are adorned with flowers and pictures of the boys. Joey, who was born first, was in the first carriage while Billy followed behind in the second carriage. The carriage carrying Joey had the word Daddy spelt out in white flowers on its roof while Billy had Uncle on top of his.  Pictures of the twins were displayed on each side of the carriages, which were being driven by people dressed all in black, to show family and friends who was in each one. They were followed by three white Mercedes limos, thought to contain some of the boysapos closest family members. They were tragically found next to each other in a country lane on the morning of December   after a relative found a suicide note, a coroner was told.  The tree surgeons, who had celebrated their nd birthdays about two weeks earlier, were remembered on a Facebook memorial page as brothers who came into this world together and went into the next together. Paddy Doherty, one of the reality showaposs biggest names and winner of CelebrityBig Brother, said in a video tribute that the deaths of the two good-looking boys were a terrible tragedy. Other tributes on the memorial page said it was just heartbreaking two beautul young souls gone too soon and wished the pair would both rest in gods home in heaven in eternal peace.

But mum-of-two Meryn, from Chesham, Bucks, said Cara is defying the odds by not just walking and talking but modelling for catalogues and campaigns too. The social researcher said: The way the consultant broke the news to Duncan and I wasn’t good – he didn’t have a good bedside manner. “He told us Cara had Down’s syndrome and then listed all the medical issues she could possibly have, such as heart and bowel problems. None of which she does, luckily. “They present it as a really negative thing and just talk about a lot of medical issues.  “When you’re just presented with a long list of problems that your child is going to have, it’s very scary and a terrying thing to hear. “But Cara’s four-and-a-half now and I wish I could go back in time and tell myself that she would be fine and an amazing little girl. “It’s important that adverts and the media reflect society as it really is, and it’s fantastic Cara is contributing towards a more inclusive picture of society and counteracting negative stereotypes of Down’s syndrome. “She’s done so well and I’m so proud of her.”  Cara is now involved in a campaign, Downright Amazing, to educate midwives and doctors to break the news to parents their child has Down’s syndrome in a sensitive way. The idea to kick start her modelling career came from Meryn’s desire to battle the stereotype of the condition, showing children in a positive light. The precocious youngster had her first shoot at two when a local photographer asked for help building his portfolio and is now a natural in front of the camera.  Since then Cara has bagged an agent and picked up paid work for clothing range Little Green Radicals, as well as starring in Downright Amazingaposs campaigns. Sheaposs even become a celebrity in her local area and Meryn said her girl is recognised daily since she began modelling. Meryn said: “Cara loves seeing the photos of herself and she loves doing it because she just gets to play around in the garden having fun. She’s become really confident. “It’s been lovely to see how everything has come together. “She’ll see a picture of herself in the supermarket and she’ll point it out. She’s always smiling and waving at everyone.  “We were in an ice cream shop once and some children recognized her and it was really nice, she loved it.” The youngster’s condition means she is slower in reaching her milestones than her peers but she is now walking, talking and making friends at nursery as well as modelling for catalogues with her -month-old sister, Jessica, who doesnapost have the condition. But Meryn said she and lawyer husband, Duncan have received criticism for Cara’s slower development from people the family doesn’t even know.  She said: “We were in a car dealership a couple of years ago and a couple pointed at Cara and said she was way too old to be crawling. “They were quite embarrassed when I explained that she had Down’s syndrome.

For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.  nThe next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simply wasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.  nI raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ”  nA mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.”  nA few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  n  n   nSimon  nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold.  nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP.  nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”.  nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour.  nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it.  nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.”  nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help.  nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic.  nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.”  n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.”  nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.”  nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces.  n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ”  n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ”  n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ”  nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved.  n“Go on,” he said cautiously.  n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ”  nA rueful roll of the eyes.  n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.”  n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.”  n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie.  n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.”  nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.”  n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time.  n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness.  n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.”  nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying.  n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly.  n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.”  nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled.  n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.”  nWhen people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.  n  nTop news stories from n   n nAdele  nAdele has spent the last three months of her le in an urban specialist cancer centre.  nIn all that time, she has not felt fresh air.

When patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. But Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. In a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... Dorothy Dorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. “There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” “What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. She gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” I knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. “I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” Rarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. “Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  “Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” “How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” “Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” A good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. But infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. In a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. On Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. Desperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. Flushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.The next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simplywasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.I raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” A mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” A few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  Simon Simon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. The lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. The speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. I heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. Simon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. Beside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” Simon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. The nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. I saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” “Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” I broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” There are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. “Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” “I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” “One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” I saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. “Go on,” he said cautiously. “OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” A rueful roll of the eyes. “No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” “Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” “I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. “Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” Sophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” “I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. “You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. “It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” Simon and Sophie were quietly crying. “How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. “I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” Simon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. “OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” When people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWith three young children of her own, the Duchess of Cambridge clearly knows how sound early ­development plays a vital role in shaping a youngster’s future. And the -year-old royal has told of her determination to help others improve the lives of British kids by drawing on her experiences of growing up in a loving, caring family. In her biggest interview to date, Kate revealed how a granny devoted precious time to her, which she believes played a part in forging her personality. She spoke about her landmark national survey to examine the importance of children’s early years development, heralded as the largest and most important of its kind ever. One of her main goals is to build a support network that not only helps children but also new mums after learning that one of the main causes of death in young mothers is suicide. Kate told parental blogger Giovanna Fletcher on her Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcast: “It’s going to take a long time, I’m talking about a ­generational change, but ­hopefully this is the first small step… to start a ­conversation on the i­mportance of early childhood development. “It’s not just about happy, healthy children. This is for lelong consequences and outcomes.” Speaking about how she and Prince William are bringing up George, six, Charlotte, four, and -month-old Louis, Kate added: “If I take the ­experience from my own childhood, coupled with what I know now and what I’ve learnt from the experts in the early years sector, I think there’s a few things that really stand out for me. “One is quality of ­relationships. I had an amazing granny who devoted a lot of time to us, playing with us, doing arts and crafts and gardening, and I try to incorporate a lot of the experiences that she gave us into the experiences that I give my children now.  “There are also the environments you spend time in as well, a happy home, a safe environment. “As children, we spent a lot of time outside and it’s something I’m really passionate about. “I think it’s so great for physical and mental wellbeing and laying [developmental] foundations.” More than , people have completed Kate’s Five Big ­Questions on the Under-Fives survey. The Duchess said: “I thinkyou look at who’s caring and nurturing children in the most vital period to the age of five, parents and carers are right at the heart of that, and families are right at the heart of that. “Although I’ve spoken to scientists and the service providers, it’s so important to listen to families. What we’re doing with the survey is asking people what is it that matters for them in raising their children.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry snub","story":"w.mantis  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry snub invite to Prince Andrews th n Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not be at his uncles big birthday bash which is not very nice for the Queen who had wanted her close family around her, it is claimed n Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly snubbed an invite to Prince Andrewaposs birthday, it has been claimed  nHarry and Meghan will not be making the trip from Canada for his uncleaposs th birthday on February .  nNeil Sean, a UK-based royal correspondent who appears on US TV, told Fox News that itaposs not very nice for the Queen.  nHe said: A mole [told] me it’s an open secret they declined the invite but it’s not very nice for the Queen as, whatever people say and think, he is [still] her son and she wanted her close family around her.  nThe reason given is that they already have commitments on the day but also plan to send a gt card and a video message to be played at the party.  n  nMeghan Markleaposs aposaxedapos employee had key role at Royal Wedding and became aposmystery womanapos  nBarclays boss investigated over links to paedophile Jeffrey Epstein   nThe royal broadcaster claimed the Queen had made plans for a big party for her third childaposs birthday, one which would also celebrate his charity work.  nBut he claims to have been told by a palace source that Her Majesty is now understood to be holding only a small family dinner.  nAndrew has been hit by scandal over his relationship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, his car-crash interview with BBC Newsnight and claims he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was aged , which he denies.  n  nQueenaposs furious letter to Princess Diana that finally ended her marriage to Charles  nMeghan Markle close to tears in behind-the-scenes video of apossecret projectapos   nMr Sean said Andrew is expected to show his face for the wedding of his daughter Princess Beatrice on May .  nThe wedding has become more of a low-key event amid the public outcry, and will not be televised as other royal weddings have been.  nAnd Mr Neal told Fox News how he wasnapost sure whether Harry and Meghan would be at Beatriceaposs big day.  nHe said royal fans would have to wait and seeMeghan and Harry attend this event.  n  nHe claims a source told him that Beatrice and Meghan got on well and the elder daughter of Andrew was sad she left but they have so far been unable to keep that friendship going.  nPrince Andrew was not at Beatrice’s engagement party in London in December.  nBut on February  the Mirror reported that, in keeping with tradition, the Duke will give Beatrice away at The Chapel Royal in St Jamesaposs Palace, Buckingham Palace confirmed.  n  nHe did the same for Princess Eugenie when she married Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle in .  nThe announcement came weeks after Andrew was thrown further into the spotlight when FBI investigators looking at the Epstein case claimed he had failed to make good his promise to assist them in their work.  nThe duke has said he is “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations”.  nTop news stories from nBut FBI federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said Andrew “has provided zero co-operation”.  nThis claim reportedly left the duke “angry and bewildered”.

Neil Sean, a UK-based royal correspondent who appears on US TV, told Fox News that itaposs not very nice for the Queen. He said: A mole [told] me it’s an open secret they declined the invite but it’s not very nice for the Queen as, whatever people say and think, he is [still] her son and she wanted her close family around her. The reason given is that they already have commitments on the day but also plan to send a gt card and a video message to be played at the party. The royal broadcaster claimed the Queen had made plans for a big party for her third childaposs birthday, one which would also celebrate his charity work. But he claims to have been told by a palace source that Her Majesty is now understood to be holding only a small family dinner. Andrew has been hit by scandal over his relationship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, his car-crash interview with BBC Newsnight and claims he had sex with Virginia Giuffre when she was aged , which he denies. Mr Sean said Andrew is expected to show his face for the wedding of his daughter Princess Beatrice on May . The wedding has become more of a low-key event amid the public outcry, and will not be televised as other royal weddings have been. And Mr Neal told Fox News how he wasnapost sure whether Harry and Meghan would be at Beatriceaposs big day. He said royal fans would have to wait and seeMeghan and Harry attend this event.  He claims a source told him that Beatrice and Meghan got on well and the elder daughter of Andrew was sad she left but they have so far been unable to keep that friendship going. Prince Andrew was not at Beatrice’s engagement party in London in December. But on February  the Mirror reported that, in keeping with tradition, the Duke will give Beatrice away at The Chapel Royal in St Jamesaposs Palace, Buckingham Palace confirmed.  He did the same for Princess Eugenie when she married Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle in . The announcement came weeks after Andrew was thrown further into the spotlight when FBI investigators looking at the Epstein case claimed he had failed to make good his promise to assist them in their work. The duke has said he is “willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations”.

Parents Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children were living in a bungalow at a school where he once worked as a resident caretaker. But they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms. Through tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing. We were a happy family and we’ve been robbed. We just want to go home and be a family unit again. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. We are being treated like criminals. I’m scared I am going to lose my children. I can’t sit back and do nothing. I have four children. I have to fight for them. The Davies and their two sons - Rhys, , and George,  - are now staying in two small rooms in a converted office block  minutes from home. Their daughters - Grace, , and Emily,  - are staying where. Stay-at-home mum Mrs Davies toldthat the family moved into the three-bedroom bungalow at the now-defunct Sheredes Senior School in Hoddesdon, Herts, in January  when her husband was hired.  She said they paid £. a month in subsidised rent, were responsible for bills and maintenance, and carried out modications to accommodate Mr Daviesapos disability from severe back pain. But in July  Mr Davies, , was sacked by the school - unfairly, he claims - and the family were ordered to move out, with the council saying his right to remain in the property automatically ceased in accordance with his Service Occupancy Agreement. The family refused to leave and this led to a y legal battle that made its way to the High Court in October  and Supreme Court in . At the High Court, the Davies argued that they should be allowed to stay in the home and the council had failed to consider the welfare of their children, who were raised in the bungalow.  But the court sided with the council, saying the familyaposs right to occupy the home ended with his job and they had been trespassing ever since he was dismissed. It allowed the council to move ahead with the eviction, but remained in the bungalow, located next to the school gates, and continued to pay rent. The Davies claim they werenapost notied when the council applied for permission to enforce the writ of possession and the case went to court without their knowledge last year, meaning they werenapost giving an opportunity to mount a challenge. Mrs Davies claims the family had no idea they were being evicted until enforcement officers knocked on her door on February .  The council said since the summer of  it had asked the family a number of times to leave voluntarily, but Mr Davies refused. It said it held off from evicting the family for two years while Mr Davies appealed, and the appeals ended last summer. The eviction was authorised by the court, but the Davies claim it was unlawful because they werenapost give notice. They have launched a new challenge, arguing they were deprived of their legal right to seek a stay, and a hearing is due to take place on March . Mrs Davies, whose family have launched an online petition to publicise their case, said tearfully: There was a knock at the door and there were seven enforcement officers there to evict us.  They saidwe did not go we would be arrested and face  weeks in prison. At the end of the day, there were  enforcement officers. We were told just to take emergencies like medication and paperwork and clothes. It was absolute hell, we were in pieces. It was intimidating. At that point, we had to just go.  She added: We were illegally evicted. We were never served a notice.  The whole family has been split up. We’ve been told that the bungalow is to be sold. It’s all for profit, it is greed. The council said it has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the property. Mr Davies now works as a pest control supervisor in London. His we said he has suffered from depression and anxiety, and attempted to take his own le following a mental breakdown that occurred while he was working at the school.  He claims it was brought on by bullying and harassment in the workplace. Mrs Davies said he was sacked when he was on sick leave. Sheredes School closed in  - a year after Mr Davies was dismissed - and a new academy has since opened in its place. The council doesnapost run the school, but it still owns the bungalow at the site. After being forced out of the home, the family were put in two rooms in a hotel in Great Dumlow, Essex, and then moved into a former office block in Harlow. Mrs Davies said: The most distressing thing is Iaposm not with all of my children. Thereaposs no room for all of us.  We have two studio rooms with two single beds in each but they are not next door to each other. In my room there thereaposs a wardrobe with no hanging rail, a microwave, a washing machine and dryer, a fridge, a two-wing hob and a tiny bathroom. We have nothing to do. We have no TV. My children have no toys. All of our possessions are still in the bungalow and the locks have been changed. It was my husband’s th birthday last week, his presents are still in the home. Friends are taking care of their dog, two cats and budgee. Mrs Davies said the situation has brought anxiety and stress upon the family, adding: My sons are embarrassed. My -year-old said people are laughing because they know he was sleeping on the floor on a mattress at the hotel.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailResearchers have discovered the formula for a perfect first date - cracking three jokes, complimenting your partner at least twice and buying them three drinks. A study of , adults also revealed that you should tell at least two funny anecdotes, give them two hugs and ask for a second date no more than twice. And you should also wink at your date at least once - as well as take at least one selfie together. But the most important things to do on a first date are to be on time, be a good listener and avoid talking about your ex. Only one in  think itaposs inappropriate to kiss on a first date, with  per cent ready to go in for the smooch when the time is right. And Brits are quite willing to splash out on dates, with an average amount of £ considered to be perfect. Alexis Peppis, UK manager at Tiqets UK, a museum and attraction ticketing company which commissioned the research, said: The results have shown that Brits are keen to impress and enjoy soaking up a bit of culture along the way with a visit to inspiring locations to wow their date. Itaposs so easy to get stuck in a rut in daily le - so a date is an ideal opportunity to burst the bubble and try something a little dferent. Sharing new experiences with someone is always romantic. In , weaposre seeing these cultural activities become more popular not just when people travel, but when theyaposre at home looking for a unique date as well. After all, a trip to a museum or cultural landmark gives you a break from daily le that can change your perspective - and itaposs especially romantic to share that experience with someone .  The study also found that the perfect daytime date is a walk in a park or botanical garden, a visit to the zoo or a river cruise. But there is a new trend emerging to try something new, with  per cent loving to explore something or somewhere dferent on a first date. A third would even go for a cultural rendezvous to seem more aposworldlyapos to impress their potential beau. Those already in a relationship also think new cultural experiences adds fresh energy to a relationship, according to  per cent of those polled. It also emerged that Brits believe you should date someone for an average of seven weeks before taking them away on a romantic weekend getaway. Being this creative on a date requires some thought though, with more than a third of Brits wanting to plan ahead when setting up a date. But  per cent like a mix of order and spontaneity to keep things fresh. A quarter said you should plan your date at least a couple of days in advance, with nearly  per cent advising to do so at least a week or two ahead. But worryingly,  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, said they have never been on their perfect date. Alexis Peppis, from Tiqets, added: Even the healthiest relationship can get boringyou donapost mix it up with new experiences. A date is an opportunity to show what you find interesting - and we make it easy to find the cultural activities that will appeal the most to you and your date. More and more couples are playing tourist in their own city as a way to get a new perspective and appreciation for their hometown - or jaunting off on weekend trips to keep the spark alive.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHeartbroken friends of a Tesco boss who died off the coast of Lanzarote while paddle boarding have paid emotional tributes to him. Ofer Deshe, , died on Thursday after getting into dficulties near the pier at Famara Beach. He was rescued from the water by surfers, but went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at the scene around pm on Thursday. Israeli-born Mr Deshe, who lived in Bath, was the supermarket giant’s Head of Experience Design and Research. The sports enthusiast had lived in the UK for around  years and was MD at City of London-based digital innovation consulting firm Tobias  Tobias before joining Tesco. Design boss Jason Mesut, from Norwich, Norfolk, said in a social media tribute: “RIP Ofer Deshe. A long-time peer and competitor. “More recently a colleague and a friend. Was looking forward to meeting him next week to discuss working together again. “Hugs and love to all that were touched by his heart and his leadership.” Tim Simpson added: “A dear friend and a wonderful, kind-hearted, immensely intelligent and inspiring man. “I’m heartbroken, as I’m sure all who knew him are feeling. Rest in peace Ofer. Thank you for your friendship. I miss you massively already.” A Tesco statement said: We’re extremely sad to hear about this tragic news and our thoughts are with Ofer’s family and friends. He was a much loved and valued part of the Tesco family who will be greatly missed.We will provide whatever support we can to Ofer’s family during this dficult time. Emergency responders were alerted just after .pm on Thursday.  A spokesman for the Civil Guard said: “We can confirm a -year-old British man has died in circumstances which are still being investigated. “There is nothing at this stage to indicate the death is in any way suspicious. “The autopsy will determine the cause of death.” Well-placed sources said they believed the autopsy could point to the death being the result of natural causes and not drowning, although unsubstantiated local reports before the autopsy have indicated he died from drowning. Autopsy results are not normally made public in Spain. One source said the Brit was aided by surfers after he got into dficulties near rocks and was seen collapsing onto his stand-up paddle board before falling into the sea.

Strong winds of up to mph and heavy rain will see road closures and transport delays or cancellations at affected areas. Network Rail has advised passengers to expect disruption on many routes due to flooding and to allow more time for their journeys. The formidable Storm Dennis is likely to sweep into the country this weekend as a bomb cyclone, meaning a sudden pressure drop within the storm system and draws hurricane-force winds. Experts warn flooding could be worse than Storm Ciara last week owing to a perfect storm of heavy rain falling on saturated ground.Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst told Glasgow Live: On a slightly more technical definition, itaposs called rapid cyclogenesis. Itaposs a low pressure system which drops  milibars in  hours or more. An easier way to think of it is, itaposs a low pressure weather system that drops really quickly. The storm is expected it between am and lunchtime and kick-starts  hours of misery. They have issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend -including amber warnings on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and parts of the southwest, saying that flooding could cause a danger to le.  Power cuts are also expected as the Environment Agencysaid flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekendaposs Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already saturated ground. Newly-appointed Environment Secretary George Eustice said authorities were fully focused on ensuring that communities are protected. The Met Office said the main areas of concern on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday.  As of pm on Friday, there were  flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in places across the country. Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey. John Curtin, the Environment Agencyaposs executive director of flood and coastal risk management, said Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire were the areas he was most concerned about. Thiscould be a step up from what we have seen before, Mr Curtin said. We had a big storm last weekend,saturated catchments, snow melt and rainfall, so it is a perfect storm. More than  staff are on active incident duty and  mobile pumps have been deployed, the EA said.

Fayeaposs mum further explained, saying that her daughter was ft in tall and weighed about  lbs. The officer asked to confirm Fayeaposs last moment and said: You last saw her in the front yard, you didnapost see which way she went or anything like that  Selena answered: No, she was right in front of my front porch. She added that she had walked around and tried to locate her. I checked all the houses in my neighbourhood and anybody thataposs actually answered is out looking for her too, she added. A Cayce Department of Public Safety spokesperson told a press conference this afternoon that Fayeaposs body had been found and identied by a coroner. He said her death is being treated as a homicide but no arrests have been made yet. They also said they do not believe there is any danger to the community, who had worked hard to try and find Faye.

entire sky for alien le for the first time everThe most comprehensive search ever for UFOs or alien le i to be carried out by astronomers in an unprecedented hunt using  giant radio telescopes in New Mexico, USShareCommentsByJeremy Culley:,  FEB NewsThe move marks the most comprehensive search for alien le ever \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe entire sky is to be scoured for signs of extraterrestrial or alien activity for the first time ever. Astronomers will use  giant radio telescopes in an unprecedented hunt for other-worldly civilisations. Experts at the SETI Institute, an organisation dedicated to tracking extraterrestrial intelligence, are developing state-of-the-art techniques to detect signatures from space that indicate the possibility of extraterrestrial existence. The SETI Institute is working with the Very Large Array observatory in New Mexico, one of the world’s most powerful radio observatories. All data will be fed through a dedicated supercomputer that will search for beeps, squawks or other signatures of distant technology. “The VLA is being used for an all-sky survey and we kind of go along for the ride,” said Andrew Siemion, director of the Berkeley Seti centre. “It allows us to in parallel conduct a Seti survey. What the telescopes can pick up can range from the chemical composition of a planetaposs atmosphere, to laser emissions, to structures orbiting other stars, among others. Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatorytelescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable le is among the most compelling questions in science. SETI scientists plan to develop a system that will piggyback on the VLA and provide data to their technosignature search system. Gaining real-time access to data gathered by the VLA is considered a major coup for scientists and an indication that the field has “gone mainstream”.  Dr Beasley added: As the VLA conducts its usual scientic observations, this new system will allow for an additional and important use for the data weaposre already collecting. Le forms, whether intelligent or not, can produce detectable indicators such as large amounts of oxygen, smaller amounts of methane, and a iety of other chemicals, the experts said. So in addition, scientists are also developing computer models to simulate extraterrestrial environments that can help support future searches for habitable planets and le beyond the solar system. Victoria Meadows, principal investigator for Nasaaposs Virtual Planetary Laboratory at the University of Washington, which studies to detect exoplanetary habitability, said: Upcoming telescopes in space and on the ground will have the capability to observe the atmospheres of Earth-sized planets orbiting nearby cool stars, so itaposs important to understand how best to recognise signs of habitability and le on these planets. These computer models will help us determine whether an observed planet is more or less likely to support le. Meanwhile, SETIaposs Breakthrough Listen Initiative, which launched in  to listen for signals of alien le, has released nearly two petabytes of data from the most comprehensive survey yet of radio emissions from the plane of the Milky Way galaxy and the region around its central black hole. The organisation is now inviting the public to search the data, gathered from ious telescopes around the world, and look for signals from intelligent civilisations.

Mikako Pearse was making her way to work when she was ambushed and robbed by two men at Kingswood station in western Sydney, Australia on Wednesday morning. She was punched so hard that when she regained consciousness she has no recollection of what happened but managed to stagger the  metres to her home where her horried husband called police, news reports. Officers discovered the robbery had taken place when they checked CCTV footage near the station. Harrowing footage released by police to help Mikakoaposs her attackers shows her walking to the station before the pair approach her from behind and one man punches her and she falls to the ground. The pair can be seen picking up her backpack which contains her phone and a purse with before they flee - leaving her unconscious. Mikako is seen coming around and staggering back home. She was treated in hospital and has since been discharged. The -year-oldaposs husband Jeffrey said his we is so traumatised that she feels unable toto work or even walk to the station at all.  He added he was too scared to let her out of is sight. Mikako was covered in blood, all over her shirt and jacket, and dripping blood from a cut on her cheek, he said. She had blood running all over her face, I had to get a towel to try and stop the bleeding. She has no memory from when the guys attacked her until when she got home.  He added that they both believed she as safe walking to the station and that his beautul we didnapost deserve this to happen. Appealing for information to find her attackers, he said: Someone has attacked my we and I wasnapost there to protect her. I just want them caught. Help me get these guys. Detective Inspector Jason Pietruszka said: This was a one-punch attack on a defenceless -year-old woman.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there. That’s what Gordon keeps saying to me.“He played there when Gordon was at Celtic.“Gordon gave him his debut. He played in the Champions League for him against Villareal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dens gaffer players have to pay back dundee fans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake expects his players to give the club’s fans something back in the last few months of the season as they target a second-place finish.It’s been a trying first season as a manager for the -year-old at Dens Park with form and fortunes of his side fluctuating from week to week.After two positive results in their last two outings – a - draw at Cappielow against Morton followed up by a commanding - success over bottom side Partick Thistle – the Dark Blues gaffer is hard at work trying to stretch those reults into an extended run of form that can see Dundee earn themselves a place in the end-of-season play-offs.At times, the club’s fans have voiced their frustration at the team’s inability to prove any sort of challenge to runaway leaders Dundee United.James understands that but was pleased to see another side to the home support in last weekend’s win over the Jags.“We gave them a reason to get behind us,” he said.“Early in the game, Kane Hemmings chased a ball down, it rebounds off the defender and we get a throw-in – everybody is buzzing just because Kano chased a ball.“The supporters are then up for it and they see the players are up for it, too, with balls into the box early on.”That was a prime example of the players getting the crowd onside and the manager is demanding more of that, particularly with four home games coming up in the six matches after next Saturday’s trip to Queen of the South.Arbroath and Alloa are a home double-header before Dunfermline and then Queens check in to Dens before the end of March.“We have to give them something to be proud of – I said as much in my first interview,” he added.“I think last Saturday the fans were proud of their team.“We might not have knocked the ball about or played as fluently as we have this season but we got the three points and came away with a clean sheet and looked really comfortable.“The fans will have walked away really happy.“I think that was probably the first time at Dens this season where they walked away saying ‘it was good today’.“We have to do that, it has to come from us.“The fans will help us when it’s backs to the wall but we need to give them something.“Last Saturday we did.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/20190213-Crucible-Alba-Marketgait-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee city centre cinema plans stall amid challenging market conditions","story":"Plans to build a multiplex cinema on a vacant site in Dundee city centre are on hold # and have been for several months, the Tele understands.Ayrshire-based developers Crucible Alba Group unveiled their proposals for a nine-screen cinema and a hotel and restaurant complex on Greenmarket in early .At the time, the firm said it had entered into negotiations with a number of theatre chains and eateries to occupy the £ million facility, which was to be built throughout last year.Michael Smart, development director at Crucible Alba, previously suggested the development would act as #the final piece in the jigsaw# linking the city centre to the Waterfront.But to date, there has been no progress on the site # and sources suggest little progress has been made behind the scenes either.While Crucible Alba says the proposal remains active, it has been suggested that the project could be called off due to challenging trading conditions for chain restaurants across the UK.A source with knowledge of the project said: #There#s been no activity on itfor months.#It#s being reviewed # both in terms of finding partners and whether it will even go ahead at all.#There isn#t a great deal of confidence in the Dundee marketplace in terms of restaurant chains.#No formal planning application has ever been submitted to Dundee City Council.A spokesman for Crucible Alba said: #Crucible Alba Group are continuing discussions with ious stakeholders, potential occupiers and reviewing suggestions made at the public consultation, before finalising their proposals for the site at Greenmarket.#Dundee experienced a flurry of new chain eatery openings in the build-up to the opening of VA Dundee in September .Five Guys, Frankie and Benny#s, Tony Macaroni, Mozza, Patisserie Valerie, German Doner Kebab are among the big names to have opened up in Dundee in recent years.They helped to contribute to a £ million boom in the local food and drink industry in the space of a year.Cheers!

It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news. It was a good day all round.”The Dark Blues head into a two-week break in good mood after ending their run without victory ahead of a trip to Queen of the South on February .“It’s human nature,you lose then there’s two weeks to think about that until the next one.“It was nice to get the three points after the previous few weeks and gives us something to work on for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32aa8eca4016.34594020.jpg ","title":"james mcpake weve not scored enough set pieces","story":"James McPake wants his Dundee side to become set-piece masters to help them grab the coveted second spot in the Championship.The Dens Park gaffer was delighted to see his team open the scoring last weekend against Partick directly from a corner, something he says hasn’t happened nearly enough.James said: “We’ve not scored enough from set-pieces and we have been working on that.“With three at the back like against Partick, we are a bigger side.“With Christophe Berra, Josh Meekings and Jordon Forster they have three big men to pick up and we have more targets.“We haven’t scored enough from set-plays for the size we are and the time we spend working on that.”Defensively, James was delighted to see the Dark Blues earn just their second clean sheet since the end of October. vw, px\"  “Our three centre-backs cruised it,” he added.“Christophe didn’t get out of second gear.

others such as Kirkintilloch Rob Roy dispute it by saying their club was founded prior to .But East Craigie JFC argue that they are the only club to have an unbroken tenure in junior football since formation, even playing through both World Wars when many clubs stopped.The club was set up off the back of a cricket team made up of employees at Wallace Craigie Works who convinced their boss, known only as Mr Robertson, to buy them equipment.However strips were so expensive at the time that he suggested they continue to use them after the cricket season finished, by playing football over the winter.Originally they played as Craigie and decided to include East in their name after the owner of East Craigie Farm gave them some of his land # now Craigie Park # in exchange for a donation.In  Craigie Park was officially opened with a game against Celtic, bringing more than , spectators and press.Andy Malone, the club#s treasurer, said: #That was a big crowd for East Craigie at the time but the crowds grew to more than that as the team got more successful.#They started to win lots of trophies, one season they had four trophies, which meant they had more money and attracted better players.#At one point they even considered flying players to a match in Campbelltown, that#s how much money the club had, but they decided to send them on a three day train journey instead.#That was unheard of in the s, people didn#t even go on holidays and these guys had to take time off their work to go and play a game of football.#The Shipbuilders build their own clubhouse at Craigie Park and a wall around the ground.They had bought a house on East Dock Street from the council for five pounds, under the condition that they had to remove it, so they took it apart stone by stone and used the materials to build the wall and clubhouse.However it sadly burnt down in  when a man broke in, stole a strip to keep himself warm then set fire to the building and handed himself in to police a few days later.After that tin Nissen huts were used as dressing rooms until the s when the brick clubrooms were built, complete with a large communal bath in each of the team#s changing rooms.In recent years this clubhouse fell into a state of disrepair when the roof collapsed and in  it looked like the club might be forced to fold.Willie Lawson, club president, said: #Crowds have got much smaller now, junior football was really big at one time but now we only get about  people at the games.#That size of crowd doesn#t bring in much money and we didn#t have anywhere near enough in the pot to cover the cost of repairing the clubhouse # it was going to cost more than £k.#East Craigie was lucky enough to secure £k worth of funding from Stobswell Forum and Maryfield Regeneration Forum needed to repair the old building and build new hospitality clubrooms.Work on-site is still ongoing but plans are in place to keep East Craigie at the heart of the community.Willie said: #When the shipbuilders were here the club was a huge part of the community, everyone from the area came to the games.#It was an escape from the daily grind and they must#ve had a great camaraderie, working and socialising together.#We still have that camaraderie at the club but we want to extend it and make the club a real community hub, like it used to be # for everyone not just for football.#When the new building is compete we plan to offer it out for hire to the extended community for social groups, coffee mornings and anything  it might be needed for.#In August East Craigie JFC will play in their th season and many celebratory events will take place, including an open day and a #double platinum# dinner.Andy added: #It#s a big achievement that the club has survived for all that time when many others have folded.#We want to do everything we can to try to keep going for another  years and hopefully we have put the foundations in place to make that a reality.#East Craigie JFC was a staring ground for many of our country#s players, who then went on to play for bigger teams.Jimmy Sharp , Archie Taylorand Frank Murrayall began their career at East Craigie.There was also Alex Gilligan , Will Gilligan , John Gilliganand John Malloch .Others were G ‘Poodle’ Forbes , Jimmy Eassonand Tommy McAnearney .More recently they had Stuart Petrieand Bobbie Glenniewho played with East Craigie on his way out of the game."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-wallace-bruce-glasgow-bishop-shaped-scotlands-history","story":"ONE of the most puzzling aspects of Scotlandrsquos wars of independence is the way that prominent figures often changed allegiances, especially in the period when Robert the Bruce was fighting for ndash and indeed murdering his enemies for ndash the throne of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"masterchef-star-gary-maclean-chats-new-bbc-show-corner-shop-cook-off","story":"MASTERCHEF winner Gary Maclean will star in a new show that aims to prove you can cook a three-course meal for just pound with items bought from your local corner shop."},{"url":null,"title":"students-campaign-glasgow-universitys-3m-arms-trade-stake-re-engagement-fossil-fuels","story":"Glasgow University students have gathered in the institutionsquads to protest over the its involvement with the arms trade and potential re-engagement with fossil fuel investments."},{"url":null,"title":"mini-golf-course-set-st-enoch-centre-plans-approved","story":"A MINI-GOLF course is set to open in the St Enoch Centre, a move which will see world famous toy store Hamleys downsize."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-help-shape-glasgows-response-ecological-emergency","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS response to the climate and ecological emergency can be shaped by the public after the council launched a new consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-farting-normal-talk","story":"Because everybody farts, itrsquos normal you see,"},{"url":null,"title":"city-science-plutos-journey-fascinating-one-planet-continues-surprise-us","story":"NEXT week marks  years since Plutorsquos discovery.

respite for the people they support, the volunteers giving their time to the charity or to fundraise.Since launching last year in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Manchester, Itison Us has supported  charities and donated more than , experiences to people in need.Now expanding to Aberdeen, the initiative will support three local charities in the first month: Home Start Aberdeen Charlie House and

We are not going to let that happen and will put up a big fight.”Former Everton winger Kennedy is a realist and accepts Celtic will likely control possession for long spells. However, he insists Aberdeen will have a game plan to counter that and will go for goals against the champions.He said: “I don’t think you go into any game thinking will we sit back  However, the way Celtic control the ball it automatically pushes you back.“I have not played Celtic since I have been at Aberdeen so I don’t know how the game will pan out.“However, previously, when I was at my ex-club, Celtic controlled the ball that much it does push you back.“Then you had to try to counter on that.“We will have to see what shape Celtic go and what shape we go.”Despite Aberdeen’s struggles in front of goal since the start of the year Kennedy has been impressive since signing on from St Johnstone.When signing for Aberdeen Kennedy had not played for almost a month with his previous appearance a - draw with Ross County on December .He missed Saints’ first two games after the winter shutdown and admits that led to his match sharpness dropping before switching to Pittodrie.Now with five full  minutes under his belt he is back to full sharpness – and ready for Celtic.He said: “I didn’t play in any of those games for St Johnstone after the break. Aberdeen went away to Dubai for a hard training camp and I missed that.“I am getting my fitness back now and hopefully towards the end of the season I will have chipped in with a few goals and assists.“That is the plan anyway and hopefully I will create chances for the boys.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society.

The way things are going itrsquoll likely be a bridge between two independent countries.There is Sinn Fein winning the popular vote in Ireland and demanding a referendum on reunication. And Scotland is to have one next year, according to Nicola Sturgeon.Well, in your dreams.Therersquos unlikely to be a Scottish referendum any time soon. Sinn Fein is in no position to demand a border poll, while it remains a minority in the Irish parliament, the Dail.It wasnrsquot only or even mainly Sinn Feinrsquos policy on a United Ireland that drove leader May Lou McDonaldrsquos success. The campaign focused on housing, health and pensions.Moreover, not everyone in the Republic is enthusiastic about reuniting with the North. Even some nationalists worry about taking responsibility for the pound billion or so the UK pumps annually into The Six Counties, as Sinn Feincalls the province.Then therersquos all the sectarianism and the legacy of the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries havenrsquot gone away either. This makes it all the more remarkable that what used to be the political wing of the Irish Republican Army has become a major player in Irish politics. SF was regarded as de facto terrorist itself until recently. The idea it could ever get near forming a governing coalition was regarded as ridiculous.But after this election, Sinn Fein can no longer be dismissed as a relic of sectarianism. It came top with  per cent of the popular vote against  per cent for Fianna Dail and  per cent for Leo Varadkarrsquos Fine Gael. Had Mary Lou McDonald fielded more candidates, SF might have won more than its  seats in the Dail, one fewer than Fianna Faacuteil. It was a rare case of a political party actually under-estimating its electoral support.Seismic is an overused term in politics,but this election really is earthshaking, not least for the future of the UK. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael Taoiseach, has been looking suitably shaken.He insists he will not contemplate any alliance with ldquoextremist Sinn Feiners, one of whose TDs launched into a rendition of the Irish rebel song ldquoCome out ye Black and Tans at a Dublin count. Michael Martin of Fianna Faacuteil isnrsquot ruling out a coalition but is instinctively hostile.The establishment parties will do all in their power to lock Sinn Fein out of office during the coming weeks of coalition horse trading. But it seems unlikely they can keep the charismatic Mary Lou in her box.This is because nationalism is back in a big way in Ireland as in the UK. Yes, the grievances of young people without housing and older folk worried about pensions arenrsquot intrinsically nationalist. But these grievances are now being expressed by voting for the party of Irish nationalism par excellence.It is similar to the way many Scottish voters, with similar complaints, turned suddenly to the independence cause in , obliterating Labour in Scotland.Radical nationalism is now the driving force in modern politics. It is redrawing the political map across Europe as voters turn away from neoliberalism and globalism.We see it in the Yellow Vest movement in France, in populist parties in Italy and, yes, even in Brexit. That was essentially an English nationalist rebellion against the EU.The BBCrsquos former World Affairs Editor, John Simpson, attracted much criticism for tweeting his regret that Ireland had ldquosuccumbed to populism. The implication is that Sinn Fein remain extremist and its success is a bad thing.Commentators like Simpson used to say much the same about Alex Salmondrsquos SNP. Many metropolitan intellectuals still regard populism as synonymous with racism and bigotry.But this equation of nationalist movements with the political right makes little sense. Both the SNP and Sinn Fein triumphed from the left. All nationalisms not the same.Fianna Faacuteil and Fine Gael are also nominally nationalist parties, dating from the Irish Civil War. Theyrsquore ldquoSoldiers of Destiny and ldquoTribe of the Irish respectively. Sinn Fein, meaning ldquoWe Ourselves actually sounds less militantly nationalist.In recent years theyrsquove become identikit centrist parties. Fine Gael is generally considered slightly more right wing and pro big business than Fianna Faacuteil, which used to represent farmers and small business. But itrsquos hard to tell. The two old parties are basically rival networks of patronage, cronyism even, with little ideological depth.Fianna Faacuteil had the misfortune to be in office during the  financial crash, which hit Ireland hard. The country was traumatised by the weight of debt left by the collapse of the Irish banks.Fine Gael under its seemingly more progressive Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, thought it had inherited the upswing. In GDP terms it has. Ireland has one of the highest growth rates in Europe and national income per head is higher than the UKrsquos.Mr Varadkar, who is openly gay, won plaudits for legalising abortion and same-sex marriage. But this progressive gloss did not prevent Fine Gael being seen as in the pockets of rampant capitalism.He won the battle of Brexit too, but lost the war for domestic popularity as young and old turned in disgust from the grotesque inequalities of wealth in Ireland. Brexit was not, by common consent, a signicant issue in the election. But it must have played a part,only subliminally.The North is to remain in regulatory alignment with the Republic, while Britain erects a border in the Irish Sea. This de facto economic reunication of Ireland has transformed the border question.Itrsquos no longer a question of Brits out. Theyrsquore going. Irish nationalism is no longer about the gun, but about the EU single market. The dream of Irish unity is becoming a reality through the ballot box. Formal unication seems only a matter of time.The SNP has historically shunned Sinn Fein, fearing guilt by association. That must surely now change. It is now a legitimate democratic force.But there is a warning here for Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP canrsquot afford to abandon its left-wing radicalism, or trade it for LGBT and gender politics. If the SNP becomes another party of the establishment it could share the fate of Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-secretary-brands-idea-northern-ireland-bridge-link-vanity-project","story":"Boris Johnson has said work is under way to establish the feasibility of a road crossing between Portpatrick in Dumfries and Galloway and Larne in Co Antrim.The devolved administrations said the estimated pound billion cost should fund vital projects in both countries instead and expressed anger that they had not been consulted.:Whitehall officials begin scoping work on Boris Bridge linking Scotland and Northern IrelandScottish transport secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI strongly believe thatpound billion is available for investment in infrastructure in Scotland and Northern Ireland that, rather than indulging the Prime Minister with this vanity project, such funding should be made available to our respective governments so it could be better spent on meeting the priorities of the people we represent.Downing Street said a ldquorange of officials were looking at the idea, but was unable to say how many civil servants were examining proposals.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said it was a ldquoproper piece of work and Mr Johnson was ldquoambitious about infrastructure projects across the country.Mr Johnson has repeatedly spoken about the prospect of a bridge, even though experts have warned that the depth of the Irish Sea and the presence of dumped munitions would cause problems for any project.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon said: ldquoI am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing pound billion, will be a waste of signicant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and where.ldquoBy spending just a fraction of the reported cost of this bridge, I am of the view that we could bring signicantly more benefits to people across the north by investing in infrastructure here and making a real dference to improving the lives of citizens across Northern Ireland.The distance from Larne to Portpatrick, one of the most likely routes for a bridge, is around  miles.There is no problem with distance, money or the Beaufortrsquos Dyke explosives disposal area, according to the Prime Minister.:Prime Minister brands idea of Boris bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland very interestingAn engineer has suggested the span could be ready within  years.In a letter to UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Mr Matheson called for urgent talks with the UK Government.He wrote: ldquoGiven transport is devolved to both the Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive, I look forward to hearing from you on the availability of the pound billion to us, and to assurances that in future any such proposals will be discussed with us first and will fully respect the devolved settlements and the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"A REDDER face than usual this week for Jackson Carlaw after he slagged the Queensferry Crossing for closing due to falling ice.

The PM stressed we must demonstrate that the UK is open and welcoming from talent from across the world but the new system would end reliance on importing cheap, low-skilled labour, bringing down immigration numbers overall.Under existing legislation, workers from the EU and European Economic Area countries can come to the UK to live or work without a visa. But Mr Johnson is keen to close the route for low-skilled migrants but short-term visas will be considered for occupations experiencing shortages.It has been calculated the new points-based system could cut the number of low-skilled EU migrants by , per year, which would represent a  per cent reduction in the numbers of EU citizens who come to the UK on a long-term basis.Asked about the possibility of a change in the salary cap, the spokesman declined to answer and said the details of the new system would be ldquoset out shortly.Questioned about how migration numbers would be cut, he said the new system would enable the Government to control the number of people coming into the UK it would, by its very nature, ldquoprovide the Government to control who comes in and out and would end the countryrsquos ldquoreliance on low-skilled workers.Askedthere was a target and how soon migrant numbers would fall, the spokesman simply repeated that details of the new system would be set out shortly.Pressed on whether there was discussion on any special dispensation for Scotland ndash the Scottish Government wants policy on immigration to be devolved ndash he said he would not go into the detail of Cabinetrsquos ldquowider discussion.But Stuart McDonald for the SNP described the Governmentrsquos approach as a ldquototal shambles.He noted how the Tory Government had had  months to produce proposals for a new migration system but people still knew ldquonext to nothing about what it will look like.Mr McDonald insisted: ldquoFree movement is about the only bit of the UK migration system that works well we should retain it, not scrap it.The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added: ldquoConfirmation Boris Johnson is still intent on cracking down on so-called low skilled migration is massively concerning.

If Whitehall joked that Javid was \"chino\" - chancellor in name only- his successor can expect even less respect.\"Although the power of Cummings now seems unprecedented, seasoned observers are waiting for him to overstep the mark.

Peatlands are renowned for their ability to soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, to promote bioersity and to provide high quality water.The Thurso-based scientists will benefit from access to the Flow Country, the largest blanket bog in Europe and a region that is under consideration for World Heritage Site status ndash joining the ranks of Australiarsquos Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon in America and the Taj Mahal in India.The project will also support new initiatives across the universityrsquos research centres and foster national and international collaborations, including work with Canadian peatland research groups.Dr Andersen said: ldquoPeatlands are the Earthrsquos most efficient terrestrial carbon store. They regulate water and climate and support unique bioersity.ldquoHowever, their degradation affects the delivery of these key s. In the UK, the cool, wet climate supports a globally rare peatland type: blanket bogs.ldquoMost UK blanket bogs have been degraded by human activities and, left alone, they make a signicant contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector. However, unprecedented efforts to restore our blanket bogs are under way, for example through the Peatland Action programme in Scotland.ldquoAstonishingly, we do not know the extent to which these interventions work or how blanket bogs, restored or otherwise, will cope with the added threat of climate change.ldquoI am thrilled to have been chosen by the Leverhulme Trust for this Research Leadership Award. I look forward to working with my team to pioneer approaches from molecular to landscape scales to fill some of these gaps in our knowledge and to inform UK and global peatland management strategies.The project will focus on three key areas of research. The team will explore how environmental conditions can affect Sphagnum mosses, one of the building blocks of peat in blanket bog.They will continue to develop a method that uses satellite data to measure how the seasonal patterns of swelling and shrinking of bog surface, known as ldquobog breathing, change in response to climate extremes and restoration activities. They will also work to refine models that predict how blanket bogs may respond to dferent management approaches in future climate change scenarios.Emma Goodyer, manager of the International Union For The Conservation Of Nature Uk Peatland Programme, said: ldquoThe area covered by near natural peatland worldwidestores more carbon than all other vegetation types in the world combined. However, drained and damaged peatlands contribute about  per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from the land use sector annually, despite covering only .% of the global land surface.ldquoScotland has become a global leader in peatland management. The research hub in the Flow Country has been instrumental in delivering programmes of research that tackle some of the most pressing issues for peatland restoration and policy. This signicant funding boost will offer the opportunity to understand the resilience of peatland ecosystems in the face of the climate crisis whilst also reversing bioersity losses.The Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland has bogs in the tundra-like landscape that have been growing since the end of the last Ice Age more than , years ago.

It’s always very interesting when we get an unusual request like this, and we’re delighted to be able to help restore a building of such signicant historical interest.”The building slowly fell into a state of decline and in  was declared unsafe by the fire department.Two years later it was bought by a developer and the major refurbishment will see the building reopen its doors as a plush hotel, with retail space and a number of private apartments.The pillars have been produced, polished and finished at Fyfe Glenrock’s base in Oldmeldrum and are now being shipped to the USA where, said Mr Collinson, they will not look out of place.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Respitality support worker Ann Brodie alongside colleagues from Energie Fitness\"  ‘Respitality’ links to support carers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"vehicles are in demand at thainstone","story":"ANM Group hosted its first collective machinery sale of the year on Saturday, January .The sale saw more than , buyers and sellers in attendance at Thainstone Centre.The auction featured an entry of more than , items and achieved a strong sales rate of  percent.Mark Barrack, head of Thainstone Specialist Auctions, said: “Consistent prices were achieved across all sections with the light commercial and x vehicles category seeing several lots sell in excess of high trade guide prices due to the scarcity of quality stock available in the wider market.“The tractors section was outstanding again, and strong conversion rates were achieved for heavy commercials with many buyers from England bidding keenly. “Scotland’s largest sale of plant, machinery and equipment continues to grow in popularity, and we’re delighted with the strong start to .

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

America’s Uncle Joe, Obama’s right-hand man, Joe Biden, former Vice-President of the world’s richest country, stumbled from New Hampshire to South Carolina in search of the African American votes that may yet save his presidential ambitions.But he looks a broken man, his ebullient personality dampened by the rise of noisy left-winger Bernie Sanders and the more moderate,slightly duller, Pete Buttigieg. Vice President Biden’s retirement from the public stage may be only a few weeks away.Saulos Chilima, on the other hand, is a vice-president with a future. First elected as Malawi’s number two in , the former telecoms chief executive failed in his bid to become his country’s youngest president last year. His former party boss, Peter Mutharika, won a second term.: The country where average income is £ a year and aid workers stay in £-a-night hotels – Susan Dalgety: Malawi gives us a warm welcome while the UK is hostile in– Patrick Grady MPSome said his political career had ended before he reached . “He is going back to the corporate world,” they whispered. But last Monday, Malawi’s constitutional court ruled the  presidential election null and void, called for a new poll by  July, and in a move that surprised everyone, including Chilima, re-instated the  presidential team until the new election.‘Call to national duty’Dressed in casual but smart sports gear, sitting behind the desk of his private office in one of Lilongwe’s leafier suburbs, Vice President Saulos Chilima looks more like a corporate boss working from home than a senior African leader.Apart from the very friendly soldier on guard at the entrance to his home, there is no pomp or ceremony surrounding him. No entourage. No hangers-on. Just a few builders working on his home and that smiling soldier. “I’ll be with you in a moment,” he said, “Please sit,” he added, as he finished some paperwork.A few minutes later he turned his full attention to me, and in perfect English, invited me to ask my questions. “We have  minutes,” he added, in a very business-like manner.I glanced at my list. “Why did you give up a successful career as chief executive of Airtel to become a politician,” I asked, too quickly.He relaxed. Then laughed. “I will repeat what I said before, it was a call to national duty. People told me that I had the potential to contribute to the greater good, so I discussed it with my family, with other people.“Some told me politics was dficult, but I opted to set aside my private sector career to respond to the call, to seemy expertise, the knowledge that I had acquired over many years, could be used to benefit many more people than just myself.”Marathon runnerHis CV is a glittering testament to a successful career in the private sector. An economist by trade, with a PhD in knowledge management, he worked for Unilever and Coca-Cola before joining Airtel Malawi, where he rose to chief executive. During his time in charge, the company grew from , customers in  to . million by .And his sports gear is not for show. He runs marathons, is a regular gym-goer, and at , still plays basketball. “Our bodies are the best God-given gts. These we must look after and invest in accordingly,” he said in a recent interview.A devout Catholic, father of two children, Sean and Elizabeth, his we Mary is regarded as a huge political asset. “She is full of le, very bright,” says one associate. “She will make a great first lady,” says another.But first Chilima has to be elected President. He missed his first chance last year, when he came third with  per cent of the national vote. Lazarus Chakwera, leader of the MCP, polled  per cent and Chilima’s old boss scraped in with  per cent.He won’t be drawnhe will stand in the new presidential elections in a few months’ time.He smiled. “We will see, there are discussions happening,” he says, enigmatically, alluding to talks between his UTM party and other opposition groups.Good governanceThe numbers may look stacked against him, but the court’s ruling that the new election must be run on a  per cent plus one basis gives him a chance of victory. And whathe did become leader of one of the world’s poorest countries “I wish we had the luxury of saying this is priority number one, number two, number three. Unfortunately, we don’t. “Food security is an issue. Health is an issue. Unemployment. Education. Security. Gender is an issue.“They need to be dealt with in tandem. Butwe say, let’s try and do some prioritisation, we need to deal with food security once and for all. We must make our agriculture sector work properly.“We also need to do away with avoidable diseases, through better health and education.“Then you would begin to look at young people, the empowerment of women. We must develop our human capital.“And for all of this to work, you must have good governance as the centre-piece. We need to get rid of fraud and corruption. The judgement last week showed the rule of law works here.”‘Three meals a day’The successful corporate boss who cites Coca-Cola’s business model as an inspiration is also a classic Keynesian. At times of trouble – and Malawi’s economy is most certainly suffering – Chilima believes the government should borrow to invest in the country’s future.His party’s  manesto promised “one million jobs in one year”, a pledge that many ridiculed, not least the BBC’s Zeinab Badawi during a recent HARDtalk interview.But Chilima is unabashed. “Of course, it can be done, it is doable,” he told me.“We have to find a way of jump-starting the economy. One way is a loan fund for the people who already have business. Invest there, so their businesses will grow, and they employ more people. Invest in the village banks, the co-operatives where people lend to each other to support economic activity.“Invest in infrastructure, and the construction sector absorbs a lot of people immediately. They need suppliers, and they need to eat. The chain continues. We have a simple promise,” he says, drawing the interview to a close,  minutes after my allotted half hour. “We want a happy nation, to be a middle-income economy where people enjoy three meals a day,” he says, walking me back to the gate. “And we can do it.”Vice President Biden’s political career may be drawing to a close in the southern states of America, but here, in the heart of southern Africa, it feels asVice President Chilima’s is just about to take off.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"hero edinburgh bus driver takes sick passenger to a e in double decker lothian bus","story":"However, on the same day two fires ravaged Liberton Primary School and the clubhouse at Myreside, staff at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmarywere forced to react to an unexpected vehicle in their emergency department.When a woman on the top deck of the bus driven by Ian Bunclark began exhibiting symptoms of a seizure, the quick-thinking bus driver made the snap decision to head directly to the accident and emergency department at the ERI in an attempt to get her medical help as soon as possible, rather than waiting for an ambulance.Mr Bunclark, who has  years of experience as a Lothian bus driver, had already been forced to deal with disruption and complications due to a ersion caused by the fire at Liberton Primary before the woman fell ill on Wednesday at around .pm.After driving to the ERI from the route his number three bus was on, hospital and NHS workers leaped into action.Initially heading in the wrong direction, NHS employees opened an access gate and helped the bus get to AE by moving cars out of the way and stopping all non-emergency traffic from driving down the road.The Emergency Department team rushed to find two paramedics who boarded the bus to treat and bring the sick woman off the bus and onto a hospital bed.Such was the heroism and quick thinking, the lady was discharged from hospital later that night.Delighted by drivers quick thinkingJim Small, Lothian busesrsquo chief operating officer said Mr Bunclarkrsquos actions were an example of the companyrsquos employees going above and beyond.He said: ldquoWe are delighted that Ianrsquos quick thinking actions together with the assistance of customers on-board and the specialist team at NHS Lothian ensured this lady received the medical attention she needed. ldquoLothianrsquos drivers are well-known for going above and beyond to deliver for our customers on a daily basis and wersquore glad that on this occasion we were able to assist.Janice Alexander, site director at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh, said it was yet another example of NHS Lothian staff using their training and quick thinking to help patients.She said: ldquoWhether it is our car parking teams, our domestics, our doctors or nurses our staff work together day in, day out to treat, care for and support patients and visitors at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh.ldquoI am delighted that on Wednesday, our quick-thinking teams were able to assist, ensuring that the patient received swt medical care. ldquoThank you to everyone involved and we wish the patient well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by Chief Constable Simon Byrne as “seismic and historic”.It was the first time such a senior Sinn Fein figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh.The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have branded as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack.The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries.Mr Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in  as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, Ms McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by Ms O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”.She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.The party leader said: “Already in the Executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations, a new house building programme has been announced.“Additional funding has been made available for education and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverMan who died in Tollymore river tragedy named as Arnie Clarke Convicted terrorist refused permission to take partner to Republic for five night breakFamiliar facesas Stormont#s new Spads,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The future of a second surgery in the city is also uncertain, with the Health and Social Care Board searching to find a GP to take on the contract by June.The latest figures were released by the health minister, Robin Swann, in response to a question submitted by DUP MLA Jim Wells.Former health minister Mr Wells said addressing the problem of recruitment and retention of GPs in Northern Ireland must be a priority for Mr Swann.If I were still in post, I would be extremely concerned about this, he said. Of course, Mr Swann might argue that only four GP practices have closed but the reality is that the patients from  surgeries have been shared out amongst neighbouring practices.That puts additional pressure on the GPs who have taken on the additional patients.I think we really need to be looking at bringing in a mechanism whereby people who do their medical degree in Northern Ireland must work here for five years after they graduate.The last figure I saw for the cost of training up a doctor was something horrendous like £, and that was quite a while ago.The doctors we train are very highly skilled and it#s only natural that other countries would want to make use of their knowledge and expertise, but we spend so much money training them that it seems only fair that they should spend some time working here.I think this would stop our doctors leaving straight away to take up jobs in Vancouver or Sydney or other parts of the world.Northern Ireland#s GP crisis has been blamed on a number of factors.These include a failure by health officials to plan for the high proportion of GPs reaching retirement age, as well as the increasing demands on the service.More care is now provided in the community and there is a growing ageing population.The workload has become so intolerable that GPs are choosing to leave their jobs or take early retirement.At the same time, it is dficult and sometimes impossible to find doctors to take on jobs in GP surgeries, leading to the collapse of practices across Northern Ireland.This has resulted in the Health and Social Care Board struggling to find alternative arrangements, including asking other GP practices to take on thousands of patients from closing surgeries.Dr Alan Stout, chair of the British Medical Association#s GP committee in Northern Ireland, said work is being done to improve conditions for family doctors.Multi-disciplinary teamsare being rolled out across NI which is helping to address workload, he said. However, he stressed that it is imperative that the crisis is tackled to ensure the best outcomes for patients.It#s vital as the future of the health service is dependent on a strong and robust primary care service, he said.It#s the first point of contact for patients in % of cases and when it experiences issues, like the dficulties that are occurring at the moment, there are reverberations throughout the rest of the health service.If primary care is struggling, we see emergency departments struggling, referrals go up, prescribing suffers, it really does impact on every other part of the health service.Mr Swann said: The number of GP training places has been signicantly increased over the last few years, from  in  to  in . Initiatives are also in place to support GPs toor remain in general practice through the GP induction and refresher scheme and the GP retainer scheme.Mr Swann added that the MDTs are the cornerstone of our plans to transform the health service.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverMan who died in Tollymore river tragedy named as Arnie Clarke Convicted terrorist refused permission to take partner to Republic for five night breakFamiliar facesas Stormont#s new Spads,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The figures came to light following an Assembly written question from TUV leader Jim Allister.In response to his question the department revealed that £,, had been spent on Irish medium education from   to  .The figures for   include allocations to date and are subject to change.Mr Allister said the money put to bed the idea of the Irish language sector in Northern Ireland being any kind of poor relation when it comes to funding. However, Comhairle na Gaelscolaiochta , which promotes Irish language medium education and schools in Northern Ireland, said Irish language schools were still being left behind when compared with their English counterparts. A CnaG spokesperson said that it costs just £ more per year to educate children through Irish medium than the English system and that this made up .% of the overall education budget in Northern Ireland. The highest spend came in   when the Department for Education provided £,, to the Irish language sector, with the lowest being the £,, committed for  . There are currently over  Irish medium schools in Northern Ireland at primary and post-primary level. Irish language provision has been a controversial topic in Northern Ireland in recent years. Stormont collapsed in January  partly due to the withdrawal of funding from the Liofa Irish language bursary scheme. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJim Allister FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein refused toto Stormont without a standalone Irish Language Act in place. The New Decade New Approach deal, agreed last month to restore the Stormont institutions, includes a number of measures to promote the Irish language, including the appointment of an Irish language commissioner, however the deal falls short of a standalone act. Mr Allister said that the funding given the schools was very generous and rejected claims the language was underfunded.“In light of the fact that for years we have been fed propaganda about alleged discrimination against Irish speakers these figures will doubtless come as shock to anyone who gave any credit to the claims, the North Antrim MLA said. “In truth the Irish language sector is in receipt of very generous sums of public money. Over £ million in the past five years.“These figures should put to bed the idea that Irish is the poor relation when it comes to public funding in Northern Ireland. It also strengthens the case against the Irish Language legislation proposed by Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill. There is no basis on which to warrant further endless squander on Irish when essential public services are under serious pressure.”SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone rejected Mr Allister#s comments, saying that whether children were educated through the English or Irish mediums their education would still have to be paid for by the department. Whether they are educated in English or Irish it will still have to be paid for by the public purse, the fluent Irish speaker said.When you look at the education crisis we have at the minute I don#t think there is a school in the country that would accept they get too much money.I think Jim Allister should go and visit some of these Irish language schools and then seehe still thinks they are being over-funded. The CnaG spokesperson that Irish medium schools had to go through the same development process as any other school before being approved.For people asking why we need further funding, at present % of Irish medium schools are housed in non-permanent buildings, the spokesperson said. We are the fastest growing education sector at present, we have no assessment tools and no learning support centres. There is a complete lack of teaching and learning resources at all levels.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverMan who died in Tollymore river tragedy named as Arnie Clarke Convicted terrorist refused permission to take partner to Republic for five night breakFamiliar facesas Stormont#s new Spads,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Michelle O#Neill has said it. Conor needs to find the courage to do the same.Why will he not speak the same words as his Sinn Fein colleagues Mrs Quinn will arrive in Parliament Buildings as MLAs gather for a plenary session.We are delighted to have the opportunity to talk to the politicians face-to-face, she said.We will be appealing to them to use whatever influence they have with Conor because he hasn#t listened to us so far.I would hope that our presence in Parliament Buildings would encourage him to look into his heart and say the words that would mean so much to us.Mrs Quinn said that Mr Murphy had a big job now as Finance Minister. She said: I know that he#s has a lot of things to do but he still has a responsibility to my family given the great wrong he did us in .We appreciate what Mary Lou and Michelle have done.

Stormont#s Finance Committee has written to the minister telling him that his conduct calls into question his fitness for office.The letter asks him to explain why he branded Paul a criminal and why he denied the comments for the past  years.It states: It is the committee#s view that your conduct calls into question your fitness for office.Responding to the letter, a Sinn Fein spokesman said: When Conor Murphy took up the post of Finance Minister only weeks ago, nearly all of these parties wished him well and supported him in the role.And now, over the last week, they have developed serious considerations about his place in office over remarks made  years ago.Conor has written to the family, unreservedly withdrawn his remarks and apologised, and he continues to carry out the important task of Finance Minister.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverMan who died in Tollymore river tragedy named as Arnie Clarke Convicted terrorist refused permission to take partner to Republic for five night breakFamiliar facesas Stormont#s new Spads,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That feeling of love and happiness between the three of us was just perfect. This led to a conversation between my son and I, and later his girlfriend and his dad, about what holding hands means, about the memories it provokes and how we hold hands.How we hold hands  I hear you ask, don’t we all hold hands the same  Well I thought we did but no we don’t. . There’s the palm together hand hold, the fingers entwined hand hold, the just fingertips entwined hand hold and there are more. Which one you are, my son told me, depends on who you are holding hands with! Well I disagreed I always hold hands in a palms together way - but apparently that’s just a mummy hold according to my son!. Yes, his dad disagreed, but my son’s girlfriend didn’t.So, what does holding hands mean, what does it make us think, what does it make us feel and remember  George was smiling as he remembered his grandad holding his wrist - yes, his wrist not his hand - to cross the road. George said he really didn’t like this as he was about eight years old at the time but he does remember letting his grandad do it because he thought it made his grandad happy. His dad laughed when George said this and told George his grandad did the same to him – hmmm, I wonder, will this become a family tradition  I remember holding hands with my mum lots of times, but most of all I remember her sliding her little finger up my wrist as she held my hand and that this would make us both laugh together. My son’s girlfriend said, although she remembered holding hands with her mum, she also remembered always holding hands with her best friend everywhere they went. Personally, I can remember telling my son that he had to hold my hand when we were out so I didn’t get lost - great excuse to keep him safe. I had this same “holding hands” conversation later that week with my friend who told me she loved holding hands with her little one as they sing row your boat and with her older child who loves to walk on the walls in front of people’s houses. I think a favourite of mine, apart from that with my son nieces and mum, of course , is when I am in school or nursery and I see all the children holding hands with mum or dadchattering away and smiling together. I’m smiling as I’m writing remembering all these things - I know you’ll have your own happy hand holding memories too. It’s a simple gesture but does show how much we care, how much we love, does send a message of caring through touch, does support a loving bond, can help us feel, and give, security and a feeling of belonging to each other. googletag.cmd.push But, as our babies, toddlers and children grow into pre-teens the hand holding begins to disappear - unless you are lucky enough to have an affectionate teenage daughter.So, enjoy it today, remember the feeling of those little hands in yours, take time to hold hands together whether walking along, sitting and watching tv or singing a simple rhyme. For these memories will take you through the stroppy teenage years - teenage years wherein their idea of holding hands with you in public is just the most embarrassing thing ever, and all the way to Grandparent days!!!Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

But that changed when he started at St. Patricks Athletic in April and scored a picture perfect free kick that helped his team on their way to a convincing away win. Slowly but surely Bruna began to have more influence on the pitch and it got to the point where Declan Devine could no longer ignore that fact. Bruna became a regular starter and was hugely influential, his range of passing ability on a cultured left foot key to unlocking defences, as teams such as UCD and Finn Harps found out to their dismay. Bruna has settled off the pitch as well, his young family loving le in Derry, and that convinced him to sign a new deal at the club. A dferent kind of midfielder, the type that every successful team needs, Bruna could yet again have a signicant part to play. He missed the end of last season with a knee injury, but he is back fit and raring to go. “I had to work extremely hard in the off season to be in the best shape possible for this coming season and thats what Ive been doing,” he explained. “I knew it was going to be a tough off-season because of how I finished the last campaign. I have been working with Mickeytrying to fix what I was carrying and Im just really happy with the place Im in now.”Bruna was involved in some memorable encounters throughout the  campaign and he admitted he was impressed with the standard in his first season in League of Ireland football.“I would probably say yes, I think it was very good,” he continued. “I have played in a lot of dferent places, dferent countries with dferent levels of football and I was really impressed. It was a nice surprise. Im looking forward to the season now and hopefully I cam compete hopefully a little bit better than last year.”Inidually and collectively, there are goals for everyone this season, and Bruna is hoping to stay clear of further injuries so that he, and his team mates, can strive to build on the giant strides made last season.“I feel good,” he insisted. “I tried to do the best I could and try to do what the staff wants me to do by helping the team, distributing the ball and moving it around and helping the players in front of me create chances so thats what Im going to keep doing. Im going to keep working hard and enjoying it and hopefully I can do well.“We achieved Europe last year and hopefully we can achieve it again this year. We probably want to a little bit better. Obviously we dont want to put too much pressure on ourselves but I do think we can, with the lads that have come in and the squad we have this season, I think we can do really well. Lets not just say it, but go out there and do it.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Despite playing well that day, Derry left empty handed, which was of little consolation considering the importance of points at this stage of the season. “I try not to look at the table too much because it is completely psychological,” McCarter admitted. “You can be playing really well and still sitting second or third bottom, but you knowyou pick up four or five points, you can be well up that table. We have to keep our eyes off the table and concentrate on the matches and make sure our performances are worthy of those points.“We have itchy feet after three weeks, especially after a defeat because you just want to try and put it right the following Saturday, but whenever you have a two or three week break you cant do that. You just try and stay productive and keep focused on the next game and its finally coming around.”City of Derry played miserably in their last home game against Midleton but still won, whilst they scored three tries at Enniscorthy but came away with nothing. Its never straightforward when it comes to Derry this season. “It was actually a really encouraging performance,” McCarter reflected. “I know we had beaten Midleton but we were disappointed with how we had played that day. On the flip side of that, we gave a good account of ourselves against Enniscorthy but we got nothing from it. “It was really frustrating from that point of view. We definitely deserved something from that game, evenit was a losing bonus point, but to come away with nothing other than that encouraging performance was frustrating. It has been a long few weeks now and were just looking forward to getting back into it on Saturday.” googletag.cmd.push Must winThere is no getting away from the importance of this weeks home game against Bangor, who sit two places and one point above Derry. A victory could take Derry into the top five, but defeat could all but end any hopes of a play-off place. That reality is not lost on anyone at the club. “Looking at the table, everyone is right beside us so they are all big games for us,” McCarter agreed. “Saturday just feels really important being a home game, being an Ulster derby, and the fact that they are closest to us in the table. It is a big one, and we just have to try and play the game and not the occasion, We cant be overawed. We want to play rugby, we want to play the way weve been training and sometimes you can get away from that when the occasion has been hyped up.”Whatever the weather this Saturday, and whatever the performance, McCarter just wants the win. At this stage of the season, thats all that matters.“Were desperate to win it,” he said. “I was frustrated after Midleton but I would take that every week as opposed to a gloried defeat like we had in Enniscorthy. Were prepared for whats going to be a mentally tough last few weeks. We have got to get ourselves up for it and find ways of winning these games.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.

However, a buoyant St Maryrsquos outfit replied with points from Cora Convery, Alishia Lundy and Shannon Sloan to maintain their six-point lead.Six points quickly became  by the half-time break as St Maryrsquos continued to terrorise St Fanchearsquos and scores from Doran , Abi Murphyand the lethal Shannon Sloangave the locals a commanding - to - lead.St Franchearsquos came out fighting in the second half, scoring a goal and two points without reply to reduce the arrears to  point, but that was as good as it got as St Maryrsquos quickly regained the initiative and went for broke.They certainly put the foot on the gas and points from Erin Sands, Katie Convie and Cara Doran had St Maryrsquos well clear St Fanchearsquos kept on to the bitter end and forced a great save form St Marys goalkeeper Fia McFaul as they tried to get back into contention.However, McFaul and her defensive wall of Keely OrsquoNeill, player of the match Nora Maguire, team captain Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy and Lucy Morgan kept St Fanchearsquos at bay.At midfield, Eimear Teggart and Erin Sands dominated throughout the game and kept their dazzling forward busy with a constant supply of good ball.Abi Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convery, Shannon Sloan and Katie Convie were literally unplayable and gave the St Fanchearsquos defence a torrid time all afternoon.St Maryrsquos: Fia McFaul, Keely OrsquoNeill, Nora Maguire, Neva Loudon, Katie Black, Louise Lundy, Lucy Morgan, Eimear Teggart, Erin Sands, Abie Murphy, Cara Doran, Alishia Lundy, Cora Convie, Shannon Sloan, Katie Convie.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

The clear message from voters of all parties was that our Province could not continue to drt after three years without local decisions on everyday issues like our roads, schools and hospitals.By Arlene Foster, First MinisterSaturday, th February , : am\"\"Arlene FosterAlthough the New Decade New Approach deal is not perfect it was fair and balanced. We should take the elements about respecting each other’s identity and use it as the vehicle for promoting a vibrant and prosperous Northern Ireland, as an active and integral and part of the UK, as we approach the centenary of the place we are proud to call home.Those pretending that the political vacuum of the last three years was in Unionism’s best interests offer only a short-sighted strategy. That is not the position of the DUP. The reality is that people living in every part of Northern Ireland whatever their political outlook, want delivery of effective frontline services, not the ision of a border poll or distraction of recycling the Brexit debate. Despite some of the spin, the  RTE exit poll showed almost one in five of SF voters didn’t even support a border poll. Instead % prioritised healthcare.We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everywhere has a genuine and active stake in determining their future. Despite its accepted weaknesses and frustrations, devolution is still the key to this. Yesterday I attended a business breakfast in the Castlereagh Hills. There I presented my vision of making our Province a better place to live, work, grow up, raise a family and do business. That means building a dynamic and successful regional economy. Protecting first and foremost unfettered access for trade with Great Britain, in both directions, and ensuring local interests are met in the implementation of Brexit. It means pursuing better infrastructure connections both with Great Britain and between dferent hubs of jobs and growth within Northern Ireland. This will increase the number of households seeing practical benefits of living their lives within the fth largest global economy.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is not in the wider interests of unionism to allow the brain drain to continue. We are committed to working with domestic and international businesses to identy skills gaps and create better links between education routes at all levels and the needs of employers not just tomorrow but in five or ten years’ time. All the while ensuring affected sectors like agri-food and hospitality have access to the outside labour they need in the short-term. At the same time we have to showcase Northern Ireland, building on the strong tourism brand already established. Earlier this week the Tourism NI’s Visitor Attitude Survey reported that % of visitors to Causeway Coast and Glens thought it met or exceeded expectations. The future for Northern Ireland as a positive brand is bright. The possibilities are limitless and we will work proactively with the newly appointed Cabinet Minister for the Constitution and Devolution to make even further strides.Last year the DUP began work on developing a “Next Generation Unionism” approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case rather and building the broadest possible support. I am clear that restoring Stormont isn’t a barrier to a vibrant and forward-looking brand of Unionism. It presents a fresh impetus that we must be ambitious to exploit. The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

She saw the fairnessof our case but that ultimately moving on it would depend on other things happening.Of course it is possible that her response was tailored by the fact that she needed our nomination.This possibility was forcefully raised at the meeting so we were all aware of that possibility.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
