The waiter asks if she wants a Cosmopolitan, the drink she made famous as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City. \u0027Nope.

And while the bottles look alike, you aren\u0027t the same as me.\u0027 \u0027Stars drink it, chefs drink it, farmers want one when its hot. There\u0027s a coke here if you\u0027re thirsty, but that\u0027s cool if you\u0027re not.\u0027 \u0027We all have different hearts and hands, don\u0027t you see? Difference is beautiful - and together is beautiful too.\u0027 MICHELOB ULTRA  Michelob Ultra, which features Colombian singer Maluma, looked to the future to try and promote its light beer on Super Bowl Sunday. The ad imagines a world where robots walk among humans and, for the most part, outperform us. They are running faster than us on morning jogs, golfing better than us, and killing it at spin class. But when one robot passes by a bar, where friends are sharing a few pints together, one major flaw is revealed - they can\u0027t enjoy a beer. \u0027It\u0027s only worth it, if you can enjoy it,\u0027 the ad reads. And, looking to cash-in on the online phenomenon that has become ASMR videos, Michelob also aired a second ad featuring actress Zoe Kravtiz. As with the viral videos, the commercial features her talking in a hushed voice accompanied by delicate sounds that advocates say can produce \u0027brain orgasms\u0027.THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUEThe National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl commercial featuring past and current legends is winning near-unanimous applause.The two-minute ad, which was directed by acclaimed Hollywood filmmaker Peter Berg, includes cameos by a number of the game\u0027s greats, including Peyton Manning, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, and others.  The commercial featured more than 50 active and retired players. It was created to celebrate the NFL\u0027s centennial season, which begins later this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. BURGER KINGBurger King may have won the contest for the edgiest and most original Super Bowl commercial idea on Sunday thanks to its ad featuring Andy Warhol chowing down on a Whopper.The fast food chain\u0027s 45-second spot features Warhol, the artist credited for spearheading the pop art movement of the 1960s, quietly feasting on a burger.Warhol doesn\u0027t make any noise except to briefly express frustration because the ketchup won\u0027t quickly emerge from the Heinz bottle.\u0027It doesn\u0027t come out,\u0027 Warhol says in the clip. PAMPERS   Adam Levine has joined John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen to remix Legend\u0027s Stinky Booty Duty song in a new Pampers Super Bowl commercial.The original Stinky Booty Duty song debuted last June, with Legend singing to his young daughter Luna while changing her diaper as other dads chimed in.The remix, dubbed Stinky Booty Duty 2.0, features Legend, 40, changing his eight-month-old son Miles\u0027 diaper, getting an assist from Luna and some vocal help from several other dads, including Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine.When Legend takes off Miles\u0027 diaper, he says he\u0027s gonna need some \u0027back-up on this one,\u0027 as Luna peels off some Pampers wipes, before turning to a group of random dads who have their kids strapped to them in baby carriers. Apparently all these dads can hold a tune and harmonize as well, as they start singing the Stinky Booty Duty song, with a surprise appearance from Levine towards the end. HULU - HANDMAID\u0027S TALE  The streaming service pulled perhaps the best bait-and-switch of any Super Bowl ad by starting off their slot with star Elizabeth Moss looking hopefully out of a window as the opening lines of Ronald Reagan\u0027s \u0027Morning in America\u0027 speech are read.But things turn dark fast as scenes from the dystopian TV series are spliced over the top of the President\u0027s stirring speech, before Moss takes over for the last line, saying: \u0027Wake up, America. Morning\u0027s over.\u0027MICROSOFT Microsoft\u0027s tear-jerker of an ad showed off its specially-adapted gaming controller, which allows a disabled child to play video games with his friends.But there was a larger message at play: namely the things that technology can do for people, both in terms of making their lives easier and bringing them together.GOOGLE The tech giant aired two adverts during the game, the first of which focused on how its search engine can be used to put veterans back to work.The second ad promoted its Google Translate service and pointed out that although \u0027words can hurt and sometimes ide,\u0027 the most translated words in the world are \u0027How are you,\u0027 \u0027Thank you\u0027, and \u0027I love you.\u0027Kim Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia, said the ad was an example of how the night\u0027s \u0027most powerful ads focused on unity, positivity and commonality.\u0027MINT MOBILE The wireless provider was trying to stand out from larger rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. But the \u0027gross-out\u0027 route may not have been the way to do it.The ad compares Mint Mobile\u0027s $20-a-month wireless plan with \u0027chunky milk,\u0027 then it shows a fake ad with a family drinking the unappetizing beverage. A mint-colored cartoon fox says the milk is \u0027not right,\u0027 but Mint Mobile\u0027s plan \u0027is right.\u0027TURKISH AIRLINES Turkish Airlines created a trailer for a six-minute short directed by Ridley Scott, known for directing Apple\u0027s iconic 1984 ad. It was the storied director\u0027s first return to the Super Bowl in decades. But some viewers took to Twitter to express confusion over what exactly the ad was trying to promote.CBS - TWILIGHT  ZONEAnother highly-convincing bait-and-switch advert, it appeared to show the game had restarted in Atlanta before cutting to an empty stadium with Jordan Peele standing in the middle.\u0027Witness an empty space, filled with thousands of screaming people,\u0027 Peele says in calming Twilight Zone toned voice.He adds: \u0027A man both nowhere and everywhere at the same time,\u0027 as he sits in several different seats, and stands on the field, all at the same time.\u0027Answers are new questions,\u0027 he reads on to a shot of the familiar Twilight Zone spiral tunnel. \u0027The unthinkable is the expected.\u0027He concludes with: \u0027When truth is not the truth, what dimensions are you even in?\u0027TURBOTAX The sinister nature of artificial intelligence featured heavily in Super Bowl ads, perhaps exemplified best by Turbotax\u0027s robo-child who yearns to do taxes.SIMPLISAFE Simplisafe also produced a fear-laden advert for its Super Bowl slot, playing on anxieties ranging from the news, to other humans and AI once again.The message: Simplisafe can protect you from everything nasty in the world outside, which happens to be everything in the world outside. SPRINTSprint\u0027s robots were some of the few to feature in Super Bowl ads without sinister overtones, helping to come up with a bizarre concept for a commercial that features Bo Jackson, holding a mermaid, playing a keytar, next to a bird-horse.Instead, Bo suggests they should just keep it simple by pointing out that Sprint can save people a lot of money when it comes to their phones.PRINGLES Pringles also went down the AI route, with two men stacking up the chips in different flavor combinations before wondering aloud how many combinations there are.A smart microphone then pipes up from the corner to answer the question, before going off on a tangent about how she will never taste any of them. She says: \u0027I have no hands to stack with, no mouth to taste with, no soul to feel with, I am at the mercy of a cruel and uncaring...\u0027 \u0027Cool, play Funky Town,\u0027 one of the men cuts in.WIX.COM Relying on star power to get their message across, website building service Wix brought in Karlie Kloss for their slot.The commercial shows the model updating her website with new photos while connecting to the likes of Google to make sure her site can be found by browsers.WASHINGTON POST Despite researching showing the Super Bowl viewers feel the game is a bad place to make a political point, the Washington Post went in hard with their ad, entitled \u0027knowing keeps us free\u0027.Narrated by Tom Hanks, it recaps moments in American history that were encapsulated by news coverage, before recapping three prominent journalists killed while reporting - including the Post\u0027s own Jamal Khashoggi.It ends with the mantra: \u0027Knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.\u0027AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO One of the more bizarre adverts to grace screens on Sunday night - it featured humans competing in a dog show for a prize of avocados.A contestant was showing rolling over - his 401k - while another woman ended up wearing a cone of shame after breaking ranks and running towards a table covered in guacamole.VERIZON Verizon chose to honor first responders in its Super Bowl advert, which also featured LA Chargers coach Anthony Lynn.Lynn recounts how he was badly injured in a 2005 car crash to a group of emergency workers, saying: \u0027I promise you I wouldn\u0027t be here today if it wasn\u0027t for the first responders.\u0027Then, in a tear-jerker moment, members of the crowd step forward to reveal they helped to save his life.T-MOBILE T-Mobile spent big on the Super Bowl, airing one advert per quarter, though none of them were especially memorable.Instead, the network used the expensive slots to announce a series of giveaways for customers, including free Lyft rides and free Taco Bell.AVENGERS: ENDGAMEMarvel Studios debuted a new 60-second trailer for the highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame during the Super Bowl LIII telecast.The highly-anticipated superhero adventure will bring Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a close, and is set in the aftermath of the devastating events of 2018\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War.COLGATE Luke Wilson made a celebrity cameo for this advert where he plays a \u0027close talker\u0027 - harkening back to an old Seinfeld episode.Wilson is firmly of the opinion that - thanks to Colgate\u0027s cleaning power - there is no such thing as talking \u0027too close\u0027 to somebody.\u0027Yes, there is,\u0027 an irritated mail man informs him.CAPTAIN MARVEL Marvel Studios debuted a new 30-second trailer for Captain Marvel during Super Bowl LIII, which showcases how this movie will take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u0027higher, further, faster.\u0027Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who, after a mysterious explosion with Kree technology, is imbued with incredible powers, which are on full display in the new trailer.WONDER PARKParamount\u0027s all-star animated film - based on a theme park ride - makes its pitch for Easter family movie in this trailer.Featuring the vocal talents of Kenan Thompson, Jennifer Garner, Mila Kunis, Matthew Broderick and John Oliver, it imagines what would happen if a child\u0027s dream theme park became a reality.WALMARTWalmart relied on an entirely different kind of star power for its ad, which featured famous vehicles instead of famous faces.Transformer\u0027s Bumblebee, Back to the Future\u0027s Delorean, and Ecto-1 from the original Ghostbusters are among a dozen vehicles to feature in the spot.RAM  Having been blasted for using a Martin Luther King speech to sell trucks back in 2018, this year sees RAM in a pensive mood - reflecting on the adverts of yesteryear.Two cowboys packing up their harnesses discuss what happened in all of the ads, though neither of them can remember what product they were selling.\u0027They just need to show you what they\u0027re selling,\u0027 one of them says, before climbing into his truck and starting the engine. MERCEDESAnother brand to air two spots during the game, Mercedes\u0027 first featured Ludacris who went to the Ron Clark Academy to surprise students.The surprises didn\u0027t stop there, however, as he handed out two tickets to the Super Bowl to two lucky pupils.The car brand\u0027s second slot features a man bending the world to his will using only the power of his voice - from finding cats to rescuing people trapped in an elevator, and giving away thousands of dollars.\u0027If only everything listened to you like a new A-Class,\u0027 the ad finishes.AMAZON PRIME - HANNAOriginally an oddball thriller film by Atonement director Joe Wright and starring Cate Blanchett, Amazon has taken the concept and turned it into a series.Fan will be able to watch the first episode online for 24 hours after the game ends. TOYOTA The car maker sets out to \u0027shatter perceptions\u0027 in this ad, featuring Toni Harris - the woman who wants to become the first to play in the NFL.Recapping Harris\u0027s incredible journey, including all the things she was told she could never be, Toyota says it has \u0027never been a fan of perceptions\u0027 before introducing its new RAV-4 Hybrid.HOBBS AND SHAW The latest trailer for the Fast and Furious spin-off which will feature Dwayne \u0027The Rock\u0027 Johnson and Jason Statham reprising their roles as lawman Luke Hobbs and lawless outcast Deckard Shaw. The pair face off against \u0027bad guy\u0027 Brixton - played by Idris Elba - who has gained control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever.It is left to Hattie Shaw - Deckard\u0027s sister, played by Vanessa Kirby - to bring ther brother and his sworn enemy together to bring down Brixton. NETFLIX - OUR PLANET Having dominated the true crime market with  Making A Murderer, the streaming giant\u0027s latest foray into the world of documentaries sees them turn to nature.This looks set to be another winner, since Netflix has teamed up with veteran documentary-maker David Attenborough for the series.KIA When you cannot be known for who you are, you must make yourself know for what you do - at least according to the car company\u0027s Super Bowl advert.Honoring the \u0027great unknowns\u0027 in America, it uses its small-brand name to its advantage in this touching ad, which stands up alongside the likes of Mercedes and Toyota, who also aired commercials during the game.YELLOW TAIL Panned as one of the game\u0027s most boring adverts, the Yellow Tail spot featured fan-made videos which fit with its slogan \u0027tastes like happy\u0027.Explaining what he likes about the ad, Adrien Colon - director of a San Francisco-based marketing platform who features in the commercial in a bahama hat - said: \u0027The mood is right, and the tone is right. \u0027It\u0027s mixed with different emotions, and moments where I chuckle and smile. It\u0027s about joy, and we can all relate.\u0027DEVOUR FROZEN FOODS Created by the same ad firm behind the Budweiser and Burger King ads, this one features a couple suffering through the effects of \u0027food porn\u0027 addiction.While the man gets his fix of frozen foods however and whenever he can, his partner tries and fails to tempt him away with home-made delights - to no avail.Some found it funny, others found it gross - but the \u0027dirty\u0027 version is currently the second-most-watched of any Super Bowl commercial online, after Budweiser.AUDIA bizarre advert featuring a dream-scape in which a man is given Audi\u0027s new electric car by his presumably deceased grandfather, this had a lot of viewers scratching their heads.Of course, it turns out the vision is not real and conjured up as a man chokes on a cashew, before he is \u0027saved\u0027 by a co-worker and plunges back into reality.The car, however, is real - as is the fact that Audi is going electric, with a third of all models to be electric powered by 2025.SKITTLESAnother of the Super Bowl\u0027s odder moments saw Skittles create not just an advert, but a full-blown 30 minute musical - part of which aired during the game.Starring Dexter’s Michael C Hall, it shows him changing his mind about creating a musical after eating Skittles gives him the confidence to press ahead with the idea.BON \u0026amp VIV SELTZERFeaturing two mermaids named Bon and Viv, who inform the viewer about their seltzer spiked with alcohol, assuring them that \u0027the myth is real\u0027.In fact, the pair are actually talking to a row of literal sharks - referencing the show Shark Tank - which is revealed as the camera pans back.The predators then begin arguing over who\u0027s buying the product as the ad ends. "},{"url":null,"title":"Patriots Tom Brady seeks sixth Super Bowl title win Rams","story":"    While holding his daughter Vivian, Tom Brady shares a kiss with his wife Gisele Bundchen after the Super Bowl win   Tom Brady\u0027s daughter Vivian Lake gets her hands on the Patriots\u0027 sixth Lombardi Trophy (left) while Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman celebrates the 13-3 Super Bowl LIII win over the Rams with his daughter Lily (right)           Brady hugs his mother Galynn after the Patriots\u0027 win.

Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams. His 29-yard catch in the fourth quarter helped to set up Sony Michel\u0027s 2-yard rushing touchdown, which put New England ahead for good.The nine-year veteran tight end credited Tom Brady with putting the ball in a perfect spot.\u0027On that play, we saw that there was a matchup right there,\u0027 Gronkowski said. \u0027There was a linebacker on me, and that\u0027s when I knew the ball was going to come to me. I knew Tom was going to throw it up there and (I could) just run up and make the play. It was a crucial play, and Sony just did the job finishing it off with a touchdown, which was awesome.\u0027Gronkowski was willing to clarify one question about his future: Yes, he planned to party Sunday night and beyond.\u0027Bill (Belichick) said he\u0027s partying tonight, and I ain\u0027t going to let him out-party me,\u0027 Gronkowski said with a grin.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass.

He actually came to the US from the UK as a teen and overstayed his visa\u0027.He added: \u0027In addition to being in violation of federal immigration law, Mr Abraham-Joseph was convicted on felony drug charges in October 2014 in Fulton County, Georgia\u0027. 21 Savage, who previously dated model Amber Rose, was arrested Sunday morning  in the Atlanta area. Mr Cox said the hip hop star is currently in ICE custody in Georgia and \u0027has been placed into removal proceedings before the federal immigration courts.\u0027 An  immigration judge will determine future actions. He has made millions after a string of number one albums and famously collaborated on the hit Sneakin\u0027 with his friend Drake, who recently bought him a Ferrari to say thanks.Abraham-Joseph took the name 21 Savage after getting shot six times on his 21st birthday and has had various run-ins with police before his arrest for immigration offences. He last performed in Atlanta on Thursday January 31 at the Super Bowl Music Fest at the State Farm Arena alongside Ludacris.

When the government finally ordered it to do this two years ago it became clear why. The BBC’s case for keeping the licence fee is based on the assertion that it is a public service broadcaster, producing output which no commercial broadcaster would bother with.But in that case, why is it competing with the commercial sector by offering fat salaries? These were the highest-paid employees last year – and they don’t even include those employed on a freelance basis through ‘personal service’ companies.The BBC has also been accused of seeking to hide salaries through a commercial offshoot called BBC Studios. Claudia Winkleman, for example, was paid between £375,000 and £379,999 last year for her Radio 2 show but is thought to earn up to £120,000 more for her appearances on Strictly.Gary Lineker: £1.75 - £1.76mChris Evans: £1.66- £1.67mGraham Norton: £600K - £609KSteve Wright: £550K - £559KHuw Edwards: £520K - £529KJeremy Vine: £ 440K - £449KNicky Campbell: £410K - £419KAlan Shearer: £410K - £419KJohn Humphrys: £400K - £409KNick Grimshaw: £400K - £409KManagement fatcatsThe publication of presenters’ salaries has taken attention away from the high salaries of BBC executives – nine of whom earn more than twice Theresa May’s salary as Prime Minister:Tony Hall, Director-General- £450KAnne Bulford, Deputy Director General - £435KCharlotte Moore, Director, Content - £370KFrancesca Unsworth, Director News and Current Affairs - £340KGlyn Isherwood, Group Finance and Operations Director - £325KKen MacQuarrie, Director Nations and Regions - £325KJames Purnell, Director, Radio and Education - £315KValarie Hughes-D’Aeth Group HR Director - £310KMatthew Postgate Chief Technical and Product Officer - £310K          Director-General of the BBC Tony Hall. Nine BBC executives earn more than twice Theresa May’s salary as Prime MinisterOffice refurbishmentThe BBC has a programme, Cowboy Trap, which features the experiences of homeowners driven to distraction by rotten and overcharging builders. How ironic, then, that when the BBC struggles with its own building projects. In 2010 the National Audit Office was scathing about the project to refurbish and extend Broadcasting House in Central London. The project, ended up costing £1.05billion, which, taking into account the cost of delays, was £107million more than originally projected.The BBC admitted to ‘serious mistakes’ which had cost the licence fee-payer dearlyMove to SalfordThe name of the development in which the BBC’s new studios in Salford are based – MediaCityUK – speaks of an attempt to make Manchester the new broadcasting capital of Britain. But that isn’t how many of 850 staff relocated there saw it.          The name of the development in which the BBC’s new studios in Salford are based – MediaCityUK (pictured) – speaks of an attempt to make Manchester the new broadcasting capital of BritainThe BBC ended up bribing them with astonishing relocation payments. The staff were each paid relocation expenses averaging £28,000, while 11 were given payments of more than £100,000 and one was paid £150,000. In some cases staff were paid to rent a property in Greater Manchester and commute back to their homes in London.In a report in 2013 the Public Accounts Committee was scathing of the excessive level of the payments – and of the BBC’s decision to take out a ten-year lease on studios which technology might have made redundant well before then.Mark Byford Pay-offIs there any organisation which can fritter money so freely when it is trying to save it? Mark Byford, who was Deputy Director General between 2004 and 2011 was made redundant in a drive to save money by axing senior jobs.But his pay-off was as much as some people earn in their entire careers. He was paid a year’s salary of £474,500, another £474,500 ‘in lieu of notice’ – and even £73,000 for holidays he hadn’t taken since he took up the job. In all he received £949,000. In axing 150 posts the BBC managed to spend a total of £25million in exit packages.Local news websitesIn 2008 Ofcom had to stop the BBC spending £68million on expanding local news websites and ‘hyper-local’ news. The BBC couldn’t even see what was wrong in using licence fee-payers money on a project which would inevitably undermine local newspapers, which were already struggling thanks to declining advertising.EastEnders extravaganzaThe audience of the BBC’s soap has tumbled from 1987 heyday of 21.1million to an average of 6.68million in 2017. But that hasn’t stopped the BBC throwing money at a new set – which it says is needed in order to film the programme in high-definition. The new set, at Elstree in Hertfordshire, was supposed to cost £57million and be ready by 2018. But, according to a report by the National Audit Office last autumn, it will end up costing £86.7million – enough to build approximately 1000 new social housing homes – and won’t be ready until 2021.          According to a report by the National Audit Office last autumn, the new EastEnders set will end up costing £86.7millionAir faresThe BBC is constantly bleating that it will have to cut popular programmes if it is forced to make economies. A more efficient way of cutting costs would be to stop pay such extravagant sums for air travel.Last year, BBC accounts revealed, the BBC’s chief technical and product officer Matthew Postgate took a return flight to Miami for an extraordinary £6,880. The accounts don’t say which airline or class of ticket he had, but according to air discount website Skyscanner you could fly direct from Heathrow to Miami next Monday, returning on the Friday, for £749 with FinnAir. Two executives were flown to New York for over-the-odds fares exceeding £2,000 return. Does the BBC bother to shop around when flying its executives around the world?TaxisIt is a similar story with taxis. In the three years to 2014, a Freedom of Information request revealed, the BBC spent £34million on taxi fares. In 2014 alone it spent £12million – £24,401 of which was for cancelled bookings. As with air fares, the BBC doesn’t seem to be good at shopping around. According to an item in the BBC’s staff magazine, Ariel, in 2014 an employee used the BBC’s taxi booking system and was quoted £87 for a trip from Tonbridge to Gatwick Airport. He then rang around local firms and was quoted an average of just £45. Ironically, the BBC’s taxi-booking system came with the strapline ‘more money for programmes’ – claiming it was saving money rather than wasting it.GlastonburyIn 2017, the year Glasto turned into a political rally for Jeremy Corbyn, the BBC refused to say how many people it had sent, nor how much it had spent on coverage, but in 2009 it did admit to sending 415 staff to cover the event. It is hardly as if Glastonbury is a great national event watched by the masses like, say, the cup final. In 2016, for example, its peak audience was 1.8million for Lionel Ritchie’s performance.          In 2009 the BBC did admit to sending 415 staff to cover Glastonbury festival Digital Media ProjectIn 2008 the BBC started developing a new digital platform to help producers share and edit video – which according to former Director General Mark Thompson was ‘essential’ for the BBC’s move to Salford. Five years later it scrapped the whole project, after wasting £98 million – having realised it could use off-the-shelf technology for far less money. Mr Thompson’s successor, Tony Hall, admitted to ‘serious concerns’ at how the project was handled.   Storm as over 75s face losing perk - meaning 4.5million households could be forced to payThe BBC yesterday faced a storm over the future of free TV licences for the over-75s amid rising fears that they will be abolished altogether.The broadcaster is expected to strip millions of pensioners of the perk after it signed up to an ‘unaffordable’ deal with the Government to cover the cost itself.Yesterday, former BBC boss Greg Dyke urged the corporation to ‘bite the bullet’ and scrap the benefit for the vast majority of over-75s and only award it to the very poorest households.But Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, pleaded with the Corporation to keep the perk in place so it does not have to drag ‘frail, housebound, elderly’ pensioners to court.          Yesterday, former BBC boss Greg Dyke urged the corporation to ‘bite the bullet’ and scrap the benefit for the vast majority of over 75sHe also said the BBC should not have to foot the bill for a mistake by the Government.More than 4.46million homes with older residents get a free licence, saving them £150.50 a year.The BBC struck a deal with the Government in 2015 to shoulder the cost of the free licences, previously paid for by the Department for Work and Pensions.The total bill stood at £655million last year but is expected to spiral to more than £1billion by 2029 – around a fifth of the BBC’s current budget. In exchange for this sum, the BBC was allowed to raise the fee in line with inflation – and to close the so-called ‘iPlayer loophole’ and force viewers to have a licence even if they only watch the BBC on catch-up services.The Government also agreed that the BBC could do away with free TV licences for the over-75s or change the rules so that fewer pensioners are eligible.Well-placed sources have told the Daily Mail that the Government was ‘astonished’ that the BBC ever accepted their demands.The Treasury asked BBC bosses to sign up to the deal as an opening gambit in talks over renewing the Corporation’s charter, and had a list of alternative proposals up their sleeve if it was refused.They expected BBC director general Lord Tony Hall and the then-BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead to threaten to resign over the proposal. But the BBC surprised Treasury bosses by agreeing to take on the cost, sources said.Yesterday Mr Dyke, who was BBC director general from 2000 to 2004, said the broadcaster’s bosses had faced a ‘difficult’ decision but ‘brought trouble for themselves’ by agreeing to Government demands. He said: ‘They accepted a short-term fix and gave themselves a long-term problem. They also face a very difficult decision now. If I were them I would bite the bullet and get rid of it.’Mr Dyke added that society ‘cossets’ old people and that it is no longer true that they are ‘necessarily’ the poorest section of society.The BBC has launched a public consultation on free TV licences for the elderly. The consultation, which closes next week, also asks whether the BBC should raise the entitlement age from 75 to 80, or give the over-75s a 50 per cent discount, or means-test the benefit.Yesterday, Jo Stevens, a Labour member of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said it was ‘unaffordable’ for the BBC to keep the free licences in place and simply swallow the cost.‘This could be a fifth of the BBC’s budget – the equivalent to what is spent today on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, CBBC and CBeebies,’ she said.Mr Brown said: ‘We have to ask whether, after 20 years of free licences, the BBC can justify taking a frail, housebound, elderly pensioner to court for not possessing a TV licence that for years she has had for free.’At the time of the agreement for the BBC to fund the over-75s licences, Lord Hall hailed it as a ‘strong deal’ that gave the Corporation ‘financial stability’.‘The Government’s decision here to put the cost of the over-75s on us has been more than matched by the deal coming back for the BBC,’ he said in 2015.Last night one of those who helped the BBC resist the Government’s proposal in 2010 said Lord Hall accepted the deal too easily.The source said: ‘They basically traded it for a cost-of-living increase in the licence fee and now they are having to live with the consequences of that.‘The BBC for a long time had bred a certain cockiness in its director generals, who if they were mere mortals would be a bit more cautious about what they agreed to sign up to.’BBC insiders said it was ‘rubbish’ that the Treasury had been surprised when Lord Hall accepted the deal. They also denied lobbying ministers to revisit the decision.A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have set out a range of options in our consultation – each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people.’"},{"url":null,"title":"X men star Fan Bingbing returns social media Instagram selfies wish fans Happy New Year","story":"Fan Bingbing wished her fans a Happy New Year on Instagram today - the day before the biggest day in the Chinese calendar.           The highest paid actress in China returned to social media to the delight of her fans with a message for New Year          Fan Bingbing, the highest paid actress in China, recently avoided the spotlight after she was told to pay back millions in taxesThe post is Fan\u0027s first since May.

They posted the logo side-by-side for an easy comparison.Others looked to even more mundane objects and noted their shower drain was extremely similar to the new design.But penises also seemed to be one of the main topics of interest. One critic even merged sex with ducks and asked Slack publicly on Twitter if the new logo was an fact a duck orgy.\u0027A friend told me that the new Slack logo looks like a swastika made of d**ks and now I can\u0027t unsee it.\u0027 said another.\u0027#Slack brands should never launch a logo. It never goes well. Particularly if it fails the two big questions every designer should ask before a logo leaves the room. 1) Could it look like a penis? 2) Could it look like a swastica?

Seed is the last outstanding suspect.  Philip Evans, QC, prosecuting, told Woolwich Crown Court: \u0027A total of 1015 items of jewellery, gold, watches, and bundles precious or semi-precious stones were recovered at the property, all of it in Mr Seed\u0027s bedroom with the exception of a deconstructed eternity ring.Hatton Garden \u0027suspect known as Basil who teamed up with...\u0027All she ever wanted was to be a mum and now she\u0027s lost...Share this article\u0027There were 43 victims of the Hatton Garden burglary. The police requested that they attend the police station in order to view the items seized and identify whether or not the itemsbundles recovered belonged to them.\u0027Only 30 victims responded and 22 attended the police station.\u0027789 of those items were positively identified by owners of safety deposit boxes as having been stolen from their boxes during the Hatton Garden burglary.\u0027A further 144 of those items were identified by owners of safety deposit boxes as being consistent with items that had been stolen from their boxes during the Hatton Garden burglary.\u0027Therefore, a total of 92 per cent of the items were, or potentially were, items stolen from safety deposit boxes during the Hatton Garden Burglary. 82 items remain unidentified.\u0027The items have been valued at £143,129,74 by Wilsons Auctioneers. This is the price the bundles would be expected to achieve at auction.          Michael Seed, believed to be Basil (court sketch pictured) is on trial for his alleged involvement in the Hatton Garden burglary, which became the biggest jewellery heist ever to be pulled off when it happened over the Easter weekend in 2015\u0027The wholesale value of the items has not been calculated, but it would be less.\u0027The majority of the jewellery was sealed in self-seal bags but also in Tupperware boxes, found both on the work bench and also in a wardrobe. \u0027Some jewellery was still intact, and a fair quantity displayed price tags and references.\u0027There was also some jewellery found in the wardrobe that appears to have been deconstructed ready for smelting the metal.A total of 835 Euros in cash was found in suit jacket pocket in the bedroom wardrobe, along with 35 Euros found along with money bands in a box on a shelf.\u0027The money bands are of the type that are used to hold bundles of denominations together.\u0027There were a number of tools such as pliers, precision drills, tweezers, soldering irons, and a smelting pot found capable of being used to deconstruct jewellery in order to separate precious stones from yellow and silver metals.            Chatila made the jewellery for Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding to her film star husband George\u0027Inside the front room was an amount of shelving containing large number of books about electronics and surveillance.\u0027That included in-depth and technical information in the area of electronics and radio frequencies as well as several manuals on anti-surveillance and anti-intrusive audio techniques.\u0027There were also products and devices found that do not appear to have been purchased in their current form, but rather have been built or adapted to meet specific requirements.\u0027There were devices that can covertly monitor movements and sounds by way of audio and vibration recordings. These products were found both in the front room and the bedroom.\u0027The Crown allege that the electronic devices found demonstrate that Mr Seed\u0027s role during the Hatton Garden burglary was a crucial one: the disabling of the security system, as was mentioned by the other conspirators in the covert recordings.\u0027Combined with the manner in which the items were ided up, this further points towards Seed\u0027s leading role in the conspiracy.\u0027Clothing was found in the bedroom for which Mr Seed would have no legitimate use but could be used to gain illegitimate access to premises, for example for reconnaissance purposes: a \u0027BT\u0027 Hi-Vis jacket, a \u0027Royal Mail\u0027 Hi-Viz jacket and a \u0027BT Open Reach\u0027 Blue T-Shirt.\u0027In the front room there are a large number of very high-level knowledge-based books on various electronic devices.\u0027In addition, there are a number of books in relation to anti-surveillance techniques including one that instructs the reader on how to defeat audio devices.\u0027          The burglars spent the evening of April 2 2015 drilling three holes (pictured) so they could get into the vault at the Hatton Garden jewellery shop, the jury heard Jurors also heard a glove discovered at the scene of the Chatila burglary links Seed to the raid.Me Evans said: \u0027Following Mr Seed\u0027s arrest on 27 March 2018 in respect of the offence at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, his DNA was compared to the samples retained from the offence at Chatila.\u0027You\u0027ll remember there was a glove found in the electrical alarm cupboard at Chatila. \u0027That glove had a mixture of DNA from at least four people inside it and the majority profile was a partial match for Danny Jones, 61 (already convicted for his part in the raid).\u0027The chances of it coming from someone other than Jones was one in a billion and you\u0027ll remember that Jones pleaded guilty to taking part in this burglary.\u0027Among the DNA remaining it was discovered that Mr Seed\u0027s DNA profile was almost completely represented within it as well.\u0027The re-testing of the glove in 2018 used a more advanced method DNA LiRa. That method tested two propositions against each other: The DNA came from Jones, Seed, and two others The DNA came from Jones and three other people all of whom were unrelated to Seed.\u0027It was concluded that it was 6,600 times more likely that the first proposition was true - namely that the DNA inside the glove was obtained from Jones, Seed and two other people.\u0027The similarities between the burglary at Chatila and the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit are striking and compelling. \u0027The Crown says that those similarities are explained not by coincidence but because the same people were involved in both.\u0027Jurors were shown CCTV of the man alleged to be Seed entering the premises at 9.20pm that evening.  The prosecution claims that once inside the gang disabled the lift and lowered themselves down the shaft to the basement.The lock on the door was then snapped off leaving a hole to get in and out of the vault.They damaged the alarm by cutting the telephone wires and the GPS aerial was deactivated.But the damaged alarm sent a message to security when the outer gate of the vault was opened shortly after midnight, the court heard. Mr Evans said: \u0027A director of Hatton Garden Safety Deposit received a call from the monitoring company almost immediately.\u0027He was told that the alarm was signalling and that the police were on scene. \u0027The latter part of the message was wrong: the police did not come until later.          He is accused of being part of a gang which raided Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in 2015\u0027The director arranged for one of the security guards to attend the scene and he decided to go himself as well. \u0027At about 01:15 the security guard arrived at Hatton Garden. He inspected the exterior of the premises only. \u0027He called the director, who was by then five minutes away, and he called him to say that the main door and the fire exit appeared secure.\u0027He informed him, wrongly, that it was a false alarm, and both men returned home. The attempts to access the vault continued inside.\u0027The men then spent the night cutting through the second sliding iron gate and then drilling three adjoining and circular holes in the thick wall to the vault.\u0027The prosecution claims Basil and Jones were the only ones who could have fitted into the vault. He added: \u0027It seems likely that Perkins - already jailed over the burglary - would have been unable to fit through the hole of that nature and so it would appear that Jones and \u0027Basil\u0027 were the ones who actually entered the vault itself.\u0027Once inside the vault, the burglars jemmied open 73 of the 999 safe deposit boxes, which they proceeded to ransack.\u0027No doubt, if they had had more time, and more people to assist them, they would have opened more, and stolen more.\u0027 The prosecution then claimed expert evidence proves Seed is Basil from the way the man in the CCTV footage walks.    Seed, of Islington, north London, is also accused of taking part in a \u0027strikingly similar\u0027 £1million raid on Amal Clooney\u0027s wedding jewellers, Chatila (pictured) in London\u0027s Mayfair during the August Bank Holiday weekend of 2010Mr Evans added: \u0027The expert noted the right leg movement and the position of the foot and lower limb have a similar appearance at various stages of the gait cycle in both sets of footage, consistent over time and repeatable and reliable characteristics.\u0027In other words, the different parts of the leg movements when the two iniduals walk - \u0027Basil\u0027 in the Hatton Garden footage and Seed after Hatton Garden - are consistent.\u0027It is the experts\u0027 opinion that there is strong evidence to support the proposition that Seed is Basil.\u0027Both sets of footage have also been reviewed by an expert ChiropodistPodiatrist.\u0027He concluded that the \u0027Basil\u0027 footage showed someone with a particular habitual gait - an abnormality in his right leg.\u0027 According to a covert recording of fellow gang members Daniel Jones, 61, and 78-year-old John Collins, Basil was the only one who knew enough about alarms to disable them.Jurors heard Jones tell Collins: \u0027I don\u0027t know enough to challenge him you know what I mean? Like say nah that ain\u0027t right... He can baffle me with b*******.\u0027Mr Evans also said: \u0027It appears that the burglars were highly forensically aware. No fingerprints or DNA traces were detectable on items left at the scene, or the walls and floor.\u0027Furthermore, a milky-white fluid, later determined to be bleach, had been sprayed on surfaces, indicating that a significant degree of cleaning, designed to prevent any evidence being left behind, had taken place.\u0027After the break-in \u0027a white-male\u0027 was seen speaking to Collins in parks near to Seed\u0027s home address who prosecutors claim is \u0027Basil\u0027. Mr Evans went on to describe Seed\u0027s alleged disguise: \u0027He has got some sort of hat on and some sort of wig.\u0027Basil can be seen with his face covered, with white gloves on and headphones in his ears, according to the prosecutor. The court heard the burglars used a Hilti DD350 drill they had brought with them to cut three holes.Mr Evans continued: \u0027They 25cm by 45cm breach in that wall.          Accused: Michael \u0027Basil\u0027 Seed, 58, of Islington, north London is on trial at Woolwich Crown Court\u0027They would at this point have encountered the back of the heavy metal cabinet housing the safe deposit boxes which was fixed both to the floor and ceiling.\u0027It appears that they had with them on that first night a Clarke pump and hose, which included a 10-ton hydraulic ram.\u0027For some reason, the burglary was not completed that night. It seems, from what happened in the following days, that there had been a problem with the pump and hose.\u0027What that problem was is not immediately clear, but it seems it did not do its job and stopped them from moving the metal cabinets, and ultimately stopped them getting through that hole, remember those metal cabinets were bolted to the floor and ceiling.\u0027Jurors were shown an exact model of the hole drilled into the vault at Hatton Garden which the raiders used to loot the safes inside.Seed denies two counts of conspiracy to burgle and one count of conspiracy to conceal or disguise criminal property.Earlier trials have seen the convictions of Danny Jones, 61, Terry Perkins, John Kenneth Collins, 78, \u0027Kenny\u0027, Carl Wood, 58, and Brian Reader, 79, in connection with the Hatton Garden job.Perkins, 69, died in prison ahead of his trial for involvement in the Chatila raid and Jones admitted his role in the heist last year.William Lincoln, 63, Hugh Doyle, 51, Terri Robinson, 37, and Bren Walters, 45, were also convicted for conspiring to conceal criminal property.Charles Matthews, 55, was convicted of handling stolen goods from the Chatila burglary.Seed\u0027s trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"Winds change Iconic RAF Tornado jets make final flight home 40 years","story":"    Magnificent Flying Machines: The RAF Tornado GR4, initially introduced in 1979 and first in service in 1982, has now been retired.

The Tornado can trace its DNA all the way back to work by Sir Barnes Wallis, better known for developing the ‘bouncing bomb’ used by 617 Sqn ‘The Dambusters’ in 1943, who began work on variable geometry (VG) wing designs in the 1950s. He realised with a VG aircraft’s wings swept forwards - spread wide - it could use shorter runways and display greater manoeuvrability, and by sweeping them back could achieve maximum high-speed performance.Although no planes were built from his designs, VG wings became commonly used on fighter aircraft through the latter half of the twentieth century, including on the Tornado.It was initially created by a British-German-Italian conglomerate, Panavia, which was set up in Germany to build the craft.The Tornado programme was initiated in 1968, and the first prototype flew on 14 August 1974. The initial RAF requirement was for 220 aircraft, and the first of these was delivered to RAF Cottesmore in July 1980, becoming the mainstay of the RAF strike force in June 1982. RAF Tornados took part in the 1999 Kosovo war and the GR4 upgrade was completed in time for Operation Telic, the UK\u0027s deployment in Iraq from 2003 to 2011. Tornados were used in Afghanistan from 2009 until the withdrawal of UK forces in 2014. According to the Ministry of Defence, they flew over 5,000 sorties and logged more than 33,500 flight hours during this time.           The sun sets on the Tornado: The powerful jets were conceived in the late 1960s, based on previous work by Sir Barnes Wallis of \u0027Dambusters\u0027 fame.  They flew for the first time in 1974 and entered service in 1979.

The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Ms Bower was told two calls were made from Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield, which Amber attended at the time of her death, to MASH before the tragedy – one in September 2014, and another six months later.Both times a worker took information from the callers – one of whom was a key worker at the school and the other its vice principal - and handed it on to a qualified social worker.But the inquest was told the case didn\u0027t pass a \u0027threshold\u0027 that would have triggered statutory social services intervention.On the second occasion the caller from the school was told to go back to Amber\u0027s parents and \u0027discuss\u0027 the claims she had made without any evidence the potential impact on her of doing so had been assessed – something Ms Bower said \u0027shocked\u0027 her.The coroner told MASH group manager Teresa Godfrey: \u0027In the world of safeguarding there should have been an explicit conversation about risk.\u0027The first call to the safeguarding unit was made by Queen Elizabeth vice principal Karen Green.But MASH officer Elizabeth Fisher, who took the call, said the information provided was \u0027limited\u0027 and \u0027without context\u0027 – and didn\u0027t satisfy the criteria for a full social services referral. Instead, the school was advised to carry out an \u0027Early Help\u0027 assessment – something it ultimately didn\u0027t do.However, Mrs Fisher did accept a suggestion from Ms Bower that she could have asked more questions and \u0027dug a little deeper\u0027 to gain a wider picture of the situation. She said evidence she had heard during the inquest about Amber while sat in the public gallery had left her \u0027shocked\u0027.A second call was made to the MASH team in March 2015, two months before Amber\u0027s death, by her school key worker Sharon Clay.She reported concerns over Amber wearing ill-fitting tracksuit bottoms to school, which the inquest has previously heard she was made to do by Mr Peat after failing to put her normal trousers in the wash, and bringing her items in a cheap plastic bag.Ms Clay added that she thought Amber was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 by her stepdad, who had also ordered her to wash the floors at 11.30pm at night.However, the concerns again weren\u0027t enough to merit the involvement of social services.MASH worker Joanna Shepherd, who took the call, said \u0027you would need more incidents over a period of time\u0027 – adding she was not aware at the time of the \u0027bigger picture\u0027 surrounding Amber.The inquest heard Mrs Shepherd had no knowledge of the earlier call. She told the hearing she could have asked for more details – but would have expected the caller to give a \u0027full picture\u0027.After getting the advice of a social worker, Mrs Shepherd told Ms Clay the school should go back and discuss the matter with Amber\u0027s mum.But Ms Bower asked if any thought had been given to the impact it could have on Amber if the disclosures she\u0027d made to her teacher were passed back to her parents, adding: \u0027As we discuss this now, do you see the concerns I am raising?\u0027Mrs Shepherd replied: \u0027Yes. But I could not question the social worker on that.\u0027The hearing was told that since Amber\u0027s death procedures had been put in place, including better recording systems, that aimed to gather and collate information better.The inquest continues.   If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article then you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, alternatively you can visit the website at by clicking here.    "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1431fe1e745750beba606a5021051efe95f0b08d/0_204_6855_4114/master/6855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbd20fbbb3be0d1e5f3aa5dc23315de","title":"don mccullin tate retrospective review","story":"Tate Britain, LondonThis retrospective of the veteran photographer’s images of war, poverty and atrocity shines light on the unconscionable. It’s almost overwhelmingHere is the camera that took a bullet instead of its owner. The military helmet and the light meter, passports and compass, all in a vitrine. Here is the American soldier, traumatised, staring back. Here are the villagers, displaced. Here are the living and here are the dead. Here are things I prefer not to describe.There are too many photographs in Don McCullin’s retrospective at Tate Britain. Room after room, on grey wall after grey wall, they keep on coming. These framed, mostly black and white images are a journey through the world and through the photographer’s life. Now 83, McCullin is a man who has seen too much and borne witness to too much. The too many and the too much are part of the point of this engrossing and demanding exhibition.“Yo lo vi” – I saw it – wrote Goya, beside an image of people fleeing before advancing French troops, in one of the prints in his Disasters of War suite of etchings, made around 200 years ago. “And this as well,” he wrote, beside the subsequent image. Goya’s declarations might not always tell the literal truth of what he saw with his own eyes, but no such doubts accompany McCullin’s photographs. He was there, as the Berlin Wall went up, on the streets of Limassol during the Cyprus civil war, in the Bogside and in Stanleyville, Biafra and Vietnam. He was there with the lone gunman, crouching alert on the floor of the wrecked lobby of the Holiday Inn in Beirut. He was there with the corpse of the Congolese man, his brains shot out beside his bicycle.He was also there when the woman, the very picture of a middle-class housewife, smiled back at his camera, as she was bundled away by the police at a Ban the Bomb protest at Aldermaston in the early 1960s. He also saw the homeless men asleep while standing, hands in pockets, heads lowered like horses, in Whitechapel in 1970. Disaster is so often close to home, in squalid rooms in Bradford, on East End doorsteps, in Toxteth and in Wigan.There are so many great and terrible images here. I snatch at fragments – the kid in the Finsbury park youth club, the gawping blokes with their beers in the stripper pub, the big northern woman queuing with a shiny new shovel in her hand, like the latest accessory. Small consolations and momentary pleasures, along with death and starvation, misery and fear, remind us of a different everyday. Fishermen kick a football about on a Scarborough beach, the sky about to open on a moment of sun. The metal mirror of a Somerset dew pond, round as a plate. A knobbly knees contest in Southend-on-Sea. Then we are back, staring at collapsed staircases, like exposed entrails, spilling from a bombed apartment block in Homs, Syria, and with a man dying of Aids in Zimbabwe.In these unrelenting scenes of trespass and tragedy we are left facing our own voyeurism, an increasing inability to process the mounting horrors. McCullin revisits his own work over and over again, as he prints and reprints his images in his darkroom, repeatedly trying to tease the best from his negatives. His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories. The words “negatives” and “processing” have rarely felt so freighted.Many of McCullin’s photographs demand a long, strong look. Others we might want to swerve away from almost at the moment of recognition, only needing to see them once. They are already fixed in the developing fluid of the subconscious. Many of us of a certain age will have first encountered McCullin’s photographs by chance through the 1960s and 70s, in the Observer, in the Sunday Times Magazine. Many have been stirring around in my head for most of my life, irreducible and unforgettable.McCullin’s images brought the Vietnam war, starvation in Biafra, civil wars, post-colonial and nearer-to-home sectarian conflicts in Derry and Belfast, into our houses and into our heads in a way that television coverage never could.Sometimes McCullin had to walk away. Sometimes I had to walk away from certain images, too. After a few rooms, I had to take a break from the grieving and the corpses, the starving and the terrified. Our hunger for images may be insatiable, but it becomes hard to concentrate and to give each image, taken at who knows what cost, its due.There is a visceral quality to McCullin’s photographs, in their analogue tonalities, the depth of their blacks and greys, the clarities and dimming of their whites, their strong and weak light, their focus, their attendance on the unconscionable. His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career. Conflict was always round the corner for McCullin, even growing up in low-ceilinged rooms and poverty in Finsbury Park. Down the road, a man shepherds a flock to an abattoir through a grim north London dawn.Where the homeless stood around reeking fires of rubbish in Spitalfields market half a century ago, they sleep in corporate doorways now. The wars continue. There is no end to the poverty, nor to the atrocities. Looking away is not an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde2cb81340b9388a68eafcf502ce9d41ae763e2/12_460_1022_613/master/1022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6974478ee1df9ad7b78e60b6134ec636","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“Jesus, that was a dark and disturbing slice of French noir,” says Tom Mooney, who has been reading The Executioner Weeps by Frederic Dard:Daniel, a French artist, is on a break near Barcelona. Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating. The mystery of how a 4-year-old girl ended up in the river and was rescued and where she came from are central and I can’t wait to find out.“I saw somewhere that 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first book in the Flashman series,” says RedmonT. “While I couldn’t care less about that, it did remind me how long it has been since I read them, so I’ve ed back in”:This morning, I finished the third in the series - Flash for Freedom - and am now about to start Flashman at the Charge. I think Royal Flash is by far the weakest of the series (though still brilliant) and Flashman and the Redskins the best. I urge you all to have a go at reading them if you haven’t already. As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?!

Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website. Le Sistrot in Quimper stocks a wide range of craft and farm ciders.There’s also a long tradition of beer brewing in the region. Brasserie Lancelot was founded in 1990 and occupies the site of a gold mine in Roc-Saint-André, Morbihan. Seven unpasteurised beers are made here, each one named after a figure from Breton history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eeb4d2c9265a66115f75f7f2eb30f3046c0eda0/0_24_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc582ffdd34e9633d41beea6f56c96a4","title":"hmv bought doug putman stores jobs","story":"Oxford Street flagship shut but 100 of chain’s 127 stores will survive under new owner• Doug Putman: the vinyl fan aiming to put a new spin on HMVHMV has been rescued from collapse by a Canadian music entrepreneur, but 27 stores in prime locations have closed, including the site of its first store on London’s Oxford Street.Doug Putman, who runs the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, has bought the UK music and film chain after emerging as the leading contender over the weekend, heading off competition from Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct.Under the deal, 100 HMV shops will remain open, protecting the jobs of nearly 1,500 workers across the stores and head office. However, the immediate closure of 27 stores will lead to 455 job losses. A further 122 warehouse jobs will go in the coming weeks.Closure of the flagship store on Oxford Street signals the end of HMV’s presence on London’s most famous shopping street after nearly a century. That first shop was opened in 1921 by Sir Edward Elgar, the British composer.HMV is also closing in other prime locations where rents are higher including the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Meadowhall in Sheffield, Westfield in White City, west London, and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.The retailer collapsed into administration just after Christmas, blaming tough conditions on UK high streets and competition from streaming sites such as Netflix and Spotify.Announcing the deal, Putman said: “We are delighted to acquire the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK and add nearly 1,500 employees to our growing team.”Putman said he would personally lead the turnaround over the coming months. He told the  he wanted to expand HMV and would be putting more vinyl records and more live music events into stores.He said he hoped to replicated Sunrise Records’ success in Canada, where he took over about 70 HMV store sites after the chain went bust there in early 2017. The business is now profitable and has more than 80 outlets after increasing sales every year.“I don’t know if there are people that love music more than in the UK but there isn’t a marketplace I would love more to be a part of. We’re very excited,” he said.The stores will continue to operate under the HMV brand, with four stores continuing to trade as Fopp outlets.Putman said he believed HMV would be around in the UK for a long time.“Talk about the demise of the physical business is sometimes a bit exaggerated, especially in music specialists. Most of the decline is coming from nontraditional sellers like the grocery chains. We’ll be here for quite some time.”Putman, 34, has been president of Sunrise Records since 2014 when it had just five stores. His company has been a beneficiary of the renewed popularity of vinyl: Sunrise sold almost 500,000 LPs in 2017.● The first HMV shop opened on London’s Oxford Street on 20 July 1921, the ribbons strung across the doors were cut by composer and conductor Sir Edward Elgar. The retailer moved its flagship store back to this original site, at 363 Oxford Street, in 2013.● The company was originally part of the Gramophone Company, founded by Emile Berliner, a German-born American inventor.● In 1931 the Gramophone Company merged with a rival to create Electric and Musical Industries (EMI). EMI’s now-famous recording studios at Abbey Road were also opened that year. The first A\u0026ampR managers to spot and develop music talent in Britain were appointed in 1940. Among them was George Martin, who signed the Beatles.● HMV stands for\u0026nbspHis Master’s Voice, the title of a painting by Francis Barraud of jack russell dog Nipper listening to a cylinder phonograph (which was updated to wind-up gramophone and eventually used as a simple silhouette).● Over the years many of the world’s greatest artists have appeared in HMV stores to meet fans or perform. They include Cliff Richard, Kate Bush, Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Madonna, David Bowie, Beyoncé, Amy Winehouse and more recently Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.● HMV was also a record label in its own right, with artists including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Elvis Presley and Morrissey. In 1967 EMI converted HMV into a classical-only music label.● In its first few decades HMV traded principally from the Oxford Street store, but spread across London in the 1950s and 60s. It did not become a national chain until the 1980s, when CDs made music retailing very profitable. It reached 100 stores in 1997, and grew to more than 200 by 2004.● HMV bought book retailer Dillons in 1995 and three years later added Waterstones. In 2011, following a slump in book sales, HMV sold Waterstones to Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut for £53m.● HMV floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, leaving EMI with only a token shareholding.● Following a collapse in sales and several profits warnings, HMV collapsed into administration in January 2013. US restructuring firm Hilco bought some of HMV’s assets out of administration and took HMV back to its original flagship.• HMV collapsed into administration again in December 2018, with Hilco blaming an “extremely weak” festive trading season and “a tsunami of challenges”. KPMG was appointed as administrator, with HMV attracting interest from both Canadian music store mogul Doug Putman and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe deal saves HMV from collapse for the second time in six years, after the restructuring firm Hilco bought the business in 2013. Hilco called in administrators from KMPG in December, blaming an “extremely weak” festive trading season and “a tsunami of challenges” for retailers.KPMG was tasked with either finding a buyer for the business or closing it down.Neil Gostelow, a partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: “We are grateful for the support of all key stakeholders including the suppliers whose support throughout this process has been key in securing this sale.”Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said HMV’s long-term future remained uncertain, despite the sale.“HMV survives to live another day. Its acquisition by Canadian group Sunrise will ensure the iconic British brand stays on the high street. Alas, one has to question whether it has a big opportunity under the new owner or whether it is still living on borrowed time,” he said.

It took a major blow in 2015 when Tesco closed its supermarket in the mall which doubled as the town’s post office. Now more than half of the shops that do have tenants are occupied by charitable ventures.Bidding started at £10 for the shopping centre, which cost £4.25m to build and opened in 1981.Duncan Moir, an auctioneer for Allsop which handled the sale, said there had been at least six bidders. Several interested parties present in the room at the Berkeley hotel in central London lost out to a bidder on the phone, understood to be an investor from the north of England.

A song more suited, perhaps, to the extraordinary spectacle that it has been putting on for the world since 23 June 2016?.Three years after the Brexit referendum we still haven’t even left the starting blocks. There’s no majority for a hard Brexit, no majority for a soft Brexit and none for remain ... And like the residents of the Hotel California, the European Union has no interest in helping the UK to win because that would send the wrong message to other tenants and thus threaten its very existence.In other words, there is absolutely no chance (contrary to what Theresa May seems to be hoping) that the UK’s 27 EU partners will renegotiate the withdrawal agreement reached last November. We can understand the hard Brexiters’ frustration with the famous backstop, but they can’t blame the EU for inventing the Irish problem: the absence of a physical border is a key element of the Good Friday agreement, which put an end to a conflict that was a legacy of England’s colonisation of Ireland. The EU, as guarantor of the peace agreement, cannot accept a deal that would amount to re-establishing a physical border between the two Irelands.Nor can it allow the UK to maintain its access to the EU single market without respecting its rules if there is an open border, since that would be tantamount to giving it all the rights and advantages of EU membership without having to accept any of the obligations. That would mark the beginning of the end of the EU since other countries could claim the same treatment, and nobody wants that: not the countries of eastern Europe, which fear the disappearance of the common EU budget, or the countries of the west, which have no desire to give a competitive advantage to a country that has one foot inside the EU and one foot out.True, a no-deal outcome would also result in the immediate restoration of a physical border between the two Irelands. But it would preserve the integrity of the EU and London would have to bear the political consequences of jeopardising the Good Friday agreement. Cynical? No, because the UK is solely responsible for this situation. The EU27 asked Britain two years ago to come up with a proposed solution, something it is still unable to do. The backstop is a stopgap that gives both sides time to conclude a trade agreement that would, and let’s be clear, force Britain to comply with almost all EU rules and regulations if it wants to keep the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland open and avoid creating a new frontier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Day after day, it appears that the Brexiters have absolutely failed to add up the price of leaving the EU or, worse, that they have deliberately concealed it from the people of Britain.Right now there is not even an agreement to extend the article 50 process beyond 29 March. That would require unanimity among the 27. Most of the other EU nations are tired of Britain’s shilly-shallying and no longer want to live their lives to the Brexit drumbeat. An extension is conceivable only if London proposes a real solution acceptable to all, a solution that would require a a bit more time. But we are a long way from there.The nightmare scenario for the EU would be a new UK referendum that would settle absolutely nothing. A remain win would just leave British politics haunted by the European question. Let’s not forget that the 1975 referendum, despite being won by the pro-European side failed to put the matter to bed. So, five, 10, perhaps 15 years from now there would be yet another referendum in Britain. Europe would find itself for years to come still held hostage by Britain’s never-ending internal debate on Europe. Much better for the UK to come out. And if it discovers in due course that Brexit has been a terrible mistake it can come back in, but this time without any of the opt-outs or special status it currently enjoys. Because, be in no doubt, if you’re staying at the Hotel California, you can never leave.• Jean Quatremer is Brussels correspondent of Libération and blogs at Coulisses de Bruxelles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05160bcc989f986e2990ea4d17496b1675450bd/0_105_4084_2450/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232829f6ae624063bd30345b02ec81fc","title":"civil servant no deal brexit operation yellowhammer","story":"Operation Yellowhammer from the inside? It’s like The Office meets The Poseidon Adventure, with a Benny Hill soundtrackI’m a civil servant working for a UK government department. We haven’t been directly convulsed by Brexit yet, but hundreds of us will soon be conscripted into the Brexit crisis thunderdome. Welcome to Operation Yellowhammer. This is basically an emergency plan that prepares the government for a no-deal Brexit. It is currently winkling thousands of officials from across Whitehall out of their day jobs to focus on helping Brexit-facing departments – Defra, the Department for International Trade and the Home Office – to cope with the havoc that will engulf them if the worst happens.Yellowhammer, eh? Who dreams up these Brexit crisis-limitation codenames? It’s probably a secret cry for help from some wizened Treasury or Cabinet Office official. That’s why Operation Brock, which tested no-deal readiness to keep the British freight industry moving, was supposed to sound like an army exercise to prepare British people to safely find, kill and cook badger.It’s been suggested that Operation Yellowhammer alludes to the call of the eponymous bird, whose call sounds like “a little bit of bread and no cheese”, and is therefore a handy precis of the UK’s post-Brexit food rationing policy. We should by now be in Yellowhammer’s final, perhaps terminal, stage. In my own department, virtually all of the several hundred likely to be Brextracted are still waiting to hear. We know that directors are working behind the scenes to identify these poor buggers. But the worrying fact is that most people don’t yet know when they’re going to be deployed, how long for, or what they’ll be working on when they are. Then there’s the question of whether they’ll actually be qualified to do whatever their new job is, given a) anyone who’s spent even five minutes in a trade negotiating room has already been rounded up like a prized Angus by DExEU and DIT’s HR departments , and b) even now, nobody knows what is going to happen.As reported by Civil Service World, around ten thousand civil servants are working on Brexit, with tens of millions of additional pounds being spent on consultancy fees. But 5,000 more civil servants will be needed, with the Institute for Government suggesting that even this won’t be nearly enough. You can’t help but wonder what could be achieved if this concentration of treasure and talent was lavished on other pressing national issues – education, housing, health, energy, climate change, the next series of The Bodyguard. We’ll never know, will we?So what will it look like when the Yellowhammer fuse is finally lit? We don’t know that either, but I suspect a screenwriter will one day pitch a mockumentary about this as The Office meets The Poseidon Adventure with a Benny Hill soundtrack. Not even Benedict Cumberbatch could save it.My theory is that Yellowhammer hasn’t really got going yet because the grey eminences in charge have calculated that the risk of being defenestrated for wasting billions on a no-deal Brexit that never happens is slightly higher than the risk of being overwhelmed by a no-deal.Meanwhile, coverage of the civil service’s orbit around the Brexit plughole has become more and more disquieting over the last couple of years, ranging from cautious realism to  despair. Missing from this has been any acknowledgement of the reality that civil servants are only as effective as the ministers they’re legally obliged to serve under. And under the current crop of ministers, with fewer than 60 days to go, the civil service’s morale and ability to deliver any sort of Brexit seems to be evaporating fast. With the clock ticking down, the stakes just keep getting higher.No-deal Brexit will be horrendously complex and time-consuming to implement, but the mess we are in is political and social, not technical. That’s why officials are haunted by what government ministers still can’t or won’t admit: that any Brexit is going to hurt the country, but a no-deal Brexit is going to rip our arms off, disrupting almost every aspect of British public life except the weather (and maybe even that too).According to some reports, some senior civil servants insist that Whitehall is more or less prepared for Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, but my experience of Yellowhammer, plus the almost daily torrent of stories about the stockpiling of food (which alone is a terrifyingly unpredictable scenario), ferries, lorry queues, immigration and other issues covered by 106 technical notices, suggests there are going to be one or two drones on the no-deal runway that we haven’t thought of yet.And what seems clear is that all Brexit outcomes will damage the UK civil service, both as a place to work and in terms of the faith that the public places in it. The death threat made against HMRC permanent secretary Jon Thompson sadly doesn’t seem to be a one-off – other high-profile civil servants have been targeted too.My hope is that, whatever outcome the parliamentary tombola eventually coughs up, ministers, the public and the press should resist the temptation to trash us, either for not sufficiently internalising the alchemy of Brexiteer logic, or for not sufficiently resisting it.Are there any circumstances under which we should resist orders to plan a no-deal Brexit even if we believe this to be a disastrous step? Absolutely not – in fact it’ll be us who are working hardest to make sure the lights stay on, long after Brexiteer MPs have scuttled off into comfortable obscurity. Besides, civil servants need to keep the trust of whichever government follows this one.I’m a bit of a cynic, but I still believe the UK’s public servants – yes, including some of the current crop of politicians – are among the most committed in the world, even if history is busily repeating the lesson that even top-notch administrations can sleepwalk into catastrophic shitshows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e092d31a2c74645be5a2cdec6cbbe7b6bc98d6a3/0_42_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d7a595671f35ac05d6ecfae8b33ce58","title":"mps social media twitter","story":"The platform claims the dignity of more politicians every day, but some will risk anything to show offIn the early 2000s politicians sometimes made the mistake of agreeing to be interviewed by Ali G, the spoof character played by Sacha Baron Cohen.

But Twitter is not there to help them. It is there to trip them up. First it lulls them into a false sense of security – rewarding chit chat about their pets or their constituency, welcoming them into an environment where other people (not MPs) are free to tweet unguarded thoughts and opinions – and then, at some unspecified but certain point, it brutally shames them in front of the whole world. Twitter has nothing to lose, and they do.In the last few days Twitter has claimed the dignity of no fewer than four conservative MPs. On Saturday the Shrewsbury MP Daniel Kawczynski tweeted that there was “no Marshall Plan for us only for Germany”, referring to the money given by the US to European countries after the second world war. As many people have pointed out to him since then, he is quite wrong – Britain received almost twice the amount Germany did. But not only did Twitter record his mistake, it also recorded his subsequent inability to deal with it: Kawczynski refused to correct himself, informed a number of his critics they needed to “get out more” and told off the former Newsnight presenter Gavin Esler for spelling his name wrong.On Sunday Mercer attacked the paper’s editor for publishing a critical piece about him, calling it “a whinge about fake news, from the biggest purveyor of fake news in Plymouth”. Mercer did not come out of it well, but I imagine the editor was delighted (after the October showdown, his news site started running pieces such as “This is why Plymouth Herald is trending on Twitter”). Mercer had everything to lose from the exchange, and the editor did not.On Monday the MP Nadine Dorries managed in a tweet to mistake the activist Ash Sarkar for another Asian woman, the Labour politician Faiza Shaheen. “When Tories think all brown women look the same,” tweeted Shaheen, pointing out the error. Dorries ended up claiming to Newsbeat that she had got confused by their accents, an excuse that fooled exactly no one.Politicians should leave Twitter: it risks their reputations and offers little in return, but there’s a reason why they won’t – buried within each of them is the same character flaw that caused their US equivalents to go on Ali G’s show: they’ll risk anything to show off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7ebc0648ea859321f0d45d581b2e11a170ca05/0_41_1972_1183/master/1972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8c20956ba2dc5ef5213df507e3094b","title":"renting furniture from ikea im not buying that idea","story":"Who really benefits from widespread rental? If I take home a Tobias or a Fanbyn, I want to buy it, sit on it and be left aloneIkea customers may soon be able to lease rather than buy new furniture. The initiative will be piloted in Switzerland, and is being described as an environmentally progressive step. But is it, though? Is that all it is? It is February, it is dark, and I have my suspicious glasses on. Also my cynical hat, and a thick jumper that says: “Don’t Trust Capitalism.” (I had to make it myself.)I thought generation rent applied only to young people being excluded from the housing market, then rampantly exploited by private landlords. But it is more than that, it is an expanding business model in which increasingly, we rent access to everything, all our music and TV, but also art, clothes, tyres, wedding cakes, caskets, pets. I don’t want to rent everything I have to touch or see with my eyes on a daily basis. It is the idea of having an ongoing relationship with a company that I kick against. I understand I have to consume things to live. But I would prefer the transaction to be short, self-contained and an accepted source of shame, like going to the toilet. Ikea says it is looking for ways for customers to “buy, care for and pass on products”. If I take home a Tobias or a Fanbyn, I want to buy it, sit on it and be left alone.Some renting suits our personality or circumstances: a previous partner latched on to streaming services immediately, realising Spotify was a way to free our home of my vast collection of Now That’s What I Call Music CDs. (Apart from No 31, which I strapped to a mattress slat under the bed, like a lost book of the bible.) There is a case to be made for renting short-term necessities such as tuxedos, maybe even textbooks. And I do believe a circular economy – one sustained by upcycling, refurbishing, narrowing of the energy loop, things an Ikea spokesman has said the company is committed to – are the future. But I like it grassroots. I’m part of a Facebook group in which people post photos of old mattresses going free on our neighbourhood streets, and, weirdly, I feel less icky about this. I recently downloaded the food-waste reduction app Olio, through which people donate their excess kefir grains, or you can pick up their unwanted ham because they’re going on holiday. (I’ve made it sound bad, but it’s really good.)I don’t have any particular beef with Ikea, I even like its meatballs. My sofa is a secondhand Ikea one, bought for £30 off Gumtree. I just find it impossible to trust any globalised, tax-efficient conglomerate’s motives. It’s an instinct that rises in me in direct proportion to all tactics designed to gainsay it all the kooky, best-buds packaging, greenwashed marketing and pseudo-profound adverts I am meant to find inspiring. I don’t want to be told I’m enough by a banana smoothie, or think I’m saving the Earth by switching my coffee table up.We need to refurbish our ideas about ownership and consumption, and stop letting markets tear us apart. But can these changes be led by organisations that have caused the problem? And is comprehensive renting the answer? I find it odd that the brighter future involves money leaving our accounts on a monthly basis, and flying towards the same companies, which control more and more of the material realities of our lives, while we own less and less. The comedian Bill Hicks bemoaned a world in which we put a dollar sign on everything on the planet. Did he imagine a ticking clock on everything in the world too, one in which the shirt can literally be taken from your back?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce/147_84_1757_1053/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aef9c696483c33cb068bf32dfd126ead","title":"statue margaret thatcher cue vandals","story":"Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it. Urban planners build footpaths, pedestrians forge their own desire lines. Hanging a “Do not climb” plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice. This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals, it will have to stand atop a three-metre (10ft) plinth.Creative critics of Thatcher’s legacy have already proposed workarounds: paintball target practice, hammer-throwing competitions, and the simple but trusty ladder. The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour, it will draw vandals and dissenters. Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately, it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all. Thatcher’s legacy remains with us today, and is still comfortably within living memory: that history, therefore, is still contested and fought over. Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history’s narrative.The inevitable vandalism will accurately reflect a toxic political legacy: the UK has long been cleaved by a social and class ide. Traditionally, the Conservatives have represented the interests of the ruling class and elite, and Labour the working class and more vulnerable. That two camps have such ergent views on the leader of one party is hardly a surprise. It is very likely that a statue of Tony Blair would also be immediately emblazoned with a spray-painted reference to war crimes for his role in the Iraq war. Freedom of expression isn’t always entirely polite, because feelings and emotions run deep, especially when people’s communities, livelihoods and loved ones have been jeopardised or harmed by the policies of these iniduals and their parties. Some councils operate a 10-year rule, to allow “passions to cool” before erecting a statue. Nonetheless, just this Monday Karl Marx’s memorial in Highgate cemetery was found vandalised.Perhaps statues have had their day. London in particular seems haunted by dark, metal figures of long-dead men, most with deep involvement in the bloody British colonial project, high-up roles in short wars, or simply the great fortune to be born into wealthy families. What do they teach us about history? Practically nothing. Barely anyone searches the background of a statue commemorating some man they’ve never heard of. These shadowy figures exist mostly to maintain the dominance of an inidual’s memory posthumously, or are erected in exchange for sizable bequests.Public sentiment around statues appears to be shifting. In 2018 a statue of Thatcher was rejected by Westminster council, despite being fitted with a hard-to-climb plinth and integral sockets for scaffolding to protect it during protests. The #RhodesMustFall movements in South Africa and Oxford, in the UK, forced some uncomfortable conversations about the degree to which colonial history is embedded in the architectural landscape of many institutions. Even when statues are not politically sensitive, they are not always welcome additions to the cultural landscape. The flat-out ridicule levelled at one of Cristiano Ronaldo, and another of Victoria Wood, shows the perils of trying to honour people in such a form: commemoration via statue can be high risk when capturing a likeness is the only point of the metal lump.Statues are only one way to tell us about history, and not even a good one. Murals, plaques marking important events, and public photographic exhibitions are more informative. History deserves to be in the public space and debated in the public realm. Growing up, I learned much about local history from murals commemorating the Chartist uprising and immediate murderous suppression of protestors in Newport, and a huge amount from almost every gable wall in Belfast. A statue of a prime minister has never taught me anything, bar the fact that too many of these people looked the same.If statues continue to play a part in public life, expect the public to engage with them, and not always with respect. In parliament, a bust of Oliver Cromwell was recently fitted with sensors after one or more MPs constantly turned it to face the wall in retaliation for his actions in Ireland. If Thatcher is hoisted atop a 10ft plinth, expect her to receive similar treatment. The will to vandalise her likeness is as much a part of the contestation of history as the right to leave her a bouquet of flowers.• Dawn Foster is a  columnist who writes on politics, social affairs and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1708c11b626446358b0ea5fe59c04e6aef662d/0_357_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03854c58eb70f40e8b1a4ab3fba47dad","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

Here three share their stories Black female professors face bullying and discrimination as they climb up the career ladder, according to a report surveying 20 of the 25 black female professors in the UK.The new research, from the University and College Union, explores the experiences of black female academics. They report being repeatedly overlooked for promotion, regularly confused for administrative staff and unsupported by other colleagues, including other women. Here, three black female academics across a range of roles share their personal accounts.Yaz Osho, senior lecturer in business enterprise, creation and management at the University of NorthumbriaSadly, the University and College Union report findings come as no surprise to me. Having spent 17 years in UK higher education, I’ve experienced racial stereotyping first-hand. Early on in my career I was informed by a senior academic that because of my race and gender I “should not be writing at the standard” that I was at the time, that I should have struggled to write altogether.I have witnessed many talented black female academics move abroad and achieve successful academic careers. These scholars failed to reach their career ambitions in the UK despite their talent, grit and determination. Black academics already suffer pay penalties in comparison with white male staff with equivalent academic backgrounds. They are also severely under-represented in senior leadership positions, which demonstrates some of the inequalities and challenges that black academics face.There needs to be an ongoing and open dialogue on race and racism in higher education. Black female academics should be at the heart of these discussions, structuring the course of action to tackle the challenges that they face. Although UK higher education has made strides, with equality and ersity policies and initiatives, these interventions fail to tackle the frontline pressures and disadvantages that black academics routinely face. We need to force open the dialogue on race and racism in higher education.Cecily Jones, former director of the Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of WarwickWith widening participation initiatives resulting in increased BAME student recruitment, black women academics are invariably forced to take on additional intellectual and emotional labour. As admissions tutor and open-day co-ordinator, prospective black students and their parents would inform me in hushed tones of their surprise at seeing a black woman academic leading recruitment presentations.More than one student would confide that my presence had encouraged them to apply to my department. Hardly a week passed without an impromptu gathering in my office of black students seeking advice, support or just wanting to spend a half hour with others who looked like them, decompressing from racist slights and micro-aggressions encountered from white tutors and students.Yet this additional labour is rarely taken into account for promotion purposes. As every BAME academic knows, securing promotion demands that one’s credentials exceed those of white colleagues. On two occasions, having more than satisfied the criteria, I was encouraged by my mentor to apply for promotion.Both times my promotion was denied on grounds of needing more administrative experience, even though on the second I had plenty tucked under my belt. It was some time later before I made the accidental discovery that the promotions committee had put me forward the second time, and that my head of department had blocked me.I’ve had other painful experiences: a colleague shared with me an email from another colleague that criticised multiculturalism, questioned my appointment, qualifications, experience, ability, integrity, my intellect and my managerial skills. Another time a complaint to a head of department about a first-year white male student’s aggressive exclamation that there was little that I could teach him was dismissed on the grounds that his words were in no way intended to be racist, but rather a comment on my ability as a woman.Few universities have transparent mechanisms for reporting racist incidents, and BAME faculty and students have little confidence that white staff charged with responsibility for investigating their complaints of racial harassment understand or recognise the complexities of racism. Policies, it would seem, are little more than paper tigers.Sabine Franklin, doctoral researcher in organisations, economy and society at the University of WestminsterThe UCU report reveals that the bullying and stereotyping of black female academics is a major problem in UK universities. This hostile environment not only blocks talented and gifted women of colour from rising through the ranks, but it also forces many of these women to leave the profession altogether. It is not only bullying which marginalises us: many disciplines are dominated by white men and we are trained to reference and cite from “key thinkers”. This often means underciting women and minority scholars. This practice does not always create good research, but it maintains that intellectual superiority is within an exclusive group.Many universities use equality and ersity statements to promote a erse campus to prospective students. However, they do not dedicate the human or financial resources to tackle racism. These findings reveal that senior level decision makers need to invest more to give all staff an equitable path to a professorial role.To transform the system would mean to change the status quo, and for those in the position of power that is a threat. Academia has maintained a perception of being progressive. It promotes the freedom of knowledge and fair access but maintains one of the oldest institutions of oppression. Universities have to address institutionalised racism to be a truly inclusive space, because right now women of colour are not afforded this dignity and remain marginalised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b423b748255bc3bbef0792a741411e758877d283/1258_0_3975_2387/master/3975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2949923c5483c240305b75593f21cde9","title":"germany air pollution limit eu backlash evidence world health organisation","story":"World Health Organization official comments on row about safe levels of nitrogen dioxide The World Health Organization says it has seen no evidence to support a German backlash against tough EU air pollution limits.The country’s transport minister, Andreas Scheuer, sent a letter to the European commission last week calling for a review of the EU’s nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits, despite signs of a government split over the issue.Scheuer’s claim that “increasing voices” in Germany’s medical profession were casting doubt on the science behind clean air benchmarks provoked a strong response from the EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella, who said if the limits were changed they would only be made stronger.The dispute followed an open letter by 107 German lung specialists who argued that health fears about vehicle exhaust emissions had been overblown.Prof Dieter Köhler, the paper’s author – and a former president of Germany’s Federal Association of Pulmonologists, Sleep and Respiratory Doctors (BdP) – is in Brussels for talks with senior EU environment over the issue, even though the BdP has disowned his opinion, describing the initiative as ill-informed “populism”.The WHO’s climate and health team leader, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, told the  the German material published so far should not be considered as a basis for discussion.“We need evidence to be published in a peer-reviewed journal and properly reviewed by experts,” he said. “We have heard the discussion but we’ve seen nothing that constitutes evidence, from our point of view. And we have guidelines that are based on thousands of scientific papers and drawn up by the world’s best possible experts.”Germany is one of several countries, including the UK, facing European court action for violating the air-quality directive, and its car industry has been scarred by Dieselgate, the Volkswagen emissions scandal.One EU source stressed that Tuesday’s meeting would not be allowed to influence a nearly completed fitness check of the EU’s air-quality directive, and had only been arranged as a “courtesy” to the doctor.“If his visit is merely a coincidence, it’s a remarkable one,” the source said, noting the German government’s recent loss of 16 domestic air pollution court cases. “There was no debate on NO2 prior to that.” The initiative had received “strong party political support” in the European parliament, the source added.Köhler will be appearing at meetings in Brussels with German conservative MEPs, including Peter Liese, a right-leaning member of the European parliament’s environment committee.Liese said he had wanted to help Köhler, whom he had known for years. “I don’t say he is right but he has important points to make and and I want responsible people in Brussels to listen,” he said. “When we want to maintain support for EU environmental policy, we need to react to legitimate criticism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Here’s a sharp, fruity version of the Chinese favouriteSweet and sour pork is a dish with a reputation problem one of the first Chinese foods many Britons will try, sugary and deep-fried, it’s a guaranteed crowdpleaser often wrongly dismissed as westernised junk. Prepared with care, however, and tailored to your own palate, sweet and sour pork – or, indeed, chicken, fish or tofu – can be as delicious as the first time you tasted it.Though this flavour combination is common throughout China, often in the form of a dipping sauce, like many British favourites, the version we know best comes from Guangzhou, and is a staple of the bright and noisy Hong Kong diner – though its fame has spread worldwide for the very simple reason that it hits all the right notes, wherever you are. Savoury and crunchy, sweet and tangy: it’s addictive stuff. Treat with caution.Though it can be tailored to just about any protein you like, I think the juicy texture of pork works particularly well in this dish and, according to YouTubers Steph and Chris of Chinese Cooking Demystified, “older variants… use pork belly instead of loin. At most restaurants nowadays, you’ll see this with lean meat, though, and we do prefer it here.” I’m inclined to agree: the edge of the fat on the pork belly used by Yan-Kit So in her Classic Chinese Cookbook goes deliciously crisp in the fryer, but the rest becomes annoyingly chewy belly is a cut better slow cooked.To my surprise, however, the spare ribs used in Kei Lum and Diora Fong Chan’s China: The Cookbook work much better, the meat remaining soft and juicy, while the bony bits are little more than vehicles for batter. Some of my testers find them a bit fiddly, however, so I’m going to stick with loin, though I would urge anyone who doesn’t mind getting up close and personal with some bones to give them a try (get your butcher to chop them up first they’re pretty hard on the old cleaver).Cut the meat nice and small Anglo-Chinese food writer Lizzie Mabbott muses: “I would go with pork shoulder strips. Chunks seem only appropriate for chicken, but I can’t explain why.” Having chewed my way through the great Ken Hom’s mighty 5cm cubes of fatty pork neck, I can explain why: chicken is a softer meat, pork has more heft to it.Loin might not need much in the way of tenderising, but a brief marinade will always add flavour we particularly like the garlicky soy mixture used by Amy and Julie Zhang in their Dumpling Sisters Cookbook. I don’t think you need to add any sugar at this point, because the sauce will be sweet anyway, but testers do enjoy the warmth of Chinese five spice in the recipe in Charmaine Solomon’s Complete Asian Cookbook.Slimmers stop reading now: though you can find recipes, like that from Ching He Huang, which simply stir-fry the meat, this is not health food – most sweet and sour pork is deep-fried, often doubly so, to make it “very crisp”, as Solomon puts it. You could skip the initial fry and blanch the pork first instead, as the Zhangs suggest, but that’s a bit of a faff, and I think has a tendency to make the meat slightly tough. Plus it means another pan to wash up.The protein is a movable feast, however you could probably even make this dish from battered Mars bars if you wanted, because the important thing is the sauce. Chef Jeremy Pang of School of Wok writes in his book Chinese Unchopped: “In the old days (way before the internet), sweet and sour was not red in colour at all, as it was predominantly made up of vinegar, sugar and dark soy sauce. However, with the heavy influence western culture now has, the Cantonese have found that ketchup provides the perfect balance and wrapping consistency for this dish. Who’s to say this recipe upgrade isn’t just as authentic as the old ways? As with any culture as it changes and adapts, it doesn’t make its expressions any less authentic it just makes them a product of the times.”They concede, however, that “if you don’t feel like screwing around with these fruit pastes, obviously don’t hesitate to reach for the ketchup. Basically every restaurant in Guangdong uses it, the vast majority of families use it … it’s absolutely an authentic addition to the dish.” I try a dollop of trusty Heinz in the Zhangs, So and Solomon’s recipes, and find that, when mixed with extra vinegar and sugar, it does indeed produce a sauce very close to the stuff I remember from restaurants – though not, it must be noted, quite as sweet and orange and gloopy as the glorious “proper sweet and sour sauce, like you get from a takeaway” made by chefs Chin and Choo Ziang using distilled malt vinegar and orange squash – “if you’ve ever wondered what that flavour is you can’t quite grasp, it’s orange squash”.Ken Hom, meanwhile, uses fresh orange juice, and So puts in pineapple juice – the extra citrussy tang of all of the versions using fruit prove more popular than the tasty but somewhat one-dimensional ketchup-only recipes, but most popular of all is the jam mixture, which has a fruity depth to it that the others lack, with a distinct berry sharpness from the cranberries. As I don’t have a particularly sweet tooth, I’m going to cut back on the sugar slightly (soft light brown makes a decent substitute for palm sugar here) – though feel free to adjust to your taste – and add a dash of soy sauce and Hom’s red rather than white vinegar, to help balance the potentially cloying sweet and sour flavours.Once you’re happy with the flavour, you’ll need to thicken it: both cornflour and potato starch work fine for this purpose.Many sweet and sour recipes are very simple indeed: Hom’s contains just shallots in the way of vegetable matter, and the Zhangs stick with the classic pineapple flavoured with ginger and garlic, but I think it’s far more interesting with a few other contrasting flavours and textures. I try spring onions, peas and water chestnuts, but come back to the traditional onion and green pepper pairing favoured by So, with extra pineapple – because, let’s be honest, it’s delicious – plus a sprinkling of Steph and Chris’s mild red chilli for warmth and colour. Use whatever you like, but just make sure you cut it fairly small so it stir-fries evenly.200g pork loin or lean shoulder1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry½ tsp salt¼ tsp Chinese five-spice powder (optional)To cook1 onion1 green pepper1 mild red chilli1 egg60g cornflour, plus extra to coatVegetable oil, to fry100g pineapple chunksFor the sauce2 tbsp apricot jam – the lower in sugar, the better1 tbsp cranberry sauce, ditto1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice25-40g soft light brown sugar2.5 tbsp Chinese red vinegar (ideally), or rice vinegar1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp cornflourServe with egg fried rice and probably something fresh and greenCut the pork into strips about 1cm wide.

Stir until the sugar dissolves, then stir in the vinegar, soy and 90ml water. Season to taste, adding more sugar, if you like. In a separate small bowl, stir together the cornflour and a teaspoon of cold water.Cut the onion and pepper into chunky diamonds, separating the onion layers as you go. Slice the chilli into rings.Beat the egg in a bowl until smooth, then stir in 60g cornflour to make a smooth batter, and season. Tip an extra tablespoon of cornflour into the pork and toss to coat. Coat a plate with more cornflour. Pour vegetable oil into a large pan or wok to fill by a third and heat to 180C 350F.Once the oil is nearly at temperature, dunk the pork in the batter, then shake off any excess and roll it in the plate of cornflour to coat. Fry in the hot oil for three minutes, until golden, then remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Keep the oil warm.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok until smoking, then stir-fry the onion, pepper and chilli until softened. Tip in the sauce mixture, bring up to a boil, then stir in the cornflour and water mixture, and cook until thickened.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!When Liverpool took just one point from the three available against Leicester last week, their more optimistic fans fell over themselves in the rush to view what others might consider a setback as a huge positive. Manchester City had somehow lost against Newcastle the night before, after all, which meant Jürgen Klopp’s side were still five points clear and that was still one hell of a cushion. Having seen City swat Arsenal aside over the weekend, Liverpool had the chance to restore the gap against West Ham, but were again forced to settle for a point. While undeniably better than the no points they almost certainly deserved, this particular one has not been welcomed quite as effusively by supporters who had to sit through another performance that was more nervous than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.Perhaps as baffled as the rest of us by a manager appearing to moan about match officials gifting his team a goal, the FA has asked Klopp to provide written observations over his comments and may well fine him if it decides he was accusing Friend of being deliberately biased in favour of West Ham by being accidentally biased in favour of Liverpool. It’s a philosophical conundrum that could have the blazers at FA HQ scratching their syrups in bewilderment but in the meantime there’s a fascinating title race to be run. With City facing Everton on Wednesday, Liverpool find themselves in the degrading position of having to root for the team that currently passes for their city rivals.“Goodison Park is always a tough game for us but the approach is the same - going there to try to win the game and, of course, we have the chance, because Liverpool don’t play, to go top of the league,” parped Pep, whose team can go top on goal difference if they can riff on the pain currently being endured by Everton. “What I’m more concerned about is to never forget who we are as a team. When doing what we have to do we are a strong team. That’s what I want to watch every single day. After we will see about the results, how the table is.” In a title race that is generating more knee-jerking than a Riverdance chorus line, the idea of simply enjoying this soap opera as it counts down to its natural conclusion seems far too sane.Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of the FA Cup fourth-round replays.“Well, there is no better way to invest than doing it in art, culture and creation” – Sergio Ramos explains why he has a giant statue of former Exeter City director Michael Jackson in his bathroom.Here’s the latest Football Weekly podcast.David Squires on … Everton’s annual crisis and celebrity cats.“In response to Nathan Eaton, I’m glad to say I have a few footballers with pop star names (yesterday’s Fiver letters).

When he was finally made available nearly half the First Division was said to be interested – at least until they heard how much they would have to pay. Not only had no British club spent as much as £1m on a footballer before, only one had paid more than £500,000 – and that was a few weeks earlier, when West Bromwich Albion lavished £516,000 on Middlesbrough’s David Mills. Only two clubs had pockets deep enough to match Birmingham’s asking price: Forest and Coventry City, who proposed a novel joint-ownership scheme with Detroit Express, the American team controlled by the Coventry chairman Jimmy Hill with whom Francis had played the previous summer.Brian Clough, then Forest’s manager, always maintained that he had refused to meet the asking price, capping his offer at £999,999. Francis insists Clough displayed no such reluctance, though the record would still have been his – with taxes and fees taking that total to around £1.15m. “Brian was very clever with the media,” he says. “He used to make headlines, and wasn’t bothered whether they were true or not. Birmingham insisted that the fee had to be a million pounds and nothing less, which eliminated many possible prospective buyers but there were two who were willing to pay it. I’m very fortunate and grateful that Forest were one of them, because at the time they were the only team in England that could challenge Liverpool.”Francis, nearly 25 at the time, was desperate for silverware. He had made his Birmingham debut aged 16 and went on to score 119 goals in 280 league appearances without ever vying for a significant trophy. “I want to be part of a successful team and unless I see signs that we are going somewhere I won’t stay,” he said after submitting a transfer request, swiftly rejected, in 1976. In 1978 he asked again. “I’m 24 in April and in another eight years I’ll probably be finished,” he told the . “I’ve not won a thing and without being unkind to the club it doesn’t look as if we’re going to win anything in the future.”In all Francis had six transfer requests rejected, without ever resorting to the kind of all-out funk with which players have forced their way out of similar situations. “It wouldn’t have been possible for me to do that, because of my character,” he says. “In my time if they said: ‘No, you’re not going,’ that was it.”Francis had spent the summer of 1978 in America, where he banked about £50,000 during a 22-match loan spell with Detroit. As a result he missed Birmingham’s first game of the following season, but Jim Smith, their new manager, said the player had provided in return “a firm assurance that he will stay with us, at least for the remaining two years of his contract”.Smith meanwhile had made a promise of his own. “He said to me he knew that I’d been looking to move on and play for a bigger club,” Francis says. “He told me he was a manager with great ambition, that he wanted the team to do well and wanted me to do everything I could to help him on the field, but then after Christmas if things had not improved he would do anything possible to help me get away. It was so refreshing for me to have someone as honest as Jim Smith, who was clear with me and stuck to his word.”Not only did Birmingham’s fortunes fail to improve under Smith, they deteriorated significantly. By the start of February 1979 they had eight points, their chances of survival were extremely remote, and Smith made good on his promise. On 7 February they accepted an offer from Forest, with Coventry making clear they would happily match it. The following day Francis had a four-hour meeting with Clough and Peter Taylor at the City Ground, departing with a promise to inform them of his decision the following morning.“They were very keen and wanted me to make a decision there and then,” Francis remembers. “What they didn’t realise is that I’d made my mind up before I’d even started negotiations, and after that meeting I was absolutely certain that what I wanted was to go to Forest. But out of respect for Coventry I felt I owed a phone call to their manager, Gordon Milne. I wanted him to be the first one to know what was going on.”Francis signed for Forest the following day, Clough turning up to his unveiling in a tracksuit, toting a squash racket. “We believe Trevor is the most exciting player in the country at this moment,” Taylor said. “Trevor is lucky he is joining Forest at their peak. He is joining us when Brian and I feel we are at our peaks. If we mess this up we may as well emigrate.”Forest had a good go at messing up the transfer. They failed to register their new player before he turned out in a third-team match against Notts County that weekend, in front of an estimated 40 people, which cost £250 in fines. A week later the necessary papers still hadn’t turned up, further delaying his full debut. “I don’t know what has happened to the forms,” said a club spokesman. The following month, with Francis ineligible to play in the European Cup quarter-final against Grasshoppers Zurich, Forest allowed him to fly by Concorde to play for Detroit Express in a friendly against New York Cosmos (he scored six times in an 8-2 win) and jet back again. The Football Association felt such an outing required its permission, and launched another inquiry.Francis’s time at Forest was repeatedly disrupted by injury but was famously crowned by the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup final, as well as crucial strikes in the quarter- and semi-finals as the club retained that title the following season. His place in football history, however, was already assured. “I never realised at the time the significance of it,” he says. “I smashed, literally smashed, the transfer record. Doubled it. It was just a magical figure – a million pounds. Paris Saint-Germain spent nearly £200m on Neymar, but I don’t think it has the same magical appeal that £1m did. On Saturday I’m going to be watching Plymouth against Portsmouth. I’m not going to be marking the day with anything special. But do I feel proud of being the first £1m player? Absolutely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4104bb854e1c5d1ec958d45ccf5af46e52338f/200_402_5560_3336/master/5560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39df3684f5ff30d19d91efdd6dd8fab1","title":"ebola drc democratic republic of the congo","story":"More than 750 people have died of Ebola in recent months in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with efforts to contain the outbreak hampered by conflict – and fear of treatment centresPhotographs by Kate HoltMedair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc8c29d02110128fea6ca3d6b431ecf690d78c4/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83a38a3ff546c81eb7e16c70d062617","title":"chinese lunar new year 2019 in pictures","story":"To welcome the year of the pig more than a billion people across the world have begun celebrating.

Some journalists had already arranged a post-it note system for awkward conversations. Desks were unusually tidy. News meetings were conducted with the utmost seriousness, with few jokes and no swearing. All of this was overlaid with football-style commentary describing what viewers were seeing, which often provided more insight than the raw footage.Staff appeared deeply self-conscious that their discussions were being broadcast to an audience of several thousand people, many of them journalists at rival organisations and media reporters desperately hoping to spot an embarrassing mistake. Some tried to look relaxed in what was clearly one of the least relaxing workplace environments ever.Digital editor Mark Alford, in a morning news meeting with his team, cracked a joke before turning to another member of staff: “Gemma, what have you got on showbiz?”Gemma replied: “Before showbiz, I don’t know you if you’ve seen this but Adam Parker just sent an email from Staffordshire police saying that four children have died in a house fire.”Suddenly the tone changed. Staff ceased their awkward laughter and adopted serious expressions, aware that their reactions were being broadcast live. Orders were given to scramble and then send a breaking news alert.Gemma returned to her showbiz list: “Angelina Jolie is in Bangladesh visiting the Rohingya … Paul McCartney has got a gold Blue Peter badge …”“For his services to music,” said Gemma, doing her best to do her day job.“Took him a long time to get a badge!” said someone else.A few moments later an alert was sent to those with the Sky News app announcing the house fire deaths in Staffordshire.Every awkward moment is broadcast live. There’s the slip of the tongue in which a staff member accidentally promises an interview on Northern Ireland with the deceased singer George Michael, rather than the former US senator George Mitchell.A separate news gallery filled with directors had been set up to ensure that footage of the main news gallery could be broadcast live. There was footage of editor-at-large Adam Boulton sitting on his own in a TV studio while waiting to go live, which always carries its risks.During one discussion on how to cover actor Liam Neeson’s comments on race, news output editor Nick Phipps asked his staff to find someone to go on air and make the argument that the views were “not acceptable”.“But fundamentally the piece is about Liam Neeson and what impact these comments will have on him and whether people want to see his films,” he added.At the end of a different news meeting, Sky News reporter Ashish Joshi swept in to ask veteran presenter Colin Brazier how the team meeting went.“It’s a quiet news day. It’s a patchy news day,” replied Brazier, who then admitted viewers had seen a sanitised version of what really happens behind the scenes: “Normally there’s quite a lot of gallows humour, which we excised from that meeting.”Sky News editor John Ryley was interviewed by one of his employees, as the on-screen caption described him as “one of the leading figures in British TV news”.“We feel it is very important that news organisations are transparent about the decisions that we make,” said Ryley, who helped to organise the strangely compelling experiment in newsroom transparency. “I’m keen to demonstrate that.”What Sky News Raw demonstrates is the effort and level of staffing needed to run Sky’s news output across TV, radio, and online – plus the detailed consideration that goes into every piece of material. But as the saying goes: if you like laws and sausages, you should never watch either one being made.”. Journalism could possibly be added to that list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

And then take a decision based on a calm consideration of what’s in Scotland’s best interests. And that’s what I would do. So I’m not going to say right now what I think the best timing would be.”Many observers suspect Sturgeon may delay that referendum until after the 2021 Holyrood elections. Pressed on why she would not call a second one now, Sturgeon again hinted strongly a second independence vote could be several years away.She said the chaos and uncertainty around Brexit made it clear that ill-informed or ill-judged decisions were a mistake.“Clearly, if people in Scotland are being asked, given the opportunity to look again at the independence question, they have a right to have as much information as possible about what – if Scotland chooses to be independent, what our relationships will be with the rest of the UK and with Europe,” she said.“And some of the answers to those questions inevitably depend on the Brexit outcome to some extent. And, therefore, I think it’s in the interest of allowing an informed decision to be taken about independence that we allow some of that clarity to emerge.“Brexit is a good example of what happens when people take, in some respects, an uninformed decision about a big change. And when people, as I believe they will in due course, opt for Scotland to be an independent country, that should be on the basis of a genuinely informed decision about all of the implications and consequences.”She has been pledging to update Holyrood and her party on her independence strategy for more than 18 months, following the SNP’s loss of 21 seats in the 2017 Westminster election in the wake of her first attempt to use Brexit as a justification for a quick second independence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f388748614c645431ae0733de592525425ec2b8e/0_260_4180_2508/master/4180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccfa8f7543778d3d67077ae2d2e7e6c3","title":"theresa may wont seamless border northern ireland brexit belfast","story":"In Belfast, PM says changing Brexit agreement is only way to get it through CommonsTheresa May has said she will not allow changes to the Brexit withdrawal agreement that give no insurance for the people of Northern Ireland, suggesting she would reject technology that disrupted border communities.Speaking in Belfast, she said MPs wanted to see changes to the backstop that could command support across the Commons but accepted that there were anxieties about replacing the arrangement.The backstop outlined in the withdrawal agreement would mean the UK remains in an effective customs union with the EU to prevent border checks at the Northern Irish border after the transition period, unless and until an alternative solution is found.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said, when asked about a deal without a backstop.In her speech, May sounded a note of caution about the alternative arrangements that some MPs have been working on to replace the backstop. She said a seamless border was “the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity”.“I will not do anything to put that at risk,” she said. “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Tory MPs from a number of different Brexit factions are working on a proposal for alternative technological arrangements to the backstop, known as the Malthouse Compromise after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who brought the groups together.The prime minister said she would never allow a hard border to be erected on the island of Ireland. “Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past,” she said at a speech in Belfast. “The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”May said she understood that the “prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the withdrawal agreement creates real anxiety” in Northern Ireland but it was necessary to get the deal through the Commons.Preserving peace was one of her “most profound responsibilities”, she said, going on to describe the Troubles beginning when she was 12 and the signing of the Belfast agreement when she was 41. “Violence has not been eliminated but it has been reduced to rates that would once have been impossible to imagine,” she said.May said she had come to terms with the fact that her deal could not command a majority, after its historic defeat last month by 230 votes.“I can only deliver on the commitment I have made if I can get a deal through the UK parliament.” The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to her speech. Several said they were frustrated that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear. “We’re none the wiser,” said one.Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border. “You’re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain. Northern Ireland is in the eye of the storm.”Journalists challenged May over her credibility with Northern Ireland business leaders given that she had mobilised them to campaign for a deal with the backstop, only to dump it. Connolly said she still had credibility. “We realise she is in a hard political game. But we need certainty and we need it now.”The prime minister is to return to Brussels on Thursday to seek fresh concessions despite the EU’s insistence that the bloc will not renegotiate the Brexit deal. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, will host the prime minister just 24 hours after his meeting with the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.May is expected formally to seek the reopening of the withdrawal agreement after the passing of the Brady amendment last week calling for “alternative arrangements” to replace the contentious Irish backstop.The prime minister told her cabinet ministers on Tuesday that the objective was to find a legally binding way to ensure the UK could not be trapped indefinitely in the backstop, though alternative arrangements, a time-limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, was in Brussels overnight, ahead of the prime minister’s visit, meeting “a combination of European politicians and officials”, according to No 10.Downing Street would not be drawn on whether May would present just one or a number of possible options when she meets Juncker. “Work is ongoing urgently on all three proposals” the spokesman said.May will spend the night in Belfast and meet representatives from the UUP, Alliance, SDLP, DUP and Sinn Féin, and the leader of the Northern Ireland Conservatives on Wednesday morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04e278c9e78b2d7edf41ad6ba93d1281e5461ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d3aa46cf04022679bd293875a9a2e8","title":"the uk no longer feels like home the british europhiles racing for eu passports","story":"Thousands of Britons have applied for citizenship elsewhere since the Brexit vote. Here,  readers across Europe explain why they made the decisionBrexit is turning the UK into a country of dual citizens. An Irish grandparent is now the most prized possession in the land, giving the proud owner the right to an Irish (and thus an EU) passport. Applications for Irish passports are surging – 200,000 Britons applied in 2018. About half of these were from Northern Ireland – anyone born on the island of Ireland before 2005 and anyone born there since with a parent who is Irish, British or “entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish state without restriction on their residency” is entitled to Irish citizenship. The other half are Britons living outside Ireland who have suddenly discovered an affinity with the birthplace of a parent or a grandparent. The number of applications has doubled since the referendum, with by far the greater increase coming from outside the island of Ireland. That burgundy passport is now extremely highly prized.My family is contributing to this: my son, through my wife, has an Irish grandmother and has claimed Irish citizenship. This year, he may visit his new homeland for the first time. His grandmother, who was born near Cork, came over to join the war effort against Hitler and never returned. Eighty years on, her daughter and grandson retain a foothold in the EU and a place in the postwar vision of a unified Europe.The Mosses are not alone. Indeed, the pursuit of dual nationality by Britons disaffected by Brexit or seeking to protect their residential, health or working rights is happening all over Europe. When we asked  readers who have applied for citizenship elsewhere to get in touch, more than 1,100 people replied. Many were applying for Irish, German, French, Belgian and Swedish citizenship, but plenty of other countries were represented, including Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary and Malta. There were a surprising number of applications for Latvian citizenship, some from descendants of Latvians who fled to the UK following the Soviet takeover of their country in 1944.John Gribbon, an IT manager who lives and works in England, is one of the hundreds of thousands who have become Irish recently – his citizenship was granted in 2018. “I wanted the opportunity to work wherever I chose in Europe and did not welcome the fact that the opportunity had been removed by the Brexiteers,” he says.Gribbon’s grandfather, who died in 1964, was born in Belfast in 1915, served in the British army and worked as a sheet-metal worker in the Tyne shipyards. He had nine children and “lived for their freedom and opportunity”, says 46-year-old Gribbon, who has become an Irish citizen to preserve his own freedom and opportunity. “I had the Willy Wonka ticket 100 years later,” he says. “Although I never met him, his parting gift, being an Irishman, was the best present I could ever have. England was my past and will always be part of me as it’s who I am, but Ireland will give me the freedom to be who I want to be.”Matt Hurley, a 22-year-old Earth sciences master’s student at Utrecht University, became an Irish citizen in 2017. “I have always felt that I was Irish, as my father is Irish, while my mother was born in England to Irish parents,” he says. “I had never contemplated getting Irish citizenship, as it felt like I was taking something from a country I have never contributed to.” But now, he says: “Britain no longer feels like home, as it has rejected Europe and I have not.” Of course, there are also practical advantages: “Getting an Irish passport has enabled me to live abroad without the worry of my tuition fees being increased to the same level as non-EU students or having to apply for some kind of student visa.”The statistics on Irish dual citizenship are particularly notable because the number of Britons eligible is far higher than for any other country and the process of applying is straightforward – automatic and free citizenship for children of people born in Ireland on production of the relevant birth documents a fee of about £250 (£130 for children) to get yourself on the Foreign Births Register if you were born outside Ireland but have an Irish grandparent. However, the same pattern is apparent throughout Europe (except in Spain and Poland, neither of which permits dual citizenship for foreign nationals – one reason why so many British expats in Spain are likely to return in the event of a no-deal Brexit). The number of UK citizens who applied for German citizenship, for instance, more than doubled in 2017 compared with 2016, rising from 2,865 to 7,493. The number of Britons applying to become German is more than 10 times greater than before the 2016 referendum.One remarkable result of the EU referendum is the number of people whose families fled the Nazis who are now reclaiming German citizenship. “I was born in Palestine in 1944, the child of stateless German-born refugees who had been deprived of their citizenship because they were deemed to be Jewish,” says Nancy Krauss, a retired doctor in East Anglia. “I was brought up only speaking English because my parents wanted us to feel as though we belonged to the UK. I am now applying for German citizenship alongside my British citizenship. The spur was Brexit. German citizenship will allow me, my daughter and grandchildren to remain European, which gives us more options if things get very difficult in this country. Underlying that, though, is a sense of righting a wrong, returning to the roots – at least mentally – that belonged to my parents and of which they were unjustly deprived. If the German government now wants to make amends, I welcome that.”Germany is extremely popular because it ranks third (with France) on the Henley Passport Index, which ranks countries by the number of destinations passport-holders can visit without having to arrange a visa. Ben Wright, a 51-year-old management consultant who lives in Germany with his wife and family, has just become a dual citizen. “I’ve spent the past 25 years working, living and travelling across Europe,” he says. “I’ve seen walls come down and barriers to movement fall. Brexit is offering blue passports. That doesn’t disguise the fact the passport is being devalued.” Wright blames Theresa May. “The Brexit vote was not the major issue,” he says. “It was May’s decision that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union. That makes a new passport essential, in case I want to work in Switzerland or elsewhere in the EU.”Karen Stone, the general manager and artistic director of the theatres and orchestra of Magdeburg, waited barely a day after the referendum to start her application for dual citizenship. “It took a year, huge amounts of paperwork, an exam to prove that I was fluent in German and another on the German law and constitution,” she says. “The whole thing cost around €1,200, but now I finally have the guarantee of the same freedom of movement and security that I had for the previous 40 years.”Like many people who have lived abroad for a long period, she is furious that she was not allowed to vote in the referendum because she had lived outside the UK for more than 15 years – the cut-off for eligibility. “I hope that, should there be a second referendum, this decision would be reviewed,” she says.The number of Britons applying for Dutch, Swedish and French citizenship has risen enormously, too. In the absence of any progress on Guy Verhofstadt’s idea to offer Europe-minded Britons associate citizenship of the EU, those who qualify – by birth, marriage or residence – for another European country are taking matters into their own hands.In France, Beci Clayton was quick to apply after the referendum result, worried that if she did not her family would find themselves in difficulties. The 35-year-old English teacher lives in Brittany and is married to a French man her two young children are dual nationals. “I had always thought we would return to the UK I no longer know if that will be possible, but at least I know that my family will be able to stay together in France. I will be able to live and work in France indefinitely and this is a great relief for me. My national identity used to be hugely important to me. Now I am embarrassed to be British and feel quite lost.”Peter Tuck, a 45-year-old vet in Grosbliederstroff – which sounds German, but is in north-eastern France, right on the border of the two countries – is in a similar situation. “I moved to France in 2002 with my German wife and we have been living here ever since. Our two children were born in France. We live in France, but our children cross the border every day to go to school in Saarbrücken,” he says.“After the referendum, we went through the French naturalisation process quite quickly. For us, freedom of movement is a joy and a privilege. Our region is completely dependent on the border being open and invisible and we can’t imagine anyone wanting to reintroduce checks that have been removed. For my kids, Brexit is incomprehensible.”James Reynolds is a 38-year-old teacher at an international school in Staffanstorp, Sweden. Married to a Swedish woman and with a two-year-old son, he was worried about his family’s rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit – and about the rules regarding income levels for spouses if he wanted to relocate to the UK. “I have decided most probably never to return to the UK, as my family doesn’t feel welcome,” he says. “This is a shame, as I’m a UK-qualified teacher with 15 years’ experience, although it has to be said that teaching in Sweden is far less stressful than in the UK.”Romit Jain, a 43-year-old Londoner of Indian heritage, is another Briton who has successfully sought Swedish citizenship. “I applied within a week of the referendum and was granted citizenship within four weeks,” says Jain, who works for a Swedish company and is currently based in South Africa. “I was eligible for Swedish citizenship because I am married to a Swede and had been living there for about five years. The process went incredibly smoothly and I even got a nationality certificate in the post. My wife doesn’t have one of those, so I joke that this makes me more Swedish than her.”Jain embodies the ludicrousness of May’s denigration of “citizens of nowhere”. “Swedes used to ask me, before the referendum, if I would take Swedish nationality, because I was eligible anyway,” he says. “I always answered that I didn’t need it and I saw it as a practical question, as opposed to one about identity. But after the referendum I realised that it is about identity as well. I feel Swedish and British, European and Indian. I don’t see that as contradictory, although England versus Sweden in the World Cup was tricky.”Some people didn’t even wait for the referendum result before they started the process of getting a second passport. Richard Ventham, a 44-year-old who works in the pharmaceutical industry, began investigating dual citizenship when David Cameron announced he would hold a referendum. Having lived in Belgium since 2003, he says: “I couldn’t trust the xenophobic British public to make the right decision. I became Belgian in March 2016 and haven’t had a sleepless night since. I’m European – and no xenophobic, closed-minded, small majority can take that away from me.”Ventham is rather more emotional and committed a European than most of the bloodless technocrats who argued for remain in 2016. He describes the potential loss of freedom of movement as a “tragedy”. “My wife and children are Belgian. I suppose some people think I jumped the gun to apply prior to the referendum, but I could read the runes and the hysteria in the tabloid newspapers and wanted my status assured. I cling on to hope of a second referendum to reverse the decision, but as I’ve lived in Belgium for more than 15 years I’m no longer eligible to vote in it. I’ve been disenfranchised.”Oliver Gompertz, a pilot based in London, is applying for a Maltese passport. “People often scoff and ask: ‘Is that the one you can just buy?’” he says, referring to the countries that offer a fast track to permanent residence and sometimes citizenship if applicants are willing to make a substantial investment in the country. “But I’m entitled to it through my grandparents.” It has not, however, been a straightforward process: “I started assembling the documentation required more than three years ago and then it was a question of getting appointments with the embassy in London, which took about six months, and then waiting for your application to be processed, which took another 18 months. Then you need another appointment to get your passport.”He believes it will be worth it. “It’s partly about career security,” he says. “But for me it’s mainly about how I feel about my identity. When you go to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand – crossing the border, you’re made to feel like an outsider because you don’t have the right to be there. I don’t want to feel like that going to Europe.”For many people, it is a practical issue, too. Jane Johnson, a 55-year-old academic in Bologna, Italy, has just completed an application for Italian citizenship. She was motivated, she says, in part by fear of losing “access to the wonderful state health service in Bologna”.But I believe Gompertz’s more emotive argument resonates. For almost 50 years, despite the half-heartedness of the British political class, we have been citizens of Europe, with unfettered access to that beautiful, varied, culturally rich continent. Some part of us could claim to be French or Spanish, Italian or German. We had fought many wars with our neighbours now we could enjoy a long peace and claim a stake in their wonderful countries.Brexit may change this for ever. While my wife and son are safe in their new nationalities, the angry Welshman in our family – me – is about to lose his EU passport and the fantasy that he is Spanish. Is this really the end of the dream? If I set up a small business in Plov, how long will it be before I qualify for Bulgarian citizenship?Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5614979453aa415e07c58c483d78d354a468039/0_334_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d28c39c7420902c2cfff9ba58e7157c","title":"stakes high richard freeman british cycling team sky questions","story":"When Richard Freeman, the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor, walks into the St James’s Building in Manchester to face a medical tribunal on Wednesday he knows his career will be on the line. And so, in a way, will be the reputations of the organisations he worked for.For Freeman’s case, brought by the General Medical Council, centres on claims he ordered banned testosterone for an unnamed rider in 2011 – and then tried to cover his tracks.The 57-year-old, who denies any wrongdoing, is also alleged to have lied to the UK Anti-Doping Agency, provided inappropriate treatment to non-riding staff and kept haphazard records. Freeman worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017.The stakes are high and, with several current and former members of Team Sky and British Cycling expected to give evidence, there is hope some light will be shone on one of the more curious incidents in British sport in recent years.Freeman is alleged to have ordered 30 sachets of Testogel, which is on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s prohibited list, in May 2011 to be sent to the Manchester velodrome to “administer to an athlete to improve their athletic performance” – and then lied about it.Freeman is accused of first lying to other members of British Cycling about ordering the drug, saying it was a mistake by the Oldham-based supplier Fit4Sport. Then, five months later in October 2011, he is alleged to have asked Fit4Sport “for written confirmation the testosterone had been sent in error, returned and would be destroyed, knowing this had not taken place”. It is claimed he then showed the email he sent to others knowing it to be “untrue”.Yes. When questioned by UK Anti-Doping in February 2017 Freeman said he had ordered Testogel for a non-athlete member of staff but returned it. However it is alleged he “made untrue statements” to Ukad when he made these claims and that his conduct was “dishonest”.No, reportedly because of doctor-patient confidentiality.Freeman is also accused of having acted inappropriately by treating medical staff who were not riders. Brailsford, now the head of Team Sky, has confirmed he was injected with the corticosteroid triamcinolone by Freeman to treat acute swelling in his knee. Keith Lambert, a British Cycling academy coach, has also said he was injected with triamcinolone by Freeman to treat arthritis in his hand.Yes. Freeman’s haphazard medical record-keeping, which was criticised by Ukad when it looked into a separate case regarding a bag delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2011, will also be investigated. The tribunal will also look into allegations Freeman failed to ensure records stored on a laptop stolen in 2014 could be retrieved.Freeman’s case, which could run until 6 March, will be heard by three tribunal members. It will begin with the case against Freeman being set out by the GMC either on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning, while Freeman will start his defence after the GMC has finished interviewing all their witnesses. A list of witnesses has not yet been released but Peters and British Cycling’s former technical director Shane Sutton are among those expected to give evidence. Freeman is also expected to testify, although there are concerns he may not attend given he cited a stress-related illness for not giving evidence to a parliamentary select committee that tried to ascertain the contents of the bag delivered to Wiggins.If the charges against Freeman are upheld he is likely to be struck off. If fresh evidence emerges about who received the testosterone it could also lead to UK Anti-Doping, who will attend the tribunal as keen observers, beginning a fresh investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d92639fee97068d7232079ce8aa629cae4a891/157_194_2107_1264/master/2107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19d51970337142bf51565bd44f60091","title":"thousands of six nations tickets touted on viagogo investigation reveals","story":"Thousands of tickets for the Six Nations have appeared for sale on the controversial website Viagogo for a combined £370,000, according to  analysis that illustrates the grip wielded by ticket touts over in-demand events.Details of the scale at which Six Nations tickets are being touted prompted concern from the digital minister, Margot James, and condemnation from rugby governing bodies, who warned that Viagogo’s customers risk being refused entry at the turnstile. examined 1,155 tickets with a “Trader” label advertised on Viagogo for the Six Nations and found they were being listed for £369,526, including VAT, delivery costs and booking fees, collected by the website.The true amount of tickets controlled by touts is likely to be much higher, given that the ’s analysis covered only two days of Viagogo listings.These tickets, two-thirds of which were in the hands of just five traders, are listed despite the risk that buyers will be turned away at the door.James said the ’s findings were very concerning. “Fans should be able to attend major sporting events at a fair price,” she said.She pointed out that Viagogo was the subject of a court order by the Competition and Markets Authority, which has taken action against the company over alleged breaches of consumer law. “Viagogo must now make any necessary changes without delay and I expect the CMA to take further action if they fail to do so,” she said.The CMA has already warned that it has “serious concerns” about Viagogo’s compliance with the terms of the court order. And listings for Six Nations games raise fresh doubts about whether the company is abiding by its terms.The trader with the highest combined ticket worth was listed as Enda Stanley who had 173 tickets for sale with a total asking price of £79,719 (including booking fees and delivery).While the CMA’s court order calls for traders’ full contact information to be advertised, entries for Stanley’s tickets simply listed his details as “Dublin”.The highest number of tickets for sale by an inidual trader, who listed 290 tickets with a combined price of £64,704.Another prolific seller, a company called Tick Tock Ltd that listed its address as Panama City, had 100 tickets the combined cost of which stood at £45,981. Another trader, Candy \u0026amp Co, gave a postbox address in Texas, while a fifth, Tyne and Wear Ltd, is based in Newcastle.The most expensive tickets, for sale by a trader listed as “harry tout” carried a total cost of £4,772 for two seats in the fourth row with a view of the tryline for the sold-out match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield on 9 February.The tickets were marked as “Resale not allowed”.Despite the CMA’s court order, which demands that traders give their genuine contact details, the address for “harry tout” was given as the Scottish newspaper the Daily Record, which has campaigned virulently against ticket touting. The Daily Record said it had no involvement with the listing.None of the traders could be reached for comment.A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said the use of secondary market websites to resell tickets is prohibited by the RFU’s ticket terms and conditions and that ticket holders known to have breached the terms and conditions would be refused entry.“Where tickets are resold on secondary market websites – especially at inflated prices – it is not just the genuine fans, but the wider game, whom suffer.”The Irish Rugby Football Union urged fans not to buy resold tickets, which they said might be cancelled. The Welsh Rugby Union also warned fans against buying from ticket resale companies, warning that buyers risked ejection from the ground.This stance does not appear to dissuade traders. Touts have 194 tickets for sale for Scotland vIreland alone with a combined ticket price of £57,758 which, if sold, will prove the most lucrative game of the tournament for traders.Traders are selling 223 tickets for sale for the Scotland v Wales match on 9 March with a combined value of £49,318.When contacted, Viagogo said it was “perfectly legal” to resell tickets and that any bought through its website were valid and should not result in fans being turned away.A spokesperson said: “Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal.“Therefore, as with all tickets on our platform, Viagogo customers should feel confident that they will gain entry to the event, and that is why we back every ticket with the Viagogo guarantee.”Under the terms of the CMA’s court order secured against the company, Viagogo has been obliged to publish not just names of touts but also more detailed information about what consumers are buying, such as seat number at the venue.But the  found dozens of cases that did not display the seat number.Tom Watson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport and deputy Labour leader, said it was “disgraceful to see that ticket touts on Viagogo are still ripping off rugby fans”.“Viagogo has been told time and again that it needs to clean up its act. They are flagrantly disobeying the law and even ignoring a court order. It’s unacceptable that consumers may not be able to see basic details about their tickets, like the seller’s name and the seat number. Secondary ticketing platforms have been taking advantage of loyal fans for far too long. This has got to change.”In late January the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which had given Viagogo until mid-January to overhaul its business practices, said the changes made by Viagogo on foot of the court order were “insufficient”.Viagogo, in turn, issued a statement which simply said: “We are compliant.” analysed all listings for Six Nations tickets listed on the Viagogo website which carried a “Trader” logo on two consecutive days.The analysis covers 1,007 unique tickets on sale on the Viagogo website on Wednesday 30 January plus 148 unique tickets which subsequently came up for sale on Thursday 31 January. Checks were carried out to ensure no duplicate tickets were recorded by manually checking the ticket details, price and trader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f601f3865a5dfcbb6b31e74085fba43b977686ee/0_354_4674_2805/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a3cdf5d9f05bfd62e231ce537f8f39","title":"gerry cranham simply the best in pictures","story":"Over the course of a career which ned half a century, photographer Gerry Cranham led the field of sports photography, defining how we understand this genre today.

While he was there he got a ticket for an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq on 22 January. The tournament took place in the UAE between 5 January and 1 February and was won by Qatar.Ahmad wore a Qatar shirt to the match not knowing that doing so in the UAE is an offence punishable with a large fine and an extended period of imprisonment.After his initial arrest he was held over claims that he had made false allegations about security officials, a friend of Ahmad told the .The UAE embassy said it was investigating the circumstances of the arrest and the Foreign Office (FCO) said it was offering support.The FCO website in its section containing information for travellers to the UAE warns: “The UAE authorities announced on 7 June 2017 that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine.”Its advice adds: “You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. There may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK.”The sanctions for “promoting” Qatar are linked to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the two countries in May 2017. The UAE accused Qatar of undermining security and stability in the region by funding and hosting terror groups. Ahmad was granted one phone call on 31 January and was able to call his friend Amer Lokie and raise the alarm.Lokie said: “This is just unspeakable. He just went to watch a football match while he was on holiday in UAE and says he was arrested and beaten after being accused of wearing a football shirt which promoted Qatar. When he managed to call me officials were sitting next to him so he couldn’t say too much. He wasn’t given very long to speak to me and I’m not exactly sure what happened.“It seems that he was released after being detained, assaulted by the security men in the car and accused of promoting Qatar. He went to the police station to report the assault and was accused of telling lies about the incident.“We’re not clear about exactly what happened next but he has been held because he is accused of making false allegations against UAE security officials. He said he is being held in a place called Al Sharjar.”Lokie added: “He loves football so much. He goes to watch lots of football matches in the UK. He’s such a kind and quiet guy. He is the kind of person who always tries to help others.“He didn’t sound good when he spoke to me on the phone. He was speaking very slowly and he sounded very frightened.”Lokie said that Ahmad’s phone had been taken by officials and wiped, adding that his friend had told him he was held in a small room for two days.“He begged us to do whatever we can to get him released so we contacted the Foreign Office and asked them to help get him released,” Lokie said. “He said he would call us back but since then we have not heard anything from him. I am in shock that he was arrested and assaulted because of the football T-shirt he was wearing. We are all so worried about him. This is very serious.”A UAE embassy spokesperson said: “The United Arab Emirates embassy is looking into allegations that a British citizen has been detained. The UAE is a nation built on the rule of law and respect for iniduals. We take any allegation of human rights violations extremely seriously – whether it concerns one of our citizens, or any of the 1.5 million Britons who visit us each year.”An FCO spokesperson said: “We are providing assistance to a British man arrested in the UAE and are in touch with the local authorities.”Last November the British academic Matthew Hedges returned to the UK after being accused of spying and jailed for life in UAE. He served seven months of his sentence, mostly in solitary confinement. He was released after receiving a pardon from the UAE authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/404ab9177077dc2666a767581d15f6d0d76118b9/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43aaeea6377be0a7a7f9ef9bda8ef50","title":"uae expatriate workers marvel at mass with pope francis","story":"Show of public Christian worship considered largest ever seen on the Arabian peninsulaMarivic Sorita’s eyes filled with tears as she spoke of her daughters back in the Philippines. She has seen them only three times in the 11 years she has worked as a housemaid in Abu Dhabi. Her eldest, now 21, recently completed her studies “thanks to the sacrifice” Sorita made by the separation, sending almost all her salary back home.Maybe one day, when her 14-year-old daughter has also finished her studies, Sorita would be able to go back to Manila and be reunited with her family. But for now, she was enjoying a rare day off work for what she described as a “very, very special” occasion.Sorita, 40, was one of thousands of people packed into the all-seater Zayed Sports City stadium in Abu Dhabi to celebrate mass with Pope Francis on Tuesday, with many more outside, watching on big screens. It was the highlight of the first ever papal visit to the Arabian peninsula, and for millions of expatriate workers in the United Arab Emirates – many of them devout Catholics from countries in Asia – it was a momentous day.“I’m very tired, I had no sleep,” said Sorita who, like many of those who had secured tickets to the mass, had been up all night. “But I’m just happy to be here, to see the pope and to celebrate mass.” She rarely went to mass “There is no time, I am always working,” she said.Berna Ros, another Filipino working as a manager for an Abu Dhabi company, said seeing the pope was the “most special moment in my life. I am blessed.”Her five children, aged between nine and 25, were also back in the Philippines, but Ros managed an annual visit home. She attended mass every week in Abu Dhabi. “We are allowed to worship freely. There is no pressure from the government,” she said.The pope entered the stadium under a blazing winter sun in an open-sided vehicle, with security guards jogging alongside and a helicopter hovering overhead. People, sporting pope-branded baseball caps and waving Vatican flags that had been distributed by volunteers, pressed against barriers to catch a glimpse of the Holy Father. Most held up phones to capture a picture of the pope some thrust out babies and small children in the hope of a papal smile or wave.The 90-minute open-air mass was considered by some to be the largest show of public Christian worship ever seen on the Arabian peninsula, the birthplace of Islam. Hallelujas and chants of “Pope Francis” and “Viva Il Papa” boomed out from speakers inside and outside the stadium.More than 100 nationalities were represented among the 135,000 crowd, with about 4,000 Muslims in attendance, organisers said.In his homily, delivered in Italian and translated into Arabic with English subtitles provided on screens, Francis directly addressed many of the expatriate Catholic workers in the stadium and beyond.“It is most certainly not easy for you to live far from home, missing the affections of your loved ones, and perhaps also feeling uncertainty about the future. But the Lord is faithful and does not abandon his people,” he said.The pope – speaking in a country famous for its skyscrapers including the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai – said that Jesus “did not ask us to build great works or draw attention to ourselves with extraordinary gestures. He asked us to produce just one work of art, possible for everyone: our own life.”Charmaine Karunaratne, 78, had travelled to the UAE from Sri Lanka to visit her daughter and grandchildren who have lived in Abu Dhabi for four years. A devout Catholic, she said it was “like heaven to see the pope”, adding that she admired his focus on the poor, and his rejection of personal luxuries.Her enthusiasm was shared by Samira Ahmed Diria Bokhari, a diplomat from Tanzania and a Muslim. “I came to mark this great day of history, a pope celebrating mass in the heart of Islam. Who would miss this opportunity?”The pope’s three-day visit to the UAE was to mark the Emirates’ “year of tolerance”. On Monday, the pope and the grand imam of al-Azhar signed a historic declaration of fraternity, calling for peace between nations, religions and races, in front of a global audience of religious leaders from Christianity, Islam, Judaism and other faiths.The document said: “We resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood.”Newspapers in Saudi Arabia, where churches are banned, ran pictures of the ceremonial signing by the pope and the grand imam.Before Tuesday’s mass, Pope Francis made a private visit to St Joseph’s cathedral. He was due to return to Rome later in the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: Anna EnrightPA WireIrish nurses working abroad say the Government does not respect the workforce, and gives emigrants no reason to come home.On Saturday, The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) announced two additional strike dates amid an ongoing row over pay and staffing retention issues.The strikes will take place on February 19th and 21st, in addition to action on February 5th and 7th, and February 12th - 14th.Anna Enright, from Tralee, Co Kerry, has lived and worked as a nurse in Melbourne, Australia, for five years.“When I first started I worked in hospitals in the midlands on three-month contracts for €13.60 an hour,” she said.“We were worked to the bone in unsafe conditions because of chronic understaffing.“There was no support, no room for job growth, not to mention the salary.“There are amazing nurses in Ireland, they work so hard considering what they’re put through.“I’m very angry over it, I’ve been speaking to the girls at home who are striking, my heart breaks for them.“I honestly feel bad, and kind of guilty at how good we have it over here, we make money that allows us to have a great lifestyle, we enjoy work, are so supported to grow in our field.“Nursing is highly respected over here, whereas I feel in Ireland it never will be, to be honest I can’t see a change happening, the Government don’t respect nursing as a profession to increase our pay, it’s not that we are greedy for money, we need to be able to live.”More than 30,000 nurses took to picket lines in freezing conditions outside hospitals across the country last week after talks aimed at resolving the issue failed.Nurses are calling for a pay increase of about 12 per cent, but the Government has said it is not in the position to borrow money.The Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe, said: “The nursing unions are seeking a significant increase in pay over and above all of the benefits of the current Agreement seeking parity with other health professionals.“Concession of this pay claim, even if possible, would have serious consequences for the public finances and for public pay policy generally with estimated costs of 300 million euro annually based on a 12 per cent claim in pay.“However, it would not end there. “It would, I have no doubt, generate knock-on or ‘leapfrogging’ claims from the rest of the public service workforce, where there are already other well aired pay grievances.”Last week, protests were organised in Melbourne, Sydney and London by Irish nurses to show their solidarity with their colleagues at home. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3782719.1549376319!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second day of nurses strike has dramatic impact on services","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            INMO Strike: Nurses take to the picket line outside St James’ Hospital in Dublin Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            INMO Strike: Nurses take to the picket line outside St James’ Hospital in Dublin Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            INMO Strike: Nurses take to the picket line outside St James’ Hospital in Dublin Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            General Secretary of the INMO, Phil Ni Sheaghdha says strikes will continue until pay is resolved. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe second day of industrial strikes by Irish nurses and midwives has had a “dramatic impact” on services and also led to considerable criticism of the Government from the Opposition and the public.Around 40,000 nurses and midwives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) are striking over pay, which they claim is leading to staff retention issues.They are seeking pay parity with other medical professionals which would equate to an approximately € 7,000 pay rise per nurse, or a rise of around 12 per cent. The Government says it is not in the position to fund pay increases and that to do so would prompt pay claims from other public servants.Tuesday is the second in a series of eight planned 24-hour strikes planned by nurses in pursuit of their pay claim. Nurses have picketed 240 locations - up from 82 facilities from the first stoppage on Wednesday last week. About 50,000 people have had medical appointments cancelled today due to the strike.Emergency departments are open but with reduced nursing staff cover so the HSE are asking people not to go to emergency departments unless absolutely necessary.Community nursing services and health centre nurse clinics are also closed. Injury units are closed and all day surgery, outpatient and inpatient surgery appointments have been cancelled.The affected services now include respite centres for people with disabilities and elderly people.The HSE’s interim national director of Community Operations, David Walsh said no admissions for respite care had been made this week due to the nurses strike.He told RTÉ’s News at One he did not have an exact figures of the numbers impacted but said the lack of respite services would affect the elderly and young people with disabilities who required respite as part of their package of support.The ongoing industrial action is going to have “a dramatic impact” on the level of support for older people. Mr Walsh said he was most concerned at the impact of the lack of public health nurse visits on the elderly and babies.Further strikes are scheduled to take place on February 7th, and February 12th, 13th, 14th, 19th and 21st.According to the INMO, the Government must address nurses’ salaries to resolve the dispute.Speaking at St James’s Hospital in Dublin today, the head of the INMO Phil Ní Sheaghdha said nurses were said any settlement would have to involve a review of pay scales.“The reason nurses are leaving (the country) is that they are being offered better pay abroad. We are in a competitive market,” Ms Ní Sheaghdha said.“If the Government insists the only remedy cannot involve pay, then we have a huge problem.”The unions last night rejected proposals from Minister for Health Simon Harris to hold talks aimed at resolving the dispute which would focus on staffing issues, but not pay. Ms Ní Sheaghdha said this offer was “cynical”.“Nurses are taking a stand. They are saying this is not good enough. We have to open more beds but we will never do that without an increase in the nurse population. And to do that you have to look at the base salary,” Ms Ní Sheaghdha said.She said the public had been very supportive of nurses in the current dispute and understood nurses were taking a stand on their behalf.She said pay awards that nurses were receiving under the current public service agreement represented a restoration of previous cuts.She said maintained that when this agreement expires at the end of 2020 nurses would be earning less than in 2008. Last week the Department of Public Expenditure strongly denied that that would be the case.About 120 patients were affected by the cancellation of day care mental health services on Tuesday morning, the HSE has said.Nursing staff who participate in the operation of community mental health services were re-deployed to work in hospitals or in 24-hour hotels where patients are accommodated.On Wednesday and Thursday the Psychiatric Nurses Association is to extend its overtime ban to run for 24 hours.Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show on Tuesday, emergency medicine consultant Dr Fergal Hickey says there was no evidence the Government was addressing the fundamental problems in the health service.He warned both sides will have to move from their entrenched position to negotiate a resolution.Dr Hickey predicted that there would be even more severe problems within the service next week when nurses plan to strike for three days in a row. - Additional reporting: PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3783099.1549385163!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses strike government told substance must replace spin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Ní Sheaghdha, General Secretary INMO, joined members on the picket line outside St. James’s Hospital, in Dublin.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyWPA PoolGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May said her commitment to avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland was “unshakeable”.In a speech in Belfast she said: “I’m here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the UK Government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.” She added that she was committed to the Belfast Agreement and its successors. She said she wanted to “affirm my commitment to delivering a Brexit that ensures no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which is unshakeable”.She acknowledged the importance of a seamless border and how the current arrangements had helped “deliver peace and prosperity”. She said: “While I have said that technology could play a part and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.” Mrs May added: “Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish Government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past. “The UK Government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.” Mrs May said that while she had tried to make the case for the Withdrawal Agreement, she had had to accept it would not get through parliament in its current form. “I fought hard to make the case for the deal as it stands,” she said. “I believed it could command a majority in the House of Commons but I have had to face up to the fact that in its current form it cannot and the need for changes to the backstop is the key issue. “While there were those in Northern Ireland who favoured it, it is also true that the backstop is not supported by the two main Unionist parties here and it also influenced MPs in England, Scotland and Wales in voting against the deal.” Mrs May said she was “determined” to work towards a solution to the Northern Irish border question that can command support from across the country, as she reiterated that there will be no hard border. She said: “I know that the prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the Withdrawal Agreement creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, because it is here that the consequences of whatever is agreed will most be felt. “I recognise too that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain and that many will feel that once again decisions taken in Westminster are having a profound and in many cases unwanted impact in Northern Ireland and Ireland. “So I’m determined to work towards a solution that can command broader support from across the community in Northern Ireland.” Mrs May added: “We stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border — including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls.”Mrs May is to travel to Brussels on Thursday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as she seeks changes to the Brexit deal that was rejected by MPs last month.The British prime minister is expected to press the case for the withdrawal agreement to be reopened to replace the controversial backstop with alternative arrangements for avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.Announcing Mrs May’s planned visit to Brussels, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: “As you know, what we have is a procedure involving a number of votes that have taken place in the UK parliament“On that basis, the prime minister will come along to spell out to us her ideas for what happens next.“President Juncker has been in constant contact with her and will look forward to seeing her . . . to pursue these discussions.“But we have to repeat what you are aware of, that is that the EU’s position, the Commission’s position, is clear that we are awaiting once again to see what the prime minister has to tell us.”It is her first formal meeting with senior EU officials since the deal that she reached with Mr Juncker in November went down to overwhelming defeat in the House of Commons and since MPs voted for the removal of the backstop.On Wednesday Mrs May will hold talks with Northern Ireland’s political leaders including DUP leader Arlene Foster, who has promised to tell the Mrs May the proposed border backstop “drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent” and would effectively create a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.However, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said alternatives to the backstop were “wishful thinking”. He said: “The Irish protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement already allows for alternative arrangements or alternative solutions to the backstop and if they’re there they can replace the backstop. “The problem is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements stand up to scrutiny, we have certainly not seen any that have.”Meanwhile, former North first minister Lord Trimble confirmed he is considering a legal challenge to the backstop over concerns it breaches the Belfast Agreement.Lord Trimble told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We are exploring this possibility, and we are concerned at the way in which the withdrawal agreement that our prime minister agreed actually turns the Belfast Agreement on its head and does serious damage to it.” – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland and that secures a majority in the Westminster parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland,” she is expected to say.In her speech on Tuesday afternoon, Mrs May will call for a renewed effort to restore the Assembly and Executive at Stormont, which have been suspended for more than two years.\u0026nbsp“I\u0026nbsphope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent. For ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Ireland’s history must be more than whether we avoid a return to the challenges of the past,” she is expected to say.\u0026nbspFormer first minister David Trimble said on Monday he was planning to take legal proceedings against the British government to remove the Northern Ireland protocol, including the backstop, from the withdrawal agreement. He believes the protocol is in breach of some provisions of the Belfast Agreement which he helped to negotiate in 1998.Mrs May is seeking to reopen the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU last November after MPs voted last week to support it on condition the backstop is replaced with “alternative measures” to keep the Border open. Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay on Monday started at least three days of talks with Conservative MPs to consider technological and administrative alternatives to the backstop.Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said in Brussels that Ireland and the EU were willing to provide backstop “reassurances and clarity to the UK to assist the Brexit ratification process on the UK side”. But he insisted that alternatives to the backstop had been exhaustively examined and tested.Martin Selmayr, secretary general of the European Commission, rejected reports he had told British MPs the EU would consider legally binding assurances on the withdrawal agreement if it meant the deal would win a majority at Westminster. German chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested a “creative” approach to Brexit talks could see outstanding questions resolved.On a trip to Japan, Dr Merkel said there were “possibilities, no doubt” to maintain the integrity of the single market and avoid checks on the Irish Border.On Dr Merkel’s comments, an Irish Government source said: “She is just saying what the European Commission and Irish Government have said all along.“She herself said the scope for the way forward is in the political declaration, not the withdrawal agreement.”\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Eduardo VerdugoAP After a lengthy 11-week trial in Brooklyn, New York, a jury on Monday began deliberating the case of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo. Guzmán faces 10 charges, including leading a criminal enterprise and the importation and sales of large amounts of narcotics into the United States. If convicted, he faces life in prison.The trial has allowed prosecutors to extensively detail the inner workings of Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel, providing unparalleled insight into international drug trafficking. Here are 11 of the most important takeaways, in no particular order.During the trial, nearly every level of Mexican government was implicated in bribes, including the presidency. One witness testified that El Chapo paid Enrique Peña Nieto, when he was president in 2012, $100 million in exchange for allowing the kingpin to come out of hiding.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s top security official was said by one witness – and federal prosecutors – to have accepted a multimillion-dollar bribe from the Sinaloa cartel in 2005. Genaro García Luna, the former secretary of public security, was accused of accepting two suitcases stuffed with $3 million. And the Mexican federal police, referred to by one witness as “our people”, were said to have protected El Chapo after his first escape from prison in 2001.Getting too much plastic surgery appears to be an unwritten rule in narco textbooks. Drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as the Lord of the Skies, famously died under a surgeon’s knife, and several witnesses said they went through extensive operations.Tirso Martínez Sanchez, who helped run trains filled with drugs between Mexico and the United States for the cartel, said he had several facial-reconstructive operations to drastically alter his appearance, stopping only after he started bleeding out during his third operation.Most memorable were the comic-strip-like features of Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía, known as Chupeta, who was El Chapo’s Colombian cocaine supplier. Over the course of several operations, he structurally altered his jawbone, cheekbone, eyes, mouth, ears and nose.Chupeta also tried to have his fingerprints removed, most likely causing a circulation problem he almost constantly used gloves on the stand. In court, his reddened skin looked like melted wax pulled over his scalp. According to witnesses, El Chapo heavily invested in wiretapping and spyware equipment over the decades, becoming obsessed with secure communications in the 1980s. Around that time, he also began obsessively recording the calls of his wife, lovers, associates and enemies. One associate, Miguel Angel Martínez, recalled El Chapo telling him, “The most important thing in that environment was to know what everyone was thinking about you. Whoever – your friends, our enemies, your compadres.”Later, Christian Rodriguez, a 20-something information technology expert from Colombia, developed a more high-tech spyware system for phones and computers belonging to Guzmán’s wife, mistresses and associates. Guzmán received routine spy reports and also made a habit of calling back associates after a business transaction the second, invisible, call activated hidden microphones that enabled him to listen in without the person’s knowledge.The US government used El Chapo’s intrepid spy systems against him. Although Guzmán used BlackBerry phones as well as a filter system, which passed messages between third parties to protect the identity of the senders, his most comprehensive system was devised by Rodriguez. It allowed him to place calls from a secure three-digit extension to other trusted parties anywhere in the world.Rodriguez, however, agreed to cooperate with US authorities after being approached by the FBI during a sting operation. He turned over calls and text messages from the encrypted system. The prosecution’s case was built from four wiretap investigations. In addition to Rodriguez’s system tap, prosecutors also used wiretaps collected by authorities in Colombia and the Dominican Republic, as well as one from Homeland Security Investigations.The government collected more than 1 million text messages between cartel members. Like any good business, the Sinaloa cartel globalised, stretching far beyond the Mexican-US border to Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Belize, Honduras, Canada, Thailand and China. From early in his career, Guzmán reached out to cocaine suppliers in Colombia to receive cheap cocaine. He negotiated cheaper deals with the dealers by promising to deliver the cocaine more quickly, gaining him the nickname El Rápido for his speed in funnelling the cocaine through tunnels under the border.The case required the co-operation of several US law enforcement agencies, but it also required keeping some Mexican authorities out of most discussions. Among the co-operators were the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations and the coast guard. Also involved were foreign law enforcement and military based in Ecuador, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, as well as local law enforcement in New York City, Chicago and Texas and federal prosecutors in New York Chicago El Paso, Texas Miami San Diego and Washington.But not a single Mexican law enforcement officer testified. Victor J Vazquez, the DEA special agent who helped lead the successful arrest of El Chapo in February 2014, told the jury that the DEA and Mexican military purposely kept local Mexican law enforcement in the dark because of “the corruption level – using them again was not going to work”.El Chapo loves the limelight – even his lawyers admit it. Guzmán wanted to direct a movie, and then later tried to set up another movie with the telenovela star Kate del Castillo. That contact led to his infamous interview with Sean Penn for Rolling Stone.And in court, El Chapo seemed ecstatic to see actor Alejandro Edda, who plays him on Netflix’s Narcos: Mexico. The cartel was not a cohesive unit, but an ever-shifting factionalised federation constantly at war with itself. Guzmán has feuded with his cousins, the Beltrán-Leyva brothers the Arellano-Félix organisation and other former close associates.Deaths of leaders and close friends often sparked the wars, which led to the bloody deaths and injuries of innocent civilians and family members in public places, including the 1993 murder of Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo at an airport in Guadalajara.Guzmán’s drugs came into Mexico and later the United States on fishing boats and trains, helicopters and planes, semi-submersible and tanker ships, shoe boxes and chilli cans. Although many more drugs crossed over than were seized, a few notable successes for authorities included a 16-tonne seizure from a merchant vessel in Panama and a six-tonne seizure out of Ecuador.Although it never happened, the cartel also discussed trying to move 100 tonnes of cocaine on an oil tanker ship. In documents unsealed Friday, one witness alleged that El Chapo routinely raped young girls, preferring 13-year-olds whom he considered “his vitamins”. He was also accused of raping a young woman, who testified against him in court. That woman, Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, was believed to be his former lover and sobbed on the stand while recounting her affair with the kingpin. Evidence about these attacks, kept from the jury because it was considered prejudicial, was published just before deliberations. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignRussia to develop nuclear missiles by 2021 following end of treaty with USAlcohol-related admissions among baby boomers soar as millennials turn their back on drink Duchess of Cambridge tells students: \u0026#39This is what you can do when you’re not on social media\u0026#39German grannies take to the streets in stand against far-RightRAF\u0026#39s Tornado jets return home for the final time after 40 years of serviceBrexit latest news: Theresa May rules out scrapping backstop ahead of showdown talks with Jean-Claude JunckerVenice tourist tax to be introduced in May but criticised by Italian minister as \u0026#39useless and damaging\u0026#39Four children under eight killed in house fire in Stafford as father \u0026#39leaps from window with baby\u0026#39 Chinese New Year 2019: Pigs, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenListen: Seven-year-old boy\u0026#39s \u0026#39brave\u0026#39 call to 999 after his mum collapses Boyfriend left Holby City actor John Michie\u0026#39s daughter to die of drug overdose because he didn\u0026#39t want to be arrested, court hearsHawaii considers raising legal smoking age -

Feb 5, 2019. Defence and Security CorrespondentAfter almost 40 years serving the UK on military operations across the world, iconic RAF Tornado jets have returned home for the final time.The stalwart of Britain’s bomber force since the days of the Cold War carried out its last operational strike on January 26, when a pair of Tornados hit five positions in Syria, all of which were being used by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil).The last operational sortie by Tornado GR4s was on January 31. Two Tornados flew an uneventful patrol over Syria, recovering safely to base at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus after a mission lasting six and a half hours.First entering service in 1979, the fast jets have been used in operations across the world, most recently bombarding Isil to push the terrorist group back through Syria and Iraq.Families and friends of the present-day squadron members were on hand to welcome them back to RAF Marham, Norfolk, on Tuesday afternoon.RAF groundcrew marshal the aircrew of the Tornado GR4 for a sortie for the last time at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The weapons capabilities of the soon-to-retire Tornados are now being delivered by RAF Typhoon jets, which will continue to take a leading role in the Coalition’s mission against Isil. Under ‘Project Centurion’, worth £425million over the past three years, the Typhoon can now also launch the Meteor air-to-air missile, the Stormshadow deep strike cruise missile and the precision attack missile Brimstone.These improved RAF Typhoon jets will form the backbone of the UK’s combat air fleet in the future, alongside the recently introduced new fleet of F-35 Lighting jets.The Tornado will be officially retired from service at the end of March and will only be used for training purposes over the UK in the intervening period.Originally named the Tornado GR1 the aircraft’s first use in live operations was during the Gulf War in 1991, when 60 Tornado GR1s were deployed from bases in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Later they were upgraded to the GR4 model, which has been used ever since over the skies of Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “It is with a heavy heart, but enormous pride, that we bid farewell to the Tornado from operations. This truly is the end of an era, having played a vital role in keeping Britain and its allies safe for four decades.“But, after so long in service, it is only right that we now look to the future. The combination of our state-of-the art F35s and the Typhoon’s new weapon systems will keep us as a world leader in air combat for a generation.”Some of the last Tornado missions were in support of Iraqi security forces in their operations to prevent Isil re-establishing a foothold in the country.  An important part of this work was the ability to destroy terrorist stockpiles of weapons and other equipment concealed in remote areas of the countryside.  In January two RAF Tornados dropped a pair of Paveway IV guided bombs which successfully collapsed the entrance to a cave, 55 miles south-east of Kirkuk, where one such stockpile was known to be stored.Also in January, Tornados destroyed a truck-bomb facility to the north-east of Abu Kamal, Syria, and cratered a road leading towards the Syrian Defence Force locations.  One of the Paveway bombs used to crater the road caused a secondary explosion, indicating that Isil had probably planted a booby-trap at that location.Aircrew dismount from their Tornado GR4 after landing for the last time at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.Speaking at RAF Marham, Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: “As a Tornado GR4 pilot myself, I have seen the aircraft develop over its nearly 40 years of service into an outstanding combat aircraft, flown, maintained and supported by similarly outstanding air and groundcrew.  “The Tornado Force has been continuously deployed on operations since 1990, serving with immense distinction in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and the Balkans.  “I will personally be very sad to see the Tornado retire, but it is time now to pass the baton to our next generation combat aircraft.  The F-35B Lightning is now operational and the Typhoon is now fully multi-role capable and able to take on the Tornado’s missions.Please review our commenting policyRussia to develop nuclear missiles by 2021 following end of treaty with USAlcohol-related admissions among baby boomers soar as millennials turn their back on drink Duchess of Cambridge tells students: \u0026#39This is what you can do when you’re not on social media\u0026#39German grannies take to the streets in stand against far-RightBrexit latest news: Theresa May rules out scrapping backstop ahead of showdown talks with Jean-Claude JunckerVenice tourist tax to be introduced in May but criticised by Italian minister as \u0026#39useless and damaging\u0026#39Four children under eight killed in house fire in Stafford as father \u0026#39leaps from window with baby\u0026#39 Chinese New Year 2019: Pigs, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenListen: Seven-year-old boy\u0026#39s \u0026#39brave\u0026#39 call to 999 after his mum collapses Boyfriend left Holby City actor John Michie\u0026#39s daughter to die of drug overdose because he didn\u0026#39t want to be arrested, court hearsHawaii considers raising legal smoking age - to 100Liam Neeson insists he is \u0026#39not racist\u0026#39 after admitting wish to kill a \u0026#39black b-----d\u0026#39 because of rape of his friendComment: Corbyn fans have received another reminder of what everyone else knew - he has opposed the EU all his lifeEx-RSPB officer condemned for \u0026#39sexist\u0026#39 bird watch talk that compared sparrows to prostitutesVillage of widows: the volleyball playing town devastated by a suicide bombingJapanese minister apologises for blaming childless people for declining populationSir Nick Clegg summoned in front of MPs to answer questions on abuse of politiciansGM mosquitoes: playing with God or the only way to wipe out malaria?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/28/12/oscars.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6810496  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Scroll through for every single Best Picture winner there has ever been  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/28/12/oscars.jpg","title":"benjamin simon amstell trailer film release date cast colin morgan london","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain.

We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch.

His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Serbian guard commanders say they will open fire if they do. It’s Alex’s first operation and his group is vastly outnumbered on either side and so can’t physically drive the warring factions apart.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Over 48 hours we had to persuade the Kosovans not to attempt a border break and the Serbians not to shoot,” he says. “I had my troops and the Serbians looking to me. I had to keep strong. I had to keep alert and focus on the end result.”The Serbians didn’t shoot and the Kosovans retreated, teaching him the importance of keeping calm which probably isn’t taught in business studies courses but really should be.After seven years of service, which included further tours of Macedonia and Iraq, Alex returned to his native Inverness and in 2015 set up a breakfast cereal business called FUEL10K, hoping to capitalise on the trend among younger customers to ditch conventional square boxed options.His 32-strong product range includes drinks in squeezable pouches, porridge pots and cookies and are stocked in Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Waitrose. Every year has seen double digit growth with sales now at £8m this year and expected to hit £10m next, all from a standing start and no outside investment. Last year he was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Heropreneurs, an organisation encouraging armed forces veterans to go into business on return to civilian life.The encouraging reality of corporate social responsibilityIt’s often said we can judge a country by how well it treats its prisoners. But how we treat our veterans is equally revealing, perhaps more so, given around 4 per cent of the prison population is made up of ex-military.Alex’s journey is a remarkable one, sadly not shared by many. Having worked with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress for a number of years, I’ve heard too many stories of returning servicemen being unprepared to come back to what they left often many years ago, beginning a cycle of family breakdown, homelessness, alcoholism, drugs, crime and imprisonment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means for many their only weekly activity is a counselling session.Sometimes crime and homelessness are ing factors to join the armed forces in the first place.“By the time I joined the army aged 21, I had lived on the streets aged 16, ran my first business, been on the run from the police for defrauding banks and catalogues, done drugs and employed a drug dealer,” Nick Wilson tells me.In the army he found he had a family who always looked out for each other. But in 2013, on return, he set up a chauffeur company which, while successful, left him with the feeling that many business owners face of isolation: “What got me through the really bad times was that sense of survival – knowing real hard times, horrendous, shit situations experienced whilst on operational tour, those that put life in perspective. The gritted, dogged determination that you needed to get through those days, weeks, months is what will get you through business.”After two years Nick sold his business for a profit just around the time he was diagnosed with PTSD. “I was having suicidal thoughts, the pain from my spinal injury was becoming a real problem with the meds and their side-effects causing me to lose grip on reality.”In 2016 he suffered a nervous breakdown but after rehabilitation was determined not to let mental health issues ruin his life. He set up Working Minds Matter – a consultancy firm helping business with mental wellbeing in the workplace.“I think it is important for a veteran who is looking to go into business for themselves to have a better understanding of who they are as a person, what makes them who they are, their values, their beliefs, their strengths and weaknesses. They are no longer a part of a large family unit, having to follow another leader or manager, working for an organisation’s values and beliefs rather than those of their own.”I first met Nick at an event Dragons Den star Peter Jones organised last summer at Buckingham University where 20 businesspeople speed mentored hundreds of schoolkids from around the country who all had entrepreneurial dreams.Our collective worry was that the education system would slowly sap that out of them. I observed\u0026nbspto Nick was that the army instils leadership skills and\u0026nbspI was surprised that there weren’t more veteran-owned businesses.Nick\u0026nbspthen put out a competition to his network to a make a short video presentation of their emerging or aspirant business idea and the most compelling one would win a year’s mentoring with me.Created with Sketch.The new army recruitment posters Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The winner, Rob Dennison, joined the army in 2004, serving partly in Afghanistan. He still has recurring nightmares from when he visited the Helmand Province where he came across a child prostitution racket with many children lying dead. “When I returned I realised I’d gone from a high adrenalin career to nothing,” he says.He told his girlfriend that once he’d got into trouble for brewing some coffee when out on patrol and she convinced him to start his own coffee business which he’s called The 50cal Coffee Company. It will be a social enterprise – a series of cafes where veterans can not only get his own blends and brews but also have the opportunity to talk to someone in private about the problems they are facing, starting in his home town of Lincoln.In America there is much bigger public support for veterans and veteran-owned businesses than we have here. I’m hoping my year with Rob will help him get off the ground and get wider buy-in from the rest of us.It’s not just about what people like Alex, Nick and Rob have done for us in their past in the services but also for what they are able to do for us in the next phase of their lives.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They also pointed to downturns in activity in 1998, 2001 and 2003 that failed to materialise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There will be an option to report people to avoid users sending then removing harmful messages, for instance.It mirrors a tool that is available in other apps including Facebook\u0027s own WhatsApp. On that app, messages can be deleted for much longer after they are sent, allowing people more than an hour – though it was much shorter initially.Mark Zuckerberg tries to defend Facebook on its birthdayMark Zuckerberg has also had access to a similar feature for some time. Facebook claims the boss\u0027s messages disappear over time to ensure they are kept safing, citing security issues such as the major Sony hack.But users complained that it appeared to be unfair that only they were given the option of deleting messages after the fact. When it became clear Mr Zuckerberg was receiving special treatment, the company announced he would have limited access to the feature that and that such a tool would be rolled out in the coming months.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macro approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-pledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s sweat and purpose and promiseI’m struck by this naming and shaming, by the identification of supposed disloyalty, clearly marking the public space of the city for all to see, whether they care or not, whether they know or notA view from inside the Market Hall, looking out, onto another person sitting on the street and another person faced with the experience of walking by. Both lower their heads, as if in acknowledgement of the difficulty of the situationI walk to the end of a long jetty by the marina.

Some things just cannot be appreciated at ground level and can only be seen from aboveSomebody once wrote this on a wall. That’s all. But now it’s part of the scene, part of the view, part of the experience of walking up High Street West into town.

It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureNetflix’s “mind-blowing” new series Russian Doll has won rave reviews, with Natasha Lyonne’s performance and writing being praised by critics.Russian Doll centres on\u0026nbspNadiya – played by\u0026nbspLyonne – who dies over and over again, only to re-appear every time in the same place: in the bathroom at her birthday party. (Unsurprisingly, the premise has been liked to the film\u0026nbspGroundhog Day.)After reaching the streaming service on Friday (1 February), subscribers took to Twitter to discuss the “trippy” series.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Just binged watched Russian Doll,” wrote one.\u0026nbsp”The whole season. Really worth the effn wild ride. Super Trippy. Major surprises.”Another wrote: “Wow. Russian Doll is the best series I’ve watched in a long time.”“I loved it,” one social media user wrote.\u0026nbsp”I watched it all and I wish there was more. It’s smart. It’s female empowerment and mental-health aware. It’s everything I wanted.”Critics have likewise written highly of the series, with Russian Doll currently holding a 100 per cent fresh rating on the aggregate website\u0026nbspRotten Tomatoes.\u0026nbsp“As the series proceeds, it gets more ambitious and more complicated in a way that’s gratifying to watch,” writes\u0026nbspSophie Gilbert for The Atlantic.\u0026nbsp”It’s still anchored, though, by its sense of place and time, and by the infinite possibilities that a night walking around New York City presents.”Joel Keller for Decider writes: “Lyonne puts on the performance of her career in this funny, emotional series.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

It crossed the international date line in 2017 in its lurch eastwards.As a result, scientists have been forced to issue an update on the status of Earth’s magnetic field a year ahead of schedule to enable precise navigation by those that depend on compasses rather than GPS navigation.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe constant roaming of the pole is a problem for compasses in smartphones and some consumer electronics. Aeroplanes and boats also rely on magnetic north, usually as backup navigation, said University of Colorado geophysicist Arnaud Chulliat, lead author of the newly issued World Magnetic Model. GPS is not affected because it is satellite-based. The movement of the magnetic north pole “is pretty fast”, Dr Chulliat said. Arctic summers at hottest temperatures for 115,000 years, study revealSuperbugs found in one of last ‘pristine’ Arctic wildernessesUnited Airlines’ 26-hour flight via the Arctic: What really happenedTrump reveals plans to open pristine Arctic refuge to oil drilling The shift in the pole’s location is felt more keenly in the Arctic around the north pole, meaning any vessels in the region would be hardest hit by an inaccurate model.Military organisations often depend on where magnetic north is for navigation and parachute drops, while Nasa, the Federal Aviation Administration and the US Forest Service also use it.Airport runway names are based on their direction toward magnetic north and their names change when the poles moved. For example, the airport in Fairbanks, Alaska, renamed a runway 1L-19R to 2L-20R in 2009. Modern navigation systems use declination - the difference between true north and where a compass points - to help correct where they are pointing. Declination depends on accurate magnetic field models.Scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration along with those at the British Geological Survey tend to update the location of the magnetic north pole every five years in December, but this update came early because of the pole\u0027s faster movement.The early update had been scheduled for release in January this year, but was delayed by Donald Trump’s US government shutdown.Since 1831 when magnetic North was first measured in the Canadian Arctic it has moved about 1,400 miles (2300 kilometers) toward Siberia. Its speed jumped from about 9mph (15kph) to 34mph (55 kph) since 2000. The reason the pole is not static is due to movement and turbulence in Earth\u0027s liquid outer core. The molten ocean of iron and nickel in the planet\u0027s core generates an electric field, which moves around gradually, but sometimes unpredictably.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field found“It has changes akin to weather,” said University of Maryland geophysicist Daniel Lathrop, who was not part of the team monitoring the magnetic north pole. “We might just call it magnetic weather.”The magnetic south pole is moving much slower than the north. Earth\u0027s magnetic field is getting weaker around our planet, leading scientists to suggest the north and south poles will eventually swap polarity, like a bar magnet flipping over. It has happened numerous times in the past, but not in the last 780,000 years. “It\u0027s not a question of if it\u0027s going to reverse, the question is when it\u0027s going to reverse,” Professor Lathrop said. When it reverses, it will not be an instantaneous inversion, but will take 1,000 or more years, scientists believe. Professor Lathrop said he sees a flip coming sooner rather than later because of the weakened magnetic field and because an area over the South Atlantic has already reversed beneath Earth\u0027s surface.

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But the Home Office has not indicated it\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphalt their deportation so they can attend.The two men told The Independent they believed the Home Office was intentionally trying to move witnesses ahead of the inquest into the death of their\u0026nbspfriend. They said they had “strong evidence” that his death could have been prevented.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionHow the Windrush scandal forced Brexit off the front pagesThree Windrush victims flown back to live in UK after ‘urgent’ helpDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushMr Richards, who has been in the UK for 21 years and has a partner and four British children,\u0026nbspsaid: “They’re tampering with witnesses. I’m 120 per cent sure that they’re trying to get rid of us because of this case against the Home Office. They’re interfering.”The 47-year-old, who was convicted of assault in 2010 for which he\u0026nbspspent 14 months in prison, and was detained and issued the deportation notice last week, said: “They are fixing it up the way they want it. They’re trying to remove the witnesses.\u0026nbspIt should not be allowed.“I want to tell Carlington’s wife and his little kids the truth.\u0026nbspOur case against them is very strong. We took notes and recorded stuff.”Mr Richards’ solicitor, Imogen Townley of Wilson Solicitors LLP, said that as the Home Office had not confirmed that they had deferred his removal following the witness summons from the coroner, she had been forced to take\u0026nbspthe “extreme” measure of lodging an application for judicial review to the High Court.\u0026nbspShe said the Home Office had known Mr Richards was a potential witness “for months” yet still listed him for deportation on the charter flight, in a move that “risked obscuring access to justice”.“The Home Office should be proactively investigating how Mr Spencer died at Morton Hall. They are\u0026nbspthe public body alleged to have caused or contributed to his death, and yet instead of taking this positive proactive role in investigating, they are bundling the witnesses off on a secretive charter flight,” she said.“The worst thing about it is that it\u0026nbspindicates that they’re not committed to the inquest and to ensuring justice for\u0026nbspCarlington Spencer’s family. It’s a breach of the right to life which states that deaths must be properly investigated.\u0026nbsp“Detention centres are incredibly closed environments, and the fact that there are detainees who are able and willing to speak and give evidence to the coroner is something that we benefit from and we shouldn’t be trying to silence them and prevent them giving their testimony.”Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe other witness, Mr Nembhard, who moved to the UK from Jamaica at the age of 18 and has a wife who is 23 weeks pregnant, as well as a four-year-old daughter, said he felt he was being “silenced” by the Home Office.“They are suggesting that if I go to Jamaica I can take part over the internet. I’m not saying it’s not possible, but between now and then is the Home Office going to guarantee I’ll still be alive, or that they’ll be able to find me?” he said.“When you’re in a country where life is hard, it’s easy to lose your phone, to lose your contacts.“I’m being silenced. They are quickly trying to get me on the flight. It’s because we wrote down everything that happened and sent it to the relevant authorities.”Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, which supports families of people who have died\u0026nbspin custody,\u0026nbspsaid it was “alarming” that inquest witnesses were at risk of being deported.“Obstructing key witnesses from giving evidence significantly undermines the investigative function of the inquest to get to the truth and expose any wrongdoing,” she said.“The Home Office and other persons responsible for Carlington’s care must be effectively scrutinised and held accountable for future deaths to be prevented. We have to question whether this is an attempt to frustrate the inquest process.”When asked\u0026nbspwhether they would prevent the two witnesses from being deported, a Home Office spokesperson said it did not comment on inidual cases.“It is only right that we seek to deport foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK,” the spokesperson said. “This ensures we keep the public safe. All iniduals on this charter flight are serious criminals.”Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Another was scheduled to leave last April, days after the Windrush scandal broke, with a 63-year-old grandmother among the deportees, but it was cancelled for reasons the Home Office did not disclose.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Upholding the principles of the Good Friday AgreementTheresa May says she accepted the need for an insurance policy or bridging arrangement to guarantee no hard border if the future relationship was not in place in time - in other words, the backstop.\u0026nbspShe says she believed her deal could secure the support of Parliament but has had to accept\u0026nbspthat in its current form it cannot.\u0026nbspThe prime minister admits\u0026nbspit is now clear that she will only secure support for a withdrawal deal if changes are made to the backstop.Theresa May says the Good Friday Agreement was successful in allowing people of different traditions to feel that those traditions and their identities were protected.\u0026nbspShe says the principles in the Agreement will forever be honoured\u0026nbspby the United Kingdom government.\u0026nbspShe is a fierce unionist, she ways, but wants an open and tolerant\u0026nbspunion of nations and people.Theresa May is now speaking In Belfast.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says she sees it as one of her most profound responsibilities to preserve peace in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt is the Northern Ireland parties, civil society groups and the public that have done the most to protect\u0026nbspthe peace agreement, she says.Theresa May is set to deliver her speech in Belfast at around 3pm on Brexit.\u0026nbspHere is an extract from the speech Downing Street sent to journalists on Monday\u0026nbsp“I know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland.\u0026nbsp“But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland…\u0026nbsp“…that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland…\u0026nbsp“…and that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.\u0026nbsp“As we do so, I hope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent.\u0026nbsp“For ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Ireland’s history must be more than whether we avoid a return to the challenges of the past.\u0026nbsp“It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future.\u0026nbsp“As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it is a profound honour and duty to play my part in shaping that future…\u0026nbsp“…and to do my utmost to support the peace, prosperity and progress that can give the people of Northern Ireland, the brightest future for generations.”This is from the Press Association as a peer recalls one of his memories with the former Labour prime minister, Tony Blair.\u0026nbspTony Blair spent most of the time looking out the window during meetings with Scottish Government leaders, a Lord has said.Giving evidence to Westminster\u0027s Scottish Affairs Committee on the relationship between the UK and Scottish Governments, Lord Wallace said the daydreaming occurred during Joint Ministerial Committees (JMCs).The Liberal Democrat peer, who was Scotland\u0027s deputy first minister from Scottish devolution until 2005, with short spells as interim first minister, questioned the formal inter-governmental machinery at the time.JMC meetings involve devolved government leaders along with those of the UK Government.Lord Wallace said: The Joint Ministerial Committee as it were at the top level of Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, First Minister, Deputy First Minister.I remember meeting in Edinburgh, in Cardiff and by the time it came to the third meeting in Downing Street, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m exaggerating to say that Tony Blair spent most of the time looking out the window.But actually, nothing much was achieved at them.You were failing to understand the point of them and that\u0027s when they fell away and I think they were only revived after the Scottish National Party came to office in Edinburgh - where there\u0027s perhaps arguably a greater need for them.Theresa May told the cabinet this morning that the government is carrying out urgent work to find an alternative to the backstop.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0027s official spokesman told a briefing for Westminster journalists:\u0026nbspCabinet agreed that it was positive that, for the first time, Parliament had indicated that it could support the withdrawal agreement, subject to changes to the backstop, and that it had reiterated its commitment to both avoiding a hard border and leaving the EU with a deal.The prime minister said that our objective now is to secure a legally-binding way of guaranteeing we cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.To achieve this, we have launched urgent pieces of work examining alternative arrangements to the backstop and considering legal changes that could provide a unilateral exit mechanism or a time limit to the backstop.The PM said the discussions with the EU will not be easy, but parliament has sent a clear message that a change to the backstop is the only way to get a deal approved.The PM added that last week showed that a second referendum does not have the support of the House.She said that, while Labour did not whip for the Brady amendment, Jeremy Corbyn has said he also has concerns about the backstop, so this is an issue that needs to be resolved not just for our colleagues, by which the prime minister obviously meant Conservative colleagues, and the DUP, but for MPs across the House.Ouch. Labour MP Janet Daby says she\u0026nbspfinds the Home Secretary\u0027s tone most disturbing...I feel\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbsphe sounds like Enoch Powell in re-incarnation.\u0026nbspSajid Javid says she has chosen to lower the tone of this debate.In the Commons chamber, Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, highlights a very damning report by the National Audit Office on ongoing Home Office immigration practices.\u0026nbspShe says the government must publish a full response to the report that recognises the serious anxiety that there is that many of those failings around the Windrush situation are continuing today.\u0026nbspSajid Javid says only that he is looking carefully at the report.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSajid Javid tells MPs that none of the people being deported to Jamaica in the coming days are British citizens and none are members of the Windrush generation.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbspThe flight in question is a flight to\u0026nbspJamaica. Every single person\u0026nbspthat will be on that flight that is being deported is a foreign national offender. They are all convicted of very serious crimes - things like rape\u0026nbspand murder, firearms offences, drug trafficking.\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspare required under the law, quite correctly, to deport anyone who has such a serious conviction, and this law applies universally to any foreign national offender.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

it\u0027s been called an insurance policy, the backstop.”Ms May said it would ensure that if a trade deal was “not in place by the end of the implementation period there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border”.Nissan has been betrayed by Brexit ideologues like Jacob Rees-MoggUK car registrations fall for fifth consecutive monthPost-referendum crime wave \u0027left people suicidal and afraid to go out\u0027Brexit department spent £45,000 printing copies of PM\u0027s dealBut one prominent Brexiteer Tory, John Whittingdale, reacted to Ms May’s comments by pointing out she had set up a “working party” to explore ideas that “would not need the backstop”.“That’s the kind of alternative that it is in the interest, not just of Northern Ireland, but the United Kingdom as a whole,” he said.The prime minister will set out her ideas in Brussels on Thursday, where she will meet both Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the European Commission and Council respectively.The prime minister also dismissed a threatened legal challenge against her Brexit deal by former Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, on the grounds the backstop would breach the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

aid package for Nissan to build new cars in the UK after Brexit, after insisting there had been no “special deal”.Greg Clark, the business secretary, came under fire as he announced the Japanese giant would have to reapply for the cash, after its shock decision to abandon production of the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant.A letter revealing the package – originally set to be up to £80m – was finally released, but only “after the press had got hold of it”, senior Conservative MP Nicky Morgan protested.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free

May’s deputy spokesperson had insisted\u0026nbsp“there was no special deal for Nissan”.Labour said the letter also revealed “strong assurances that manufacturers would still be able to trade without barriers” – pledges broken, it said, by the prime minister’s determination to leave the EU customs union.‘Nobody’ in Brussels considering giving May concessions she needsEloise Todd, the head of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “This Brexit bribe has come back to bite the government.”Ms Morgan, writing in her capacity as the Conservative chairwoman of the Treasury select committee, demanded to know why Mr Clark had kept secret “direct financial assistance from the government to Nissan”.“How much of the £61m is not going to be paid over?” she asked, during a Commons statement on the controversy.Ms Morgan also demanded to know why Nissan had apparently been allowed to “decide that something is still commercially sensitive, two years after the event”.Created with Sketch.Brexit

response, Mr Clark revealed that only £2.6m had been paid out so far – “about half for training of the workforce and half for environmental improvements to the plant”.And he told MPs: “Of course, the company will need to resubmit on the grounds of the new information that it has.”That new information, which emerged over the weekend, is that production of the X-Trail will be moved back to Japan, a decision partly caused by the Brexit crisis, the company said.The decision is a further blow to the UK car industry, following recent moves by Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda to reduce their workforces and cut costs.Mr Clark said the decision meant that 741 planned extra jobs would no longer be created at Sunderland – although there were “no implications for existing jobs”.Pro-Brexit Tory MP refuses to back down over false Twitter claimWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?UK ports to wave through EU goods without checks after no-deal BrexitWhat is the Malthouse compromise and will it solve the Brexit puzzle?Mr Clark, who has hinted he will resign if the UK looks like crashing out of the EU without an agreement, added: “No deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects.”The controversy blew up on a day when:* It was announced that UK ports will wave through goods from the EU without checks if there is a no-deal Brexit, to avoid huge traffic jams.* It was revealed that the prime minister will hold talks with business leaders in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and its political leaders the following day.* Lord Trimble, the former Northern Ireland first minister threatened to take the government to court over the Irish backstop, claiming a breach of the Good Friday Agreement.* Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, raised hopes in Downing Street by saying a Brexit deal could be agreed if people were “creative” and if “there’s enough good will”.* A poll found that 45 per cent of voters back delaying Brexit beyond the scheduled date of 29 March to allow time to negotiate a better deal.Mr Clark defended the secrecy on the grounds that Nissan had been promised the aid would only be revealed “when the company said it was no longer commercially sensitive”.It was offered in return for a decision to build the Qashqhai and X-Trail models at the flagship northeast plant. The first car will still be built there.At the time, Mr Clark had said: “There is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of planning “managed decline’, saying: “Of course Brexit was not the only reason but it was pretty prominent in Nissan’s decision.”She said Mr Clark’s “quiet opposition to no-deal Brexit is of course well known, but still the juggernaut of government chaos hurtles on.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.“The last three months have seen the economy slip into its weakest growth spell for six years, and indicate that GDP likely stagnated at the start of 2019 after eking out modest growth of just 0.1 per cent\u0026nbspin the fourth quarter.”Duncan Brock of the\u0026nbspChartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, which sponsors the survey, said Brexit was the main culprit.“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Brexit uncertainty continues to be at the\u0026nbspheart of the malaise as clients delayed orders and consumers were deeply reluctant to spend under the continuing cloud of hesitation, indecision and ambiguity.”The PMI for the sector\u0026nbspcovers businesses such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.It also showed that in January services firms reduced jobs for the first time since 2012.UK GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2018. The figure for the final quarter, released next week, is expected to show a slump to 0.2 per cent.The PMIs for January are consistent, on a historic basis, with flatlining GDP in the first quarter of 2019.Fifth of big firms have already moved operations abroad due to BrexitSome analysts said that might be misleading, however.“Since 2004, the rate of GDP growth implied by the PMIs has been wide of the mark by an average of 0.3 percentage points,” said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon.“They were far too downbeat immediately after the referendum, suggesting that they tend to overstate the impact of political uncertainty on the economy. They also pointed to downturns in activity in 1998, 2001 and 2003 that failed to materialise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all. This week’s amendment, co-signed by Boles and Yvette Cooper, could have holed the whole operation below the waterline.But that does not mean he should be deselected. The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be the last thing I would do.But hey, this is my holiday as well that I paid two grand for. I paid for a full seat, I didnt pay for half of your seat. Its TUIs problem to sort this out and do something about this.My contract with TUI was for a certain size of seat. A -inch seat pitch I think it was, with a -inch width. Thats what I didnt get.For the next two or three days I had pains in my shoulder and neck. Im not silly, I did get up and walk around, but I wasnt comfortable for the next two or three days of my holiday.Since then I have had a blood clot in my lungs.I spoke to my doctor at the hospital and he said it was a possibility that it was caused by the armrest, but we will never know.Margaret said she fears for the welfare of herself and other passengers when seated next to an overweight flyer having researched safety rules.She said: What concerns me is the armrest couldnt be lowered, highered or moved at all during any time in the flight - including takeoff and landing.Ive looked into this and Newtons law, to quote something, says that it can cause serious bodily damagethere is an emergency landing and the armrest isnt down.Plus the fact that I couldnt get my table down properly to eat off because the tops of her legs and stomach came out and interfered with my space.You wouldnt believe it. She must have been about  stone. Im no skinny person, Im a size  , but I fit quite comfortably into a seat.I have all sympathy with people that have obesity for medical reasons but also why should we pay for it I know its a sensitive issue but Im sorry, embarrassment doesnt come more important than my safety. Thats my main gripe.I would like for them to put passengers safety above passengers embarrassment.Margaret said she politely asked the passenger to move but was left frustrated as the woman didnt want to move away from her husband.The pensioner, who once worked as a holiday tour manager, said: I spoke to her on the flight. We booked aisle seats so we would get a bit of extra room. On this row of three was myself, this big lady in the middle and her friend who was quite tiny.I said to her about two hours into the flight Im not being rude but wouldnt you be more comfortableyou sat on the end and swapped with your friend .She said Ive already asked her that but she wont swap with me.I thought, shes a nice friend. She would have been fine sitting in the middle. She was a tiny one, about size  or .She knew about the armrest. She knew we couldnt get it down. I spoke to the cabin crew very discreetly but Im sure she did know.They didnt say a word to her. When they spoke to me they bent down quite low and whispered to me. They were fully aware that they didnt want to embarrass her.Margaret paid £ to upgrade to new seats on theflight, after finding out she would also be sat next to the woman on the London-bound flight.In a letter to her, TUI said: We are voluntarily in a position where we do not discriminate against passengers in any way.The crew on board would not have addressed the issue with the guest for these reasons, along with protecting the dignity and respect of that guest.However she is still unhappy that she only got two thirds of the seat she paid for on the outbound flight and that the company have not addressed her concerns for passenger safety when sat next to overweight people.A TUI UK spokesperson said: We were sorry to hear about this case.When we were first contacted about it we issued a refund to the customer.

This in turn increases the risk of glaucoma, retinal tears and even detachment.Mr Allamby said the concern was the growing risk of Brits developing problems at a younger age. “The younger these problems start, the more serious they become at a later date.”Experts warn that modern lestyles – at-desk working and a lack of daylight – has led to a sharp rise in eyesight issues around the world.Nearly  per cent of  year-old conscripts in South Korea were found to have myopia.The Sun on Saturday revealed Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies will recommend limiting kids to two-hours-a-time on their devices.Schools Minister Nick Gibb has also separately called for a ban on pupils taking smartphones into school.Digital Minister Margot James is also later today expected to confirm a bid to force social media firms by law to sign a code of conduct protecting young and vulnerable users."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000466743074.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"raf tornado jets fly last time defending britain","story":"They are due to be replaced by Typhoons after spending  years defending Britain.After entering service in  the jets have been used all over the world - most recently bombing Isis with missiles to push the terrorist group back through Syria and Iraq.Squadron members were welcomed back by family and friends as they landed this afternoon at RAF Marham, Norfolk.Originally named the Tornado GR the aircraft’s first use in live operations was during the Gulf War in , when  Tornado GRs were deployed from bases in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.Later they were upgraded to the GR model, which has been used ever since over the skies of Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.From now on they will only be used for training purposes over the UK, before the Typhoons officially take on the mantle in March.The new and improved RAF jets will make up the backbone of the UKs combat airfleet - joining the new fleet of F- Lightning jets.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: It is with a heavy heart, but enormous pride, that we bid farewell to the Tornado from operations.This truly is the end of an era, having played a vital role in keeping Britain and its allies safe for four decades.They are flexible when flying with a mm gun for ied targets.The aircraft carry Paveway guided bombs and Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles.They can reach top speeds of Mach . and fly to an altitude of ,ft.A Tornados wingspan is ftin and the jet is ftins in .But, after so long in service, it is only right that we now look to the future.The combination of our state-of-the art Fs and the Typhoon’s new weapon systems will keep us as a world leader in air combat for a generation.Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: My sincerest congratulations to the Tornado Force, ing home after more than  years of continuous commitment to defeating Daesh in Iraq and Syria - an exceptional effort from everyone, well done and thank you.As a Tornado GR pilot myself, I have seen the aircraft develop over its nearly  years of service into an outstanding combat aircraft, flown, maintained and supported by similarly outstanding air and groundcrew.The Tornado Force has been continuously deployed on operations since , serving with immense distinction in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and the Balkans.I will personally be very sad to see the Tornado retire, but it is time now to pass the baton to our next generation combat aircraft.The F-B Lightning is now operational and the Typhoon is now fully multi-role capable and able to take on the Tornado’s missions.We can all take immense pride in what the Tornado has achieved in defence of the nation over nearly four decades, and reflect back on the courage, commitment and achievements of everyone who has contributed to the success of this extraordinary aircraft.The RAF has already trialled its Typhoon and F- Forces’ abilities to work together.In a series of trials, the effectiveness of both s when operating alongside one another has been confirmed.With its larger payload and increased agility and range, the Typhoon will operate in concert with the stealthy F- and its next-generation sensors, delivering the UK a force ready to counter evolving threats in the global environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449179396.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit leave eu march 29 2019 deal chequers theresa may latest","story":"Theresa May is now fighting to stay on top after multiple votes eroded her vision of Brexit. Heres the latest on Britains departure from the EU.Brexit comes from merging the words Britain and exit.The term has been widely used ever since the idea of a referendum on leaving the EU was put forward.More than million people voted in the June  referendum with a turnout of . per cent. Leave won by  per cent to  per cent.People now talk about “soft” and “hard” Brexit in reference to how close the UK will be to the EU post separation.The road to triggering Article  — which saw Britain officially start the process of leaving the EU — was paved with complications for the PM, including a Supreme Court case ruling MPs needed to vote on Brexit negotiations.But it was finally triggered on March , , meaning the official departure date and move into the transition phase is due to take place on March , .The European Union is an economic and political partnership. There are currently  members states including the United Kingdom.It began as a trade group of six nations in the s.The UK first applied to join what was then the European Economic Community in  and finally became a member in .Now called the European Union, it has grown to include former Soviet bloc states and has at its heart a “single market” allowing goods and people to move freely.It has its own parliament, central bank and the euro currency used by  countries, with some members including Britain opting to keep their own money.Eurocrats have been pushing for ever closer political and financial union, which could include a European Army separate from the Nato alliance.Those in favour of leaving said Britain was being held back by EU red tape with too many rules on business.They also campaigned on the issue of sovereignty and said they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders.Beyond the question of ceasing to be a member of the EU, what Brexit actually means in practice has been the subject of intense debate ever since.Theresa May officially triggered Article  on March ,  after which there was a two-year time limit set for negotiations to hammer out the details.The UK is therefore bound to leave the EU by March , , although there is a -month transition period.Negotiations began on June , with the two chief negotiators, Michel Barnier of the EU and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, immediately setting off to find common ground.Some of the “uncertainties” being discussed include citizens living in each others territory, border arrangements between Ireland and the UK and the amount Britain stands to pay to honour its existing EU commitments.This is a bridging agreement between the current situation – where we are members of the EU – and our long-term relationship outside the bloc.Also known as an implementation phase, it allows for the UK to keep some of the same arrangements with Brussels on trade and other matters until a new comprehensive trade agreement is sealed.In March , Britain secured a transition deal that will also allow ministers to seek trade agreements around the globe.The UK will also be free to set its own foreign policy as soon as Brexit happens, as well as negotiate and sign new trade deals anywhere in the world – to implement them in .However EU chiefs made it clear the period, which allows the UK to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, will only come into forcethe Irish border is sorted.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled terms for the  month interim period.The UK will not be fully out of the EU until December ,  – four and a half years after the historic referendum decision.But EU leaders have suggested they could extend the transition period further.Theresa May finally struck a Brexit deal with Brussels on November ,, after days of round-the-clock talks in Brussels.But this has proved just the beginning of a long drawn-out, painful process.The opposition centred predominantly on the backstop agreement which ensures there is never a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.In a dramatic night at Westminster on January , the Prime Minister succeeded in uniting her party behind a plan to rewrite the deal to address concerns about the Irish backstop.But senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin warned that the demand only made a no-deal Brexit more likely as the clock ticks down to the UKs scheduled departure from the European Union on March .European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the Agreement reached after  months of negotiation last November as the best and only deal possible.And he told MEPs in the European Parliament in Brussels: The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that.The Withdrawal Agreement will not be renegotiated.May is set to go back to the EU and demand it ditches the hated Northern Ireland backstop in a last ditch plan to save Brexit.It came after the UK parliament backed an amendment instructing the Prime Minister to demand that Brussels replace the backstop — which aims to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit  — with alternative arrangements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border vote latest","story":"The Prime Minister spoke at the Northern Irish border on Tuesday February  to deliver a speech regarding the border.

It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography.The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been.And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.She proposed annual meetings between the British and Irish governments after Brexit to ensure the two countries work closely together.And she added: Both the UK and the Irish Governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this.Mrs May admitted she must face up to the fact that MPs resoundingly rejected the Irish backstop plan - which could leave the UK trapped in the European customs union.But she hinted she may not ditch the backstop altogether, saying that any Brexit deal will need an insurance policy for the future.Earlier today DUP leader Arlene Foster vowed to back the PMs dealshe succeeds in rewriting the plan for the Irish border.The DUP are crucial to Mrs Mays strategy - because she believesthey come on board and back her deal, dozens of Tory Brexiteers will follow.Today Mrs Foster told the BBC: If the backstop is dealt with in the withdrawal agreement, then despite the fact that we may have misgivings around other parts of the agreement, we will support the Prime Minister.Because we do want Brexit to happen in an orderly fashion.The unionist boss said the current backstop would have to be replaced by a dferent way of keeping the Irish border open.She promised to lobby Mrs May on the issue when they hold talks in Belfast tomorrow.She said: We will be reiterating our opposition to the current backstop. And the fact that Parliament has now backed that position means that she has a clear mandate to go back to Brussels.The current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.Mrs May got a boost from Angela Merkel yesterday as the German leader called on Brussels to be flexible with Britain.And a grand committee of Tory MPs from across the Brexit ide is meeting civil servants for a second day of talks on how to find alternative arrangements which could replace the backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn second brexit referendum frankenstein","story":"In a huge blow for Remainers who hope that the Labour boss will eventually throw his weight behind another Brexit vote, the uncovered video shows him slamming the bloc.And he mocked the idea of a second referendum too, saying he had a feeling theyre going to keep on voting to get the answer they want after Ireland narrowly rejected adopting the Lisbon Treaty, a video unearthed by the Red Roar revealed.In a rally in  he branded the EU as subservient to Nato and said he did not want to live in a European empire of the st century.At the event organised by the Irish Anti-War movement he said he wished Britain would have a referendum too on whether to accept the new demands from the bloc.Backbencher Mr Corbyn blasted: Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, Europe will become subservient to the wishes of Nato and the aims of Nato.We are creating for ourselves here one massive Frankenstein, which will damage all of us in the long run.Mr Corbyns Remain supporters think he will cave and back a fresh vote to stay in the European Union.But this video shows the Labour boss true colours - and shows that hopes he will come out in favour of a second Brexit referendum to overturn the result are incredibly slim.Even Brexiteer Nigel Farage praised the speech, saying he was a real Eurosceptic.He went on: His role will be crucial over the next few weeks.Will the real Jeremy Corbyn please stand up And SNP MP Stewart McDonald tweeted earlier: He and Farage were singing from the same song sheet, albeit from dferent ends of the political spectrum.Mr Corbyn has a long history of Euroscepticism and famously was slammed for taking a back seat in the  EU referendum.Since then hes had to walk a tightrope over Brexit to try and keep all sides of his party happy.BRITAIN should continue allow free movement in some forms after we leave, Sir Keir Starmer has said.In a signicant softening of Labours position the Shadow Brexit Secretary called for Britain to allign with the EU after we leave.He said people would be willing to accept free movement of people with some restrictions - like advertising a job locally first, or bringing family members over.Sir Keir told the BBC: If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say I accept that.Most people say thatyou are coming to join your family that is something I can accept. Most people would saysomebody wants to come here and study and it is genuine then of course please come and study.

Whether they voted Leave or Remain, the one thing you hear is get this thing done and dusted.Leaving without a deal wouldnt be the end of the world, but it wouldnt be a walk in the park, he said, which is also the view of Roberto Azevedo, the Director of the World Trade Organisation.Mr Raab even hinted that Britain could be SAFER after Brexit - because well be able to refuse entry to anyone that border officials are worried about.Britain is due to leave the EU on March  no matter what happens, but the PM has promised to go back and ask for changes to the hated Northern Irish backstop.Mrs May is still clinging to her deal, but accepts that MPs dont want it in its current form.She will come up with the plan to take to Brussels later this week which involves major changes to the Northern Ireland border."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000462215077.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"danny dyer right royal family flaw","story":"A documentary that was as funny as it was surprising, and all the more so because the BBC did the right thing and played it absolutely straight.Genuine blue plaque television, in fact, that should never have been revisited or reformatted, not least because it would remind the Beeb that Danny’s wonderful everyman story had killed the whole WDYTYA franchise.So I’d been expecting this sucker punch, ever since its final credits rolled in .Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family, on BBC. “A potty old adventure,” as his nibs described it, tracing Danny’s family line even further back, to Scandinavia’s King Rollo, his -times great grandfather, who I’d always assumed was a s children’s cartoon character, rather than a ninth-century Viking warrior.There were two episodes of it this time as well, which I know some of you thought were as funny as the original. Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

The Prime Minister used a visit to Belfast to pledge her commitment to the “insurance policy” aimed at avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event of a no-deal. She jets to Brussels on Thursday for crisis talks with EU chiefs as she tries to overhaul the agreement so she can force it through Parliament. The backstop is an insurance policy aimed at avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in the event of a no-deal departure. It would extend EU customs rules over the UK from  January  but give us no say over them. So far Mrs May has said she is pursuing either alternative arrangements, an exit clause in the backstop, or a time limit in the backstop. EU chiefs have repeatedly said they wont ditch the backstop and wont include a time limit. Today she said: “The issue that has always been one that Parliament has raised - its been raised across all sides of the House of Commons - is the potential indefinite nature of the backstop.   “Thats the issue we look to address.” Taking questions after her -minute speech, Mrs May was also accused of having “betrayed and shafted” Northern Irish businesses over the backstop. Industry chiefs feared she was set to U-turn on pledges the measure would be in place to stop checks and infrastructure along the -mile frontier which will form the only land border between the UK and the EU. The rattled PM hit back: “There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision – its been called an insurance policy, the backstop – that ensures thatthe future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border. “Our commitment to that remains.” She added: “Im not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesnt contain that insurance policy for the future.” But her suggestion that the backstop would not be junked then sparked anger among hard Brexiteer Tories. A source in Jacob Rees-Moggs European Research Group of MPs warned: Evenshe doesnt mean what she said, we still do.   That leaves Mrs May facing another Commons defeat in the next vote on February MPs decide shes not gone far enough. Downing Street sources later claried that all three options were still under consideration. Mrs May will skip her weekly head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons tomorrow as she holds talks with the DUP and Sinn Fein at Stormont. She is due to fly to Brussels for crunch showdown with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since her plan suffered a crushing -vote defeat in Parliament last month. Last week, MPs agreed to back the pactshe can win changes to the backstop, The PM’s chief-of-staff Gavin Barwell travelled to Brussels yesterday earlier this week to meet European politicians and officials, paving the way for Mrs Mays visit.   She warned the Cabinet today that “the discussions with the EU will not be easy but Parliament has sent a clear message that changes to the backstop is the only way to get a deal approved”, her spokesman revealed. He added: “The PM said her objective now is to secure a legally binding way of ensuring we can’t be indefinitely trapped in the backstop.”\u2028 Work is ongoing “urgently” on three options for changing the backstop so Mrs May has something to take back to Brussels.\u2028 They include looking at “alternative arrangements” from a group of Remainer and Brexiteer Tory MPs, as well as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s work on a unilateral exit mechanism or time limit to the backstop.\u2028 Labour leader Mr Corbyn also revealed his own concerns about the backstop, senior ministers were told.\u2028 “This is an issue that needs to be resolved not just for our colleagues and the DUP but for MPs across the House,” her spokesman said. The DUP wants the PM to ditch the backstop altogether. But the EU has insisted there can be no withdrawal pact without one. Setting a time limit would mean that it was not an insurance policy, officials claim. British negotiators hope to secure a guarantee it will only last for a set period of time to ease fears the UK will become trapped forever in the arrangement.

Unless Tory ministers change tack, more elderly people will go without proper care, disabled people will be worse off, more vulnerable children will fall through the net, and our communities will become more unpleasant, unsafe and unattractive places to live. For nine years, councils have risen to the challenge of making what the Government calls “efficiency savings. But they’ve reached the end of the line, with so-called “non-essential services” being cut to the bone.  Since , over  libraries, as many as  Sure Start centres and over  youth centres have closed. This is a crisis of the Tories’ making, but they are pushing the blame onto councils, communities, carers and families. Councils are warning they are reaching a “tipping point”, but the Tories are cutting even more. The cross-party Local Government Associationhas stated that councils arefacing a funding gap of pound. billion just to keep services at the level they are in  . The crisis in social care is already having severe consequences on how we care for elderly people. It’s set to get even worse. Social care has a pound. billion funding gap next year, and . million elderly people are living without the care they need - up nearly  per cent in just two years. The Government should be investing in our most in-need areas – but they are cutting them even harder.The Tories are planning changes to the way it gives funding to councils. Instead of targeting the most deprived areas, or those with the most need, they’ll instead introduce new plans that mostly help out more affluent Tory areas.  This settlement is inadequate and unfair. Labour will vote against it to send a clear message to this Tory Government that they need to come back with proposals that give councils the funding they need. The Tories must think again before the start of the next financial year. It’s not too late.

We were shown the figures after weeks of speculation around membership numbers. Labour has refused calls to publish an updated total, despite attacking a flurry of inaccurate reports.   After being shown the figures, we put the total membership figure of around , to four further sources, who all said it was broadly accurate.

The figures we have been shown do match reports in Scotlands Herald on Sunday, which said Scottish membership had dropped to just over ,.   Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney blamed that drop on a natural cycle because last year we had a leadership election. He told the BBC: As many people who are familiar with party political dynamics will know, many people join parties in order to participate in leadership elections. After we approached them with the figures today, Labour HQ sources insisted there are always members in arrears, and the number of new joiners has been particularly high in recent weeks. There are always spikes in people joining during general elections, which then lapse in between elections, a Labour source said.Membership has more than doubled since  and the Tories wont even ulge their membership figures - estimated at around ,. Last year it was revealed that the Conservatives receive more funds from the dead than from living members.We put our figures, including the regional breakdown, formally to the Labour Party to respond before publication.

The Home Secretary also took issue with the questions posed of him, saying the Labour MP does himself a huge disservice in the way that he speaks and the tone that hes used to suggest there is even an ounce of racism in this House.He added that some of those Windrush generation members who died after being deported were sent back as a result of decisions made while Mr Lammy himself was in Government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.MrJavidsaid the Labour MP had supported immigration restrictions and only now he chooses to speak up about some of the inadvertent effects of that.

All iniduals on this charter flight are serious criminals. Mr Lammy made his comments during an urgent debate on the Home Offices handling of the Windrush scandal. The Windrush generation are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Years Day .

A poll of , adults found that more than eight out of tenagree that “as local authorities provide public money for the bus network, they should have more control over bus services.” The poll for Better Buses for Greater Manchester found three out of foursupported re-regulation of buses in the region. At present local authorities have no control over the fares, ticketing and the routes of around % of bus services in Greater Manchester, despite the fact that some % of bus companies revenue is public money. Some % of voters said they supported a London-style pay as you go smart card ticket which caps daily spend automatically, and is only possible with regulation. Greater Manchester is one of the first British cities to be considering re-regulating its bus network, which would give the mayor the choice to put the public in control instead of the big firms. Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, has to choose between parternships with bus firms or regulation, which gives local authorities control over fares, routes and timetables. Regulation will provide the ability to ‘cross-subsidise’ - using funds from busy bus routes to pay for socially necessary ones. A decision is expected later this year.  Pascale Robinson of Better Buses for Greater Manchester noted: ‘When Andy Burnham makes the decision on bus reform, we need him to listen to what people in Greater Manchester are saying clearly: we want and deserve a much better, regulated bus network. “The deregulated system has left us with an expensive, stripped-back, fragmented bus network. A regulated network will mean a bus network run for communities, not shareholders.” OneBus, a partnership of all commercial bus operators in Greater Manchester, has pledged a poundm blueprint to improve services including:investing in  new buses to improve air quality a single unied brand across all operator buses an action plan to tackle congestion hotspots and a two-year price freeze on multi-operator bus fares. Gary Nolan, chief executive of OneBus,said the mayor was evaluating an alternative franchising option, which would see taxpayers become responsible for the full cost of the bus network instead of the current system where the majority of costs are covered by bus operators. He added:”The only place in the UK where a franchising system operates is in London where bus use has fallen % in the past three years, Transport for London is facing a poundm deficit and many bus services are having to be cut.” The findings come two months after the Mirror revealed that the big five bus companies aid a staggering pound.bn in idends to shareholders over the last ten years while fares have soared and services have been axed. Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth has called for free bus travel to get people out of their cars and onto public transport to help the government reduce climate-changing greenhouse gases. Mike Childs, of Friends of the Earth, said: “Free bus travel for the under ’s at first, before widening the scheme, would make for more livable cities and cut damaging greenhouse gas emissions. “Dozens of cities across the world offer some form of free public transport. It would cost around pound billion a year, but this is a fraction of the money spent on roads. “Three times more journeys are by bus than train and they are the main means of transport for the car-less quarter of the population.

The mum-of-two says she was reading in bed when she heard the panicked cry of a woman in the street outside. The startled woman, who has reported it to police, said it was .am on Friday -  minutes after the last confirmed sighting of Libby. Libby was last seen sitting on a bench in Hull, East Yorkshire on Thursday at .pm, less than  yards away. Today her distraught parents, held hands as they released an emotional video begging her to get in touch. Mum Lisa Squire, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, said: “It is breaking my heart not knowing where you are.”   The video was released as Humberside Police took to rubber dinghies for a painstaking search of nearby Barmston Drain waterway. They used an underwater camera in one of two frozen waterways, both a few minutes walk from Libby’s home. Witnesses have told how Libby was turned away from the Wellly nightclub on Thursday night for being too drunk. A pal put her in a taxi and she was dropped off outside her home a mile away. But her neighbours said she never made it through her front door and went off staggering down the street. She ended up sat on a nearby bench where she was caught on CCTV. The scream was allegedly heard just around the corner from netball player Libby’s terraced shared student house on Wellesley Avenue.   The concerned mum of two, who lives in nearby Heathcote Street near where it joins Wellesley Avenue, said: “We did hear screaming at . on Thursday night. “I was just in bed reading. We do get a lot of students who live in the road that Libby lives in who use this road as a cut through. “They go past screaming, shouting and singing. It’s not unusual. “But this made us sit up. It sounded like someone being attacked. The scream sounded like it was coming from someone who was scared. “It was someone walking quite close past our house. It was just one female scream. “It was really shrill and urgent. It made me sit up and think ‘Oh my God’.  “Then we heard other voices muttering very low, murmuring and then more screams and more male voices. “Then we heard the slamming of a door. It sounded like a wooden door or a garden gate. “It was just very odd,” added the woman, a Hull University graduate whose dad is a retired policeman. “We didn’t think about it again until the police came round knocking on everybody’s doors on Saturday,” she recalled. “We talked about it and remembered the scream and rang .”   Humberside Police have still not come around to take a statement after she reported the incident on Saturday evening. The force has been contacted for comment. Meanwhile, the hunt for the missing girl has been stepped up with officers rummaging through bins and lting drain covers in search of clues. The Hull University philosophy and religious studies student moved into her shared house with two other flat mates four months ago. Her disappearance has stunned and frightened fellow residents and students. Student Tom Wilkinson, , a pal of Libby’s flatmate Chloe Wise, said: “Everyone is scared. Everyone is still worried for her. No one feels safe when they go on a night out. “As students we got out a lot but it’s scary thinking you can’t even get a taxi back and be safe.”  Louisa Amasanti, , said: “It’s scary and surreal. No one is going anywhere alone. “Everyone has all kinds of theories but people seem to think she wandered off somewhere and fell somehow.” Her father Russell, , said in their video appeal: “Libby is our kind, thoughtful, beautul girl who is loved by so many people. As you can appreciate, this is a very dficult time for us both. “We would like to thank everyone for their help and support so far. “Your messages and kind words are a great source of strength for us both. “Please come forward with any information you may have no matter how small or irrelevant it may be, we just want Libby home.” Libby’s mother, Lisa, , added: “Libby, my darling pie. We just want to know that you are safe. “Please get in touch with us any way you can. The whole family is missing you especially me and your dad, sisters and brother. “I miss you so much.

There are  spots for the new devices in North West England, including Sefton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Wirral and St Helens. However, although the places are accurate, only a handful of the cameras are active, the Liverpool Echo reports. This means that motorists can only get caught in two of the listed locations so far. Speed on green cameras not only detect when a driver has jumped a red traffic light signal, but also record the speed of those vehicles travelling above the speed limit through a junction, regardless of the colour of the traffic light signal. A number of suitable junctions have been earmarked for the ‘speed on green’ cameras with Sefton, Merseyside, being the first area to receive them.   During the trial period, the two locations in Sefton will have active speed on green cameras - meaning drivers could get caught out at the Crosby and Maghull locations. The rest of the locations on the list wont be activated until later should the trial go to plan. This new type of camera records a drivers speed at traffic lights is currently being trialled on the streets of Merseyside. The temporary scheme is part of Merseyside Polices strategy to reduce the number and severity of injury collisions and to reduce the overall speed of vehicles on the regions roads.

His ordeal started after letters asking him to attend job centre appointments were sent to his late fathers address, rather than the hostel he was living in.As a result, he missed the appointments and had his benefits sanctioned, HullLive reports .He later attended a job centre meeting on Friday, February , in order to get Universal Credit money paid to him, but says he was left on hold for over an hour with a Department of Work and Pensions advisor before she hung up on him, explaining that her sht finished at .pm.   Mr Precious says he suffers from mental health issues and has been left suicidal over the mix-up. After being sanctioned through no fault of my own, Ive not been paid since December , which has left me unable to pay my rent at my hostel, and has left me starving as Ive got no money for food either, said Mr Precious. To try and fix the problem, I told the Job Centre Id only missed the meetings with them because they had sent the appointment letters to a house I dont live at, so didnt receive them, and I was told to come in to speak with one of their advisors to get my payment sorted for the next day. I went in to the Job Centre but all the woman I was assigned to did was ring the Universal Credit number and sat there on hold for over an hour trying to get through while listening to Vivaldis Four Seasons, which I could have just done myself. Then when it got to .pm, she hung up as she said she had finished her sht, and gave me another number to ring on Monday [February ], and then kicked me out to just fend for myself with no money and food, and nowhere to sleep but on the streets.  Its made me suicidal - Ive got mental issues, anxiety, depression and COPD and the streets are just no place for me to be, but Ive got absolutely no money to pay for my hostel, and nothing to eat so Im going to starve unless I can get to a food bank. Ive had to live on the streets before and its so tough and not something I wanted to have to do again - its freezing and you have to keep moving all the time and dared not fall asleep in case of getting attacked. Im just so fed up, I really am. I dont know where to turn and I cant believe that it has come to this through absolutely no fault of my own. I dont know what more to do and I just hope that my payments can get sorted soon as its really unfair. The DWP have indicated that Shaun notied them of his change of address in December and say there is a system of payments available for people who need immediate support. A spokesman said:“Universal Credit is a force for good, and is working for the vast majority of people. “Sanctions are only used in a very small percentage of cases when people fail to meet their agreed commitments infor benefits, such as a failure to attend multiple meetings with their Work Coach without good reason. “We will always contact people to resolve any issues around attendance, using the latest details they have provided us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man year 2030 reveals gadget","story":"NewsMan from year  reveals gadget he used to travel through timeKnown only as Noah, the mysterious man previously claimed on Youtube channel Apex TV that he knows what happens the UK after BrexitShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-from--unveils-incredible-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man claiming to be from the year  has revealed how he travels through time.Known only as Noah, the mysterious man recently gained notoriety by claiming he knows what will happen the UK after Brexit .He has also said who will become the next president of the United States.

The terrying incident reportedly happened in the US city of Westland, Michigan, at the Eloise Asylum - made famous by psychological thriller Eloise. Todd Bonner, co-founder of Detroit Paranormal Expeditions, claimed it wasnt the first time his team had fled the creepy building in terror. He said: We believe the building to be haunted. Almost on a daily basis strange occurrences happen there, including disembodied voices, shadow figures, foot steps, doors closing and moving objects.   We have had team members leave the building because of fear and Im included in that. In the video, the team are exploring a dark hallway in the facility when, out of nowhere, a loud crash is heard behind them. They then announce to whoever is listening that theyre leaving, before seeing a vinyl record has been lted from a shelf and smashed against the floor. Mr Bonner added that one of the group had reported seeing a shadowy figure only moments before the incident. He said: Brandy Miller, our team psychic, was doing some electronic voice phenomena work with a piece of equipment called a geobox. She was with several other investigators.   One of them had seen a shadowy figure out of the corner of her eye, so they decided to walk over to the area she had seen it. In the video you can kind of hear them talking about a black figure and how they thought it was in that area. Then an old vinyl record flew off a shelf, hovered in the air and slammed to the ground. Started as a poorhouse, Eloise at its peak was like a small city - with , patients, numerous staff and everything they needed on site. It had its own police force, fire department, bakery, post office, power plant and trolley system, said Todd. It was a self-contained city. It comprised  buildings across  acres, much of which has since been sold to developers, flattened and turned into shops, apartments and more. But with such a spooky reputation to shake, the final few buildings have struggled to attract a buyer, hitting the market for .m - about pound.m in , before selling for just  - p - last year.

The customer had allegedly claimed she was a police officer and that her human rights were violated when staff refused to give her a free round of drinks when she dropped the previous round on the floor. She later took to TripAdvisor to claim that the pubs staff had taken a disliking to her group and had an issue with happy people, Bristol Live reports.In his scathing riposte, landlord James Aylfe asked the woman, Hows the head this morning , and claimed she had been kicked out of the Hobgoblin pub in Bristol. His reply is serving as another example of bar and restaurant owners hitting back at bad reviews.   The woman, registered on TripAdvisor as ‘Chloe A’ posted on the public review website on Saturday night after allegedly being kicked out of the venue.Her review was headed ‘unreasonable’, and complained the bar staff took her for being drunk, even though she said she wasn’t. She explained how she and four friends had entered the pub but her stay did not last long. “The staff took a disliking to us the second we walked in,” she wrote. “We are a group of five who haven’t seen each other since uni. “They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishment. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people,” she added. At least that is the best interpretation of what Chloe A wrote on TripAdvisor, Bristol Live reported.She actually tapped in: “The staff good a disliking to use the second we walked in. We are a group of  who haven’t seen us since uni. They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishmst. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people.” Hobgoblin owner James saw the review the next day, and claims he immediately recognised who Chloe A was from the night before. He decided to respond to set the record straight, and also back up his staff, who were allegedly left upset by the experience of dealing with Chloe.   James response on TripAdvisor began inquiring after her health, before saying she might not be able to remember exactly what happened. He explained things began well - she was served a round of drinks with no problem. But then Chloe A’s time in the Hobgoblin took something of a downward turn almost immediately, because as she carried them back to the table, she spilt all the drinks after ‘stumbling away from the bar, barging into another customer’ And it was at this point, according to James, it started getting a little weird, and rather unpleasant for the staff behind the bar. She ed to the bar and ‘aggressively demanded’ replacement drinks for free, James wrote. “At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff,” he wrote, followed up by a scathing remark. “You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . “You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights,” he added. But James went on to explain the effect this behaviour had on staff and other customers. One member of staff was reduced to tears, other customers complained about her behaviour, he said. And when the assistant manager asked Chloe A to leave, she was not going to go quietly. According to James, she ‘continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights’. “So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person,” he added, before ending by stating he was ‘completely comfortable’ with how she was treated by his staff, and suggesting that she should perhaps come to the bar with an apology. Since he posted the response on the pubs Facebook page, it has gone viral. Bristol Live has messaged Chloe A, but is yet to receive a response. James said he took the decision to share his response as a show of support for the staff involved. We dont get many one-star reviews, in fact I think hers was the just the third, so mercully we havent particularly suffered from reviews like this, he told Bristol Live . I didnt want to make a big deal about it, but I didnt feel I could just leave it unanswered. What has been really nice is that the response from customers has been almost universally positive - its been really nice to see, and nice for the staff, becauseyou get a slightly unpleasant experience it can knock your confidence in dealing with people. What was also good was that a number of people commented that they were there and that the staff did really well and acted properly, he added. James Aylfes response in full Hi Chloe, Hows the head this morning  Id be surprisedyou can actually remember your behaviour last night so, just in case its a little foggy, lets have a recap, shall we  Although you were initially served a round of drinks, after you stumbled away from the bar and barged into another customer, dropping your drinks on the floor, we began to realise that you werent *entirely* sober. This assessment was further strengthened when you ed to the bar, aggressively demanding that your spilt drinks be replaced for free. You were refused. At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff. You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights. In the cold light of this morning these were rather obviously the angry ravings of someone well in their cups but as funny as it sounds now, you were extremely aggressive and intimidating at the time. A number of other customers commented that your behaviour was inappropriate, and you reduced the member of bar staff to tears. Once we had discussed what had happened, we decided that frankly it would be bestyou all moved on and we informed you that we wouldnt be serving you any further. Instead of leaving quietly with your friends you continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights. So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person. Im really not sure that paints you in a particularly flattering light either way and I am completely comfortable with how you were dealt with last night. As for where we go from here, Ill leave that up to you. Id suggest contrition and heartfelt apology as a bare minimum requirement to you being served here againbut you are, of course, free to seek to enforce your *ahem* human rights in the courtsyou are so determined.

Police were called in after several vehicles were reportedly unlocked at the Asda car park inWolstantonRetail Park, Newcastle-under-Lyme on Sunday.Although it was reportedly feared thieves were targeting the busy North Staffordshire area, there were no reports of any items being stolen.It is believed that a crime gang could have used a key fob jamming device to send a signal to stop motorists from locking or unlocking their doors remotely, Stoke on Trent Live reports.One driver ed from his shopping to find he could neither unlock or lock his car.   In a post on social media, he said: Just to make anyone aware who happens to be going to Asda in Wolstanton, make sure your car is locked before walking away. Ive just been there and someone is either messing about with an electronic jamming device or using one to try and steal or ransack cars. Myself and a number of other people have either come back to their cars unlocked or parked up and then not been able to lock or unlock their cars. It only seems to last a couple of minutes, but it happened at least three times while I was there. Im not suretheres anything they can do, but its been reported to the police.  Shopper Simon Hallsworth worries motorists cant do anything to protect their vehicles. The -year-old, who owns a software company, said: When you press the key fob it sends a code to the car and someone can capture that on their device and use it to unlock your car. Its worrying because at the moment theres no solution for it, so its going to get worse before it gets better. Its serious and unfortunately this technology is being used by people for the wrong purpose. At the moment theres nothing you can do until the car manufacturers find a way of making it more secure. You can open a car quite simply with the device.  Lin Lansley, from Biddulph, thinks its technology gone too far. The -year-old said: Ive heard about this happening and it is worrying. It happened to my friend where her car key was in the house and someone was able to scan it from outside and use it to unlock her car. You have to be very careful and the car manufacturers should have thought of this before making this technology. Cars are expensive and not something you take buying lightly. This technology is making it easier for people to steal cars or their contents - its not safe. Lynn Heath, , from Brown Edge, added: Its worrying, Ive heard about this happening before but you dont think its going to be local. Theres nothing you can do to stop it either. Ill try to keep an eye on my keys, but I wont be able to tellsomebody is scanning it. They need to come up with something to prevent this from happening. I prefer the old fashioned way of using the key to lock and unlock your car.  Staffordshire Police have launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesman said: Officers were called to a report of a number of cars unlocked at Asda on Wolstanton Retail Park in Newcastle just before .pm on Sunday. Anyone with information is asked to come forward. Asda confirmed it is assisting police with their inquiries.

It means Sophies skin and clothes can be completely drenched in just a few hours. Sophie, of Houston, Texas, USA, admits it also made nights out and dating a nightmare.  She said: If Im out with friends, I make frequent trips to the bathroom to dry my armpits using a hand-dryer I sweat so much that Im pretty much always uncomfortable, but winter is by far the worst time. Its really horrible at the moment, because Im sweating just as much but the sweat runs cold. I have to dress up warmly, but I know that the sweat will start to soak through the layers, which then starts to freeze making me even colder. Theres no way I can win and it can make me really depressed sometimes.   Communication studies student Sophie, who is at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, Sophie, who has to drink an average of . litres of water each day to replace her moisture loss and stay hydrated.The NHS recommend . litres.But Sophie is determined to see the positive side and has turned her perspiring into a party trick, making her hands sweat on cue. She said: I call myself the Sweat Bender, after Uri Geller the Spoon Bender because I have this ability to make my hands sweat really fast just by thinking about sweating. Its like a kind of superpower, although possibly the worst superpower in the world. My friends enjoy watching it though.   But Sophie has not always found it easy to make light of her condition, which mainly affects her hands, armpits and feet. She said: I have broken my computer and my phone because of water damage, and I also really struggle to drive because the wheel slips around in my hands. I had also considered a career in medicine, but I know thats something that probably isnt an option for me - because who wants to be examined by someone with clammy hands, let alone hands dripping with sweat  Sophies parents, William, , who works for the space agency NASA, and stay-at-home mum Heidi, , realised she was stickier than her playmates. When she was two Sophies cousin, Emily, then aged four, refused to hold her hand, saying it was too gross. But, as William was also prone to sweating, they were not overly concerned, assuming she was like her dad until she reached school age, when they realised her problem was causing her embarrassment and discomfort.Single Sophie who was diagnosed when she was eight, said: I was constantly having to dry my hands on my clothes at school , to the extent where theyd always be wet. Id leave puddles on my work and kids wouldnt want to get anywhere near me. Things came to a head when Sophie was humiliated in front of her classmates by a teacher who askedshe had had an accident, on her hands as she was so wet. She said: Obviously, at that age, all the kids laughed and it was very upsetting for me, as an eight year old, to be made fun of in front of so many people. Her parents took her to see a doctor and she was diagnosed with primary hyperhidrosis, an inherited disorder that begins in childhood and normally affects only certain areas - in Sophies case, her hands, feet and armpits. She has tried ious treatments, including iontophoresis where the hands are placed in water that is connected to an electrical current, but none have been effective. Unable to find a cure for her condition, Sophie - who cannot afford Botox treatment, which can be very effective, but costs ,for each six-monthly session - found ways of adapting. She said: I began carrying sweat rags around with me all the time and would only wear very particular kind of clothes.  Youll never see me wearing a grey T-shirt and I only ever really wear white and black, which make sweat marks less obvious. Im careful to feel all of my clothes before I buy them, too. I need something that I can dry my hands on throughout the day that wont show up the moisture marks. An introverted youngster, because of her condition, she felt isolated from her peers until she joined secondary school and met a group of friends who were far more understanding and accepting of her unusual complaint.Sophie, who also has eczema on her feet because of her condition, said: When you have a disorder like mine that you cant control or stop, you can either let it make you miserable or start to own it.So I started to own it, openly telling people about hyperhidrosis and how it affects me. I think people respected that. Sometimes though, her openness about her hyperhidrosis has caused her problems.  Sophie said: I once told someone I was on a date with about it - as I always do whenever I meet someone - and he took it fine, but then kept on referencing it and making jokes about it throughout the date. I was thinking: Can we just move on  I dont like the fact that people often define me by it.Nevertheless, her hyperhidrosis is not something Sophie wants to hide from and she has created an account on the picture-sharing site Instagram to discuss openly her condition.She said: I feel like I have to embrace this, not to shy away from it and pretend like everything is fine. Im going to spend my le living with this - so I have to face up to it.

The student, of the University of North Carolina in the US, was freaked out after items in her room started disappearing and hand prints were left behind on the bathroom wall and mirror. But the young woman, known only as Maddie, discovered there was no ghost - instead, a cross-dressing man had been in her room, taking her clothes. Police, who were called to the scene in Greensboro, said the student had found a man in her clothes going through her closet. Maddie spoke with the local Fox station, but didn’t want to be fully identied.   The college junior said: “I’ve been having like pieces of clothes missing. Like shirts and pants. Items were disappearing and hand prints were left behind on the bathroom wall and mirror. But it was not until Saturday that she uncovered a mystery that she and her roommates thought was a ghost. She claimed to the channel: “I just hear rattling in my closet. It sounded like a raccoon in my closet. “I’m like who’s there  And somebody answers me. He’s like ‘oh my name is Drew.’   “I open the door and he’s in there, wearing all of my clothes. My socks. My shoes. And he has a book bag full of my clothes.” The police arrived and later confirmed the alleged cross-dressing ‘ghost’ was Andrew Swofford. The -year-old appeared in court on Monday via video conference from the Guilford County Jail. Maddie called her boyfriend, but she said she had to calmly talk to the suspect to keep him distracted until help arrived.   “He tries on my hat, she alleged. He goes in the bathroom and looks in the mirror and then is like ‘you’re really pretty, can I give you a hug ’ she recalls. “But he never touched me.” An investigation is now underway to establish how the suspect apparently got into the flat. Incredibly, it is not the first time strangers were in there. Maddie said recently she found two strange men in her lounge. She told Fox: “There were two guys in the living room.” The locks were changed after that, but somehow Swofford is alleged to have gained access. Maddie and her roommate say they’ve now had enough.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS. But this was the wrong letter . . . to the wrong people . . . on the wrong day.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

The bar and restaurant shut its doors on Sunday, with bosses planning to reopen at Easter as Vic’s  The Vine. Buzzworks, who have operated Elliots as their flagship in the town, say the rebrand will be split into two halves. Managing director Kenny Blair said: “It’s essential to evolve within the hospitality industry and look at innovative ways to create new and exciting concepts for our customers. “Our work to reincarnate Elliots is part of our wider growth strategy, both benefiting the local community and Scotland’s hospitality industry.” Vic’s  The Vine will feature a -cover restaurant called The Vine serving food from breakfast until late. The bar will be called Vic’s and will be a “modern take on a traditional bar”, featuring sport and entertainment. Weekend opening hours will remain at .am.  Designer Jim Hamilton is leading the project, which will include a new glass roof in part of the bar. A new kitchen boasting a churrasco BBQ pit is also planned. Bosses say Vic’s will be the first venue in Ayrshire to serve fresh, unpasteurised tank beer straight from the brewery. Kenny added: “We’ve seen an appetite in the industry for more cool and modern pubs and, similarly to our T-Bar in Ayr, Vic’s will be a traditional bar with a twist. “This will both suit the local market and sit alongside our excellent new restaurant offering in Prestwick. “Our vision is to create the best day-to-night venue in Scotland and we are confident Vic’s  The Vine will match those expectations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPrestwickAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"former royal hotel ayr sold","story":"NewsFormer Royal Hotel in Ayr is sold at auctionBuilding is branded the most dangerous in the townShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB NewsRoyal Hotel Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe former Royal Hotel, which has been described as the most dangerous building in Ayr, has been sold at auction. The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"weather knocks out weekend shutdown","story":"NewsWeather knocks out weekend shutdown of the main ASub zero temperatures have played havoc with road teamsShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoad chiefs have axed major roadworks which would have seen the main A completely closed from pm tonight.

such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

As it turned out, A Dark Carnival was the latest opus from Vanishing Point, the internationally renowned company that provides a vehicle for the dark visions of its artistic director Matthew Lenton. With Smith and A New International at its musical core, the seriousness of the project came as something of a surprise to the band.ldquoItrsquos probably fair to say the band are all sceptics, says Smith. ldquoIt took them six months to believe this was actually happening. I remember we decided to for for a walk in the Necropolis, and afterwards going for a drink, and the penny finally dropping when one of them said, lsquoYou didnrsquot tell me it was a real theatre companyrsquo. The music industry and the arts world in general does tend to attract blowhards and people who promise you the things that never materialise, so I dare say that informed their attitude.This is a fair enough assumption to make. Lenton, after all, had originally had a notion for Tom Waits to provide the score for what looks set to be an absurd and tragi-comic pop opera which goes beyond the grave to unearth a community of the dead, while angels watch from above.Things changed, however, when Lenton heard a New Internationalrsquos song, Valentino, on the radio while driving. Lenton tracked Smith down, they met, and Smith ldquostarted to become part of the world of the play.As the video to a song from the show, Necropolitan, A New Internationalrsquos flamboyant mix of nouveau cabaret with retro sensibilities was a theatrical marriage with Vanishing Point in waiting.ldquoIt was kind of a no-brainer, says Smith. ldquoI always liked theatre. I appeared in Dracula at Cumbernauld Youth Theatre when I was a raw -year old, and when I met Matt I Immediately started having ideas. I love things with a dark sense of humour, macabre, Tim Burton, Rocky Horror. Fagin always appealed. I love those songs I grew up with them. This is the first time Irsquove written for a brief, and I found that quite liberating. Itrsquos almost like yoursquore halfway through the creative process, like I had a head start. So I started writing, and couldnrsquot stop for a while.The first fruits of this unholy collaboration came a year ago with A Night at the Theatre, three bijou concert performances of the sixteen songs penned by Smith for The Dark Carnival, punctuated by short monologues written by Lenton and performed by actors Pauline Goldsmith and Peter Kelly. Since then, the show has been expanded to feature eight actors working alongside a parallel eight-member version of A New International.There has always been an innate theatricality to Smithrsquos work, ever since his early days fronting indie-pop troubadours The Starlets, who released three albums before the band morphed into A New International. This gave full vent to Smithrsquos penchant for mixing up music hall, showtunes and French chanson, all laced up with gypsy, flamenco and epic cinematic strings.ldquoWe were struggling a bit with our third album, Smith admits, ldquoso when The Dark Carnival came up it was a breath of fresh air. I love theatre that isnrsquot snobby or exclusive, and is for everyone. Thatrsquos why I love Oliver and Lionel Bart. Kurt Weill as well. Mac The Kne, people sing that at weddings and stuff. Thatrsquos filtered through to popular culture, and I like that.ldquoI think there has to be that connection, otherwise it becomes exclusive. Itrsquos one of the things Matt and I have spoken about. It would be great to get people who may not usually consider the theatre as being a good night out to come along, people who might normally go to gigs or concerts, because thatrsquos what it is. Itrsquos part gig, part theatre show, and in some small way we can try and dissolve that boundary, and have an environment where people arenrsquot afraid to sing along with the songs or laugh at the farcical moments and not be afraid of being farcical or funny. Sometimes that suggests yoursquore not being serious, but just because yoursquore being funny doesnrsquot mean yoursquore not.This is an attitude Smith has carried with him since he was a teenager.ldquoI remember going to see Elvis Costello perform solo at the Pavilion, he says. ldquoMy motherrsquos hairdresser took me, actually, but thatrsquos another story. I remember seeing him perform on his own, moving between guitar and piano, and I thought that was amazing. It just so happened there was a BBC Arena programme on either the week before or after, and that was the punk rock moment for me. Hersquos theatrical too. Itrsquos as much about his lyrics as his melodies. Irsquove always thought that melodyrsquos the thing that draws you in. Itrsquos like someone with good patter, but after that you want to know whatrsquos going on about them.ldquoBut it doesnrsquot feel like a leap to me me to be working in theatre. I remember, one of the first lightbulb moments for us as a band, wersquod been together for years at this point, trying to impersonate an indie band, but we never quite fitted in with that. We were invited to perform at literary cabarets which were a mixture of spoken word and music and suddenly realised we were probably a better fit for this audience than we were for indie venues.Later in the year, a pocket-sized unplugged version of The Dark Carnival will tour the country as part of the Touring Networkrsquos BRAW initiative. This will just feature Smith providing the music while actor Robbie Jack tells stories.

As of last night there are some new kids in town you need to gen up on fast. Why  Because they spring from the imagination of Andrew Davenport.The co-creator of global hit Teletubbies and the deviser of the equally successful Into the Night Garden is to childrenrsquos television what David ldquoThe Sopranos Chase is to crime drama and Galton and Simpson were to comedy. He is the godfather, but in a loving, doesnrsquot send anyone to sleep with the fishes kind of way. His latest irresistible offer to preschoolers is Moon and Me, the tale of a magical toy house whose residents come alive after dark.A preview on iPlayer created a buzz and now a series of five episodes runs every night this week.A blend of live action and stop-motion animation using low tech, hand-built puppets, Moon and Me begins with a child closing up a toy house for the night. ldquoClose your eyes, donrsquot you peep, this is the way we go to sleep, she tells her favourite doll, Pepi Nana.Once the light is off, Pepi Nana wakes up and starts saying her catchphrase: tiddle-toddle. Get used to it, people, as it is about to become as ubiquitous as chips.ldquoTiddle-toddle, tiddle-toddle, tiddle-toddle, trills Pepi Nana as she wakes up the other residents: Sleepy Dibillo, Mr Onions, Lambikins: Colly Wobbles, and Little Nana.Her next move is to write a letter to the moon, asking it to come for tea and tell everyone a story. As luck would have it, Moon Baby, complete with a fetching blue Mohican, is in residence and only too delighted to fly down and take everyone to Storyland.A delightful mix of sights and sounds and songs that the very young will quickly warm to, Moon and Me would make ideal pre-bedtime viewing. It is intentionally repetitive, relying on familiarity to breed contentment, and the narrator, Nina Sosanya , has a voice that is made to tell stories that begin with ldquoOnce upon a time, as they do here.Moon and Me might deploy modern programme making techniques, and be based on the latest thinking on childrenrsquos language development and play - Davenport is a speech therapist by training - but it has traditional elements, too. If once upon a time ainrsquot broke, why fix it With the trail blazed by Teletubbies and In the Night Garden, Moon and Me will not cause the furore Tinky Winky and company once did, with some parents complaining the characters were spouting gibberish. Thinking has moved on from then, and there is an acceptance that children learn language more successfully through play.So much for the science bit.

Now it is an urban wood, a park, a place for picnics and dog walks.Glasgow fancies more of this. Itrsquos not alone. Scotland ndash its hills once almost entirely bared of their natural tree covering ndash is gradually reforesting. And not just in the Highlands.Urban authorities are increasingly seeing trees as a fix for a whole range of problems. That includes land, even poisoned land, in neighbourhoods not too far from the Cuningar Loop.Just  per cent of Glasgow is wooded. That includes the gardens of the leafier parts of the West End or South Side.City officials in the Dear Green Place have long aimed for a higher figure.There has been talk of turning some of its gap sites into parks. But now planners are thinking more about woods, often wild ones. Sometimes they can just let nature take over.But they want targets.A view of the Clyde river walkway at Cuningar Loop during a come-and-try event at the woodland park.In a formal response to the Scottish Governmentrsquos recently completed consultation on reforestation, the city said: ldquoConsideration could be given to an indicator relating to the amount of vacant and or derelict land taken up by forestry planting.ldquoIn urban areas, in particular, vacant derelict land can be a blight on peoplersquos immediate environments and uptake for forestry can help contribute to a healthy and high-quality environment and help improve peoplersquos health, well-being and le chances.ldquoIf you decide to build houses later you can clear some of the trees, but have a head start on the landscaping in between.ldquoNo more sterile-feeling new housing developments, you get an attractive woodland setting without having to wait.ldquoDesirable housing estates are called ldquoleafy for a reason. So letrsquos not just have leafy suburbs.ldquoLetrsquos have leafy whole cities.Every party in Scotland has signed up to more urban trees. Speaking last year, Rural Economy Secretary and Highland MSP Fergus Ewing backed a Woodland Trust campaign to that end.He said: ldquoI want planting and maintaining trees and woodlands to be a shared national endeavour.ldquoThat applies to our towns and cities as much as it does to rural areas. There is a role for local authorities, public agencies, communities and iniduals all to play in this regard and I look forward to working with Woodland Trust Scotland and other partners to ensure that everyone gets to benefit from the positive contribution that trees can make to urban le.Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw MSP ndash who represents a leafier suburb, Eastwood to the south of the city ndash said: ldquoAs someone who regularly enjoys walking in the countryside, I encourage everyone to experience the benefits of an energising good walk.ldquoInitiatives such as this are a welcome step to ensuring that more people have access to trees and forests in their local area.Scientists have long argued for more urban trees. They do not just turn CO into oxygen to breathe, but their canopies trap particulates that poison our air.A study in Chicago found trees removed nearly  tonnes of pollutants every day. Some , people in the UK die early because of air pollution, according to some estimates.Another study, in Tokyo suggested that the presence of spaces such as tree-lined streets was associated with the longevity of senior citizens, as it promoted walking.As the Clyde bends round the Cunigar Loop, there is a now a boardwalk.It is routinely filled with East Enders."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-industrial-wastelands-to-be-turned-into-forests","story":"Glasgow and other towns and cities are understood to be looking at trees as a way of filling in large areas of derelict land.Urban councils have long wanted to have more woods for their citizens to enjoy ndash and to clean both their air and their ground.Every political party in Scotland has signed up to a campaign by the Woodlands Trust to plant more trees in urban areas.Now Glasgow has specically asked for the Scottish Governmentrsquos forestry strategy to have targets for planting trees on gap sites.The Scottish Government is currently crunching responses to its own wider strategy as it continues its plans to re-wood the nation.Less than one-fth of Scotland, some  per cent, is covered in trees, about half the average for European nations. Cities ndash thanks to parks and gardens, public and private ndash can be more wooded than the national average. Tree cover was measured at % or above in Perth, Inverness and Stirling.But it falls to just under % in Dundee, % in Edinburgh, % in Glasgow and just % in the city of Aberdeen.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council: ldquoThere are multiple benefits that can potentially be drawn from planting new woodland on vacant or derelict land.ldquoUrban woodland assists with carbon reduction, enhances bioersity in places which maybe otherwise deficient, helps to manage flood risk and acts as a barrier to city noise among many other positive environmental impacts.ldquoBut planting on derelict land also leads to aesthetic improvements for communities, while encouraging increased physical activity as people make greater use of previously unattractive spaces.The Glasgow spokesman said: ldquoThere are derelict sites that naturally regenerate into woodland with tree species such as birch, willow and alder commonly taking hold along with ground flora and urban wildle.ldquoWhether to pursue planting or allow natural growth would require assessment on a site-by-site basis.ldquoAn appropriate balance would also have to be struck between fostering urban woodland and ensuring development of sites could continue, particularly for housing.Experts stress the healing powers of trees - both for people and for land and air. However, city planners are also excited about the ability of small urban woodlands to protect against flooding. A  per cent rise in tree cover, they say, can reduce surface off-flow by %.George Anderson of the Woodland Trust, which champions native trees, said: ldquoWe need more trees and they donrsquot have to be in the open countryside.ldquoAside from the broad positives boosting bioersity, fighting climate change and cutting flooding, urban trees create huge direct benefits for human health and wellbeing.ldquoWe breathe easier and think happier with trees nearby.ldquoThere is huge potential for Glasgow to improve citizensrsquo lives through planting derelict land. Successive Scottish and UK governments have pursued rural reforestation, often despite opposition from those who want to keep Scotlandrsquos hill as they are, gamekeepers and mountaineers.Tree cover across the country has gone from around % at beginning of the th century to % at its end, largely thanks to commercial timber plantations and the state-owned Forestry Commission.There is currently a target to raise that area to % by . That would mean planting , hectares of wood a year, the equivalent of more than all the land currently categorised as vacant.Scotland is not always achieving that rate of growth.

Doesnrsquot seem much morally right about that  As Low, quoting Eric Hobswam, puts it: nationalists donrsquot really care about anyonersquos country but their own.Aside from Brexit, there are many reasons people do not believe that there is a case, moral or otherwise, for independence: devolution has demonstrated that on a political level at least, politicians in the Scottish Parliament, of whatever party, are no more effective than those in Westminster. Our public services are in the exact same position as those in the rest of the of the UK, with the management and oversight of these bordering on inept police and fire centralisation, and a nine years council tax freeze, which has forced councils to cut services relied upon by the less well off, spring readily to mind.

The biggest improvement in participation with FIT was among those living in the most deprived areas - up from .% to .%.Professor Robert Steele, the Dundee-based cancer surgeon who now chairs the UK National Screening Committee, said the results were fantastic.He said: \"Weve seen a substantial increase in uptake - far more than we were expecting, which is great news. Also the uptake has been greater among the hard-to-reach groups, particularly those people living in deprived circumstances.\"We cant be absolutely sure of the reasons but we think that its because, firstly, its an easier test to do. It only needs to be done once. The old test had to be done three times and I think people just got fed up with it.\"The other reason is that, on asking people about this test, they seem to trust it more. They think it looks more scientic than the old card system, so there is a perception that this is a more accurate test - which indeed it is.\"The latest figures on the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme show that % of Scots sent the new FIT test between November  and April  ed a stool sample for testing, up from % from the same six-month period a year previously when the older Faecal Occult Blood Testwas still in use.It is the first time since bowel screening began in Scotland that participation has exceeded %.There have been fears, however, that the increase in uptake is putting pressure on Scotlands diagnostic services, with waiting times for colonoscopies on the increase. Just .% of bowel cancer patients whose disease was detected through routine screening started treatment within  days of referral in July to September last year.The screening data shows that the percentage of positive results from screening rose from .% under FOBT to .% using FIT - but only around six in every  patients who test positive from screening actually turn out to have cancer.Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, welcomed the increase in screening participation but warned that staffing had to be adequate to meet deman.She said: ldquoWhile the increased sensitivity and accuracy of FIT means we can detect more people who have bowel cancer, it also means more people who have traces of blood in their poo but who donrsquot have the disease will be referred for further diagnostic tests. This, together with more people taking part in screening, will undoubtedly put more demand on an already overstretched endoscopy service leading to hospitals breaching waiting time targets.\"What we need now is for the Scottish Government to implement their plan of action to tackle the endoscopy crisis. Until then, patients will continue to wait too long for tests that can diagnose bowel cancer or give them the all clear.However, Prof Steele, who was closely involved with the UKs earliest trials of colorectal cancer screening in the s, said most referrals for colonoscopies were not the result of routine bowel screening.He said: \"It does pose a problem, but maybe not quite as big a problem as you might think. Screening actually only contributes a relatively small proportion of the total colonoscopy workload. If we were to reduce the number of screening colonoscopies it wouldnt have a huge effect on the number of colonoscopies.\"Screening is available to anyone aged  to  in Scotland, although older Scots can opt in. Kits are sent to all eligible addresses and once ed, stool samples are analysed for traces of blood at the central screening centre in Dundee.The test is particularly good at detecting cancer at an early stage, with around two thirds of those cases picked up through screening between May  and April  being found at stages one or two.Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said: \"We know that the earlier a cancer is detected, the greater the chances of successful treatment and often cure.\"This is why we launched our Detect Cancer Early programme in  backed by a pound million investment.\"Screening remains one of the most effective ways to find bowel cancer early and help reduce health inequalities in cancer outcomes.\"This is why Im delighted to see one of the biggest improvements was amongst those living in deprived areas.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bins to be collected once every three weeks in new council strategy","story":"Aberdeenshire residents will be encouraged to become recycling champions with the introduction of a controversial three-weekly collection programme.The revised waste strategy for all , properties in the Shire was approved in a - vote by the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee despite an alternative option from Peterhead SNP councillor Stephen Smith who said it was “too much, too soon”.From April next year, households will have weekly kerbside collections for one of three bins including a  litre bin for paper and card and  litre bin for metals, plastics and cartons.However under the new scheme, the existing general residual bin for non-recyclable waste will be signicantly reduced to a  litre capacity.Councillors were told by waste director Philip McKay that while it was a considerable reduction, the service felt it “should be manageable for most households”.He added that while a three-weekly non-recyclable waste collection might feel a bit daunting to residents initially – as did the move from weekly to fortnightly collections in Aberdeenshire a few years ago – experience from other Scottish local authorities showed that it is workable and can lead to a signicant increase in recycling rates.Mr McKay also stressed that given the larger recycling capacity provided in the favoured option, it provided “more flexibility in the future” for the addition of other recyclable materials without the need for additional recycling containers.Councillors were told that the scheme had the potential to save waste services £, per year at the lower end of the scale and even morethere was a higher uptake in recycling.However, Peterhead councillor Stephen Smith said the proposals as they stood were a step too far for North-east communities.In a bid to address concerns about the potential impact of any necessary changes to the waste strategy, he proposed that instead of using a -litre bin for three weekly collections, Aberdeenshire Council instead do what has happened in much of the rest of Scotland and keep the  litre bin for three weekly waste collections, with new  litre bins – which are expected to be funded in large part by ‘Zero Waste Scotland’ – being used for paper and card recycling for a transitional period.Councillor Smith’s proposal – which he claimed would have saved an estimated £, annually – followed confirmation from council officers that such a proposal would be compatible with Zero Waste Scotland’s requirements for helping to fund the cost of the new bins required.But council depute leader Peter Argyle warned against “changing horses” halfway through the programme as it would only lead to confusion.He told the committee that with an imminent landfill ban on biodegradable waste “coming down the tracks” by , it was “unacceptablewe don’t recycle” and questioned how people would be encouraged to recycle morethey continued to have the larger residual waste bin.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..!

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

I must admit the arrival of the man who handled the aftermath of the  Glasgow terrorist attacks with such aplomb and dealt with the financial crisis – to which he may or may not have contributed – a year later knocked me for six. His presence fair disrupted the usual workout of  minutes of uphill walking on the treadmill while listening to New Order’s greatest hits – and they say men can’t multitask.Anyway, his arrival and the new BBC programme Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil in which David Cameron gets booted from pillar to post like a giant Ribena berry between the likes of Merkel and Sarkozy got me thinking about retirement.Not my retirement, rest easy readers, but the retirement of politicians.It seems like there’s a lot of mostly  to -something “talent” out there who are busy working on other things, side hustlesyou like, when they could still be involved in politics.Labour seems to have been hardest hit by this with the loss of David Miliband, who quit the rough and tumble and headed to the US in , not long after losing the leadership election to his bacon-butty-bothering wee brother Ed.Surely a Bros-style documentary chronicling the demise of the brothers’ relationship followed by a reconciliation and the inevitable comeback tour beckons.When pigs fly.David has gone down well stateside, and is something of a media dahling among the liberal elite in his role as president of the International Rescue Committee. He’s being touted as the next leader of a centrist political party in the UK which may give millions of people currently wandering in the political desert something to vote for.Ed, rightly or wrongly, cops the blame for opening up membership of the Labour Party to anyone willing to pay their three quid. Not a bad idea in theory, but oft cited as the principal reason the Bolsheviks led by Jeremy Corbyn were allowed to seize power. : Brexit: David Cameron doesn’t regret calling referendumCorbyn, who at  is two years older than HWSRN, and four years old than Tony Blair, yes I’ve mentioned the B-word, is living proof of the old adage “ you hang around the barbershop, you’re bound to get a haircut”.At , Blair is still seven years younger than Donald Trumpet but has the small problem of the Iraq War to contend with every time he opens his mouth. I for one can’t concentrate on anything he’s saying – and he has been speaking a lot of sense on Brexit – without a giant “WAR CRIMINAL” klaxon exploding in my head.The decision to take us to war with Iraq in  continues to haunt the Labour Party. That and the perception of taking the electorate for granted, especially in Scotland, has left them to endure years in the political wilderness. David Miliband will be hoping the public give him the benefit of the doubthe does , when he says he voted for war based on the belief Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction. He would certainly bring a bit of experience to proceedings and would be a much-needed voice of reason in these turbulent times. Quite rightly, there’s no way back for Blair but talented performers like Yvette Cooper need somewhere  to shine and a new Centrist party could be the answer. Of course, there’s a host of chancers who have ridden off into the sunset having got a bit of the old politics on the CV. George Gideon Oliver Osborne is one.The -year-old manchild was last seen chilling out in his new £ million sky-chalet in Verbier. Then there’s SirNick Clegg, , who has been telling anyone who’ll listen how nice and responsible Facebook is while he trousers a hefty sum and they reportedly pay -year-olds for access to their web activity. Excuse my prejudices but I’m not having guys who appear to dye their hair to hide the grey bits, surely an anachronism today, and, like crown green bowlers under the age of , they’re worth the watching.: Lesley McLeod: From my Westminster bubble, I helped create Brexit – and I am ashamedKnighthood-avoiding “Call Me Dave” Cameron is bound to be struggling as it’s reported he’s finally let the builders into his Cotswolds pile after  years of planning. Expect some Alan Partridge-style chat with the workies as -year-old Dave explains to Polish labourers why they may end up being sent home post-Brexit.Scotland is a dferent story, in that I’m struggling to think of anyone who used to be in politics who is a loss to the profession, HWSRN aside. Douglas and Wendy Alexander are still in their s and Jack McConnell is only  – so a new Centrist party might be attractive to a generation of former politicians who may or may not still have something to offer. That nice man Willie Rennie might even be persuaded to jump shipa Centrist party were to take off. Whether the ex-politicians want the grief of the social media circus that the job now brings is a dferent story. I haven’t mentioned any SNP politicians as they’re still in power and enjoying everything that goes with it – for now. But my point is that a schism in the Labour Party, the rise of populism – and I include the SNP in that – and the Conservatives lurching to the right towards Jacob Rees-Mogg and his mates has opened the door for a new party.As I left the gym, I couldn’t get the former Prime Minister out of my head. Does he buy his own tray bakes or have them delivered I know he’s busy with charitable projects but he’s just one of an increasing number no longer in the political arena who would bring a sense of maturity to the current shambles.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4867897.1549363647!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon holyrood has seen scotland diverge from the uk","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Parliament has seen Scotland \"chart a dferent course from the rest of the UK\", Nicola Sturgeon has told a US audience.The First Minister reflected on this years th anniversary Holyrood celebrations and said Scotland has erged from Westminster in key areas like tax and education.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardIncrease in animal plastic litter issues Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PPP | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PPP | Article Teaser\"ldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely.

Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardPorsche vandalised in KenilworthTravelling after Brexit - how it impacts data roaming and driving abroad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"ldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just . We need to keep funding research so that more lives can be saved.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcdaid double ends stars cup hopes","story":"Irish Cup Sixth RoundLarne Crumlin Star A SECOND half brace from David McDaid crushed Crumlin Star#s dreams of a place in the last eight of the Irish Cup as runaway Championship One leaders, Larne fought back from a goal down to claim the win at a sunny and cold Inver Park on Saturday.The Ardoyne side dared to dream when Joe McNeill put them into the lead on  minutes, but the hosts drew level on  thanks to a Jeff Hughes header and after the break, they went ahead when McDaid converted what looked a harshly awarded penalty after Hughes# shot hit the arm of Ciaran Hughes and the ex-Cltonville striker make sure of victory with a late goal.Star were far from disgraced in this game and their large support could be proud of their team#s efforts on the day as they put it up to the Premiership-bound opposition who were laden with players who have played at the top level including former Reds in McDaid, Martin Donnelly, Tomás Cosgrove and Conor Devlin.In front of a big crowd that added to the occasion, the visitors opened with confidence and two minutes in, Devlin had to get down to his right to claw Barry McKervey#s free-kick around the post for a corner that led to a shot from Mark Lyons flying wide right.Larne gradually got to grips with the early pressure and looked to move the ball quickly in order to find gaps in the Star defence.Their first chance fell to McDaid who didn#t get hold of his shot and it was easily saved by Shane Harrison.On nine minutes, Martin Donnelly weaved his way past a number of challenges from the right and found himself just yards out, but he elected to place his shot rather than put power behind it with the goal at his mercy and Harrison was able to get down to stop it and get his behind for a corner that was aimed at the back post, but McDaid headed just too high.Star remained a threat and were always looking to create an opening # something they did to perfection on  minutes when brothers, Aidan and Joe McNeill combined to perfection with Aidan playing a perfectly-weighted ball in behind the Larne defence with Joe beating Devlin to the ball and lted it over the goalkeeper and into the net to send the away support into raptures.The pressure was now on Larne and they bombarded Star in search for the equaliser.Patrick McNally # a replacement for the injured Shane McEleney # headed over from Tomás Cosgrove#s shot and Cosgrove then saw his shot at the near post saved.The hosts were getting closer and on  minutes, the goal came when Hughes rose to meet Donnelly#s corner from the right and thundered a header high into the net.The momentum was with Larne and Donnelly then saw his brilliant free-kick saved onto the post and cleared by Harrison, while on the stroke of half-time, Cosgrove#s curling effort from the edge of the box went just outside the post with the goalkeeper beaten.With the sides level at the break, it was all to play for and both tried to establish themselves early in the second period.Chances were thin on the ground with Larne#s Jeff Hughes hooking a th minute effort well off target, but they really should have gone ahead on  minutes when Cosgrove cut in on the left and rolled a good ball across the face of goal to McNally a couple of yards from goal, but he inexplicably lted the ball over when it looked much easier to score.Larne did get their noses in front on  minutes from McDaid#s penalty, but Star certainly felt the award was hard as Hughes# shot at goal seemed to just hit the arm of Burns who had no time to get out of the way, but a spot-kick was the decision of referee Shane Andrews and McDaid made no mistake, firing high into the net.Star now needed a goal, but they were unable to carve out any clear chances with Larne looking to put the game away and Martin Donnelly had a couple of chances, but couldn#t find the goal his performance deserved.Instead, it was left to McDaid who swept home in the final minute from Lee Lynch#s cross from the right to seal his side#s passage into the quarter-final.LARNE: C Devlin, C Ramsey, T Cosgrove, J Hughes, L Lynch, S McEleney , F Sule, G Kelly, B Tiney , M Donnelly , D McDaid.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

I believe that the work that I set out to do is completed and that RRCANI now has a good foundation which they can continue to build on.”She added: “It is amazing what we all achieved in a relatively short period of time, most times relying just on friendships and a lot of good will. A heartfelt thank you and very well done to you all. I hope you will continue the good work with the Roma communities.”Remarkably, recipients of the email include her line manager at LORAG and the community group’s CEO Gerard Rice – both of whom Ms Long now claims were aware of her concerns. Both say they were not alerted to any concerns with the project until issues were raised by the Belfast Trust in late May .Another recipient of the email is her then fellow LORAG worker in the RRCANI project, spokesman for the Roma community of Belfast, Nicolae Nicola. Ms Long now says that he was the person charging vulnerable Roma for services, a claim which remains unproven and which Mr Nicola vehemently denies. Also copied into the email is Ms Long’s husband, Stephen Long.LORAG Chairperson John Gormley said: “We reject the claim that was broadcast on the Nolan show. LORAG had previously told the BBC Nolan Show that the first we became aware of an allegation of charging by RRCANI was through a conversation on or about  May  with Belfast Health and Social Care Trust officials.

A majority has rejected the current backstop. The EU must now accept the need for the Withdrawal Agreement to be reopened. The toxic backstop must be dealt with.\"The DUP leader said her party wanted \"an orderly exit from the EU which works for London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels\". She added: \"It is possible but requires political will.\"This is not a time for intransigence. It is time to respect unionists and nationalists alike in Northern Ireland and deliver a deal which is sensible and practical.\"The DUP leader said she was \"encouraged\" by comments from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney suggesting \"a hard border can be avoided in any circumstance\".\"It is important that the scaremongering about barbed wire and checkpoints is exposed as nonsense,\" she said.\"Border communities should not have genuine fears exploited with such tall tales.\"Meanwhile in Westminster, the working group bringing together senior Eurosceptic and former Remain-supporting Tories will continue its efforts to agree alternatives to the backstop along the lines of the Malthouse Compromise. Talks involving Conservatives including Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Steve Baker and Owen Paterson - along with former Remainers Nicky Morgan and Damian Green - will continue in Whitehall, chaired by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The first meeting yesterday was described as \"detailed and constructive\" by the Brexit department. But in Brussels there was little sign of a willingness to reconsider the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Barnier said the deal agreed by Mrs May and the leaders of the  other EU members \"cannot be reopened\". He said the EU was \"ready to work on alternative solutions during transition\", re-stating Brussels position that the backstop had to remain in place unless and until a replacement could be agreed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU was ready to listen to proposals to solve the border \"riddle\", but needed to hear from the UK how it thought this could be done. Mr Coveney said alternatives to the backstop were \"wishful thinking\". He said: \"The Irish protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement already allows for alternative arrangements or alternative solutions to the backstop andtheyre there they can replace the backstop. The problem is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements stand up to scrutiny, we have certainly not seen any that have.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37785608.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/May-Belfast-visit.jpg","title":"theresa may says commitment to avoid hard border in ireland unshakeable","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I will not let that happen.Theresa MayFacebookTwitterTheresa May said she was \"determined\" to work towards a solution to the Northern Irish border question that can command support from across the country, as she reiterated that there will be no hard border.She said: \"I know that the prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the Withdrawal Agreement creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, because it is here that the consequences of whatever is agreed will most be felt.\"I recognise too that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain and that many will feel that once again decisions taken in Westminster are having a profound and in many cases unwanted impact in Northern Ireland and Ireland.\"So Im determined to work towards a solution that can command broader support from across the community in Northern Ireland.\"Mrs May added: \"We stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border - including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls.\"Mrs May said: \"I know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland.\"But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland, that commands broad support across the communities in Northern Ireland and that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.\"As we do so, I hope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution, so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent.\"For, ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Irelands history must be more than whether we avoid ato the challenges of the past. It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future.\"As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it is a profound honour and duty to play my part in shaping that future and to do my utmost to support the peace, prosperity and progress that can give the people of Northern Ireland the brightest future for generations.\"Asked how she could convince the people of Northern Ireland to accept a Brexit deal which was stripped of the backstop, Mrs May said: \"Im not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesnt contain that insurance policy for the future.\"What Parliament has said is that they believe there should changes made to the backstop.\"And it is in that vein, in that light, that we are working with politicians across Westminster, across the House of Commons, but also will be working with others - with the Irish Government and with the EU - to find a way that enables us to maintain our commitments that we have set, very clearly, for no hard border, but to do it in a way that provides a Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration for the future that can command support across the House of Commons and therefore that we will be able to raty with the EU such that we leave on March  with a deal.\"Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle ONeill accused the Prime Minister of a \"dangerous political U-turn\" over her stance on the backstop.\"Theresa May must understand that no amount of warm words and platitudes will be acceptable to Sinn Féin, citizens or businesses here,\" she added.\"Only the legally binding backstop can guarantee certainty, prevent a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement framework. We told Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer this yesterday and we will tell Theresa May that tomorrow.\"The DUP do not speak for the people of the north of Ireland - and are doing a huge disservice to our people, businesses, farming industry and key sectors of the economy by misrepresenting our interests.\"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: \"Despite claims that upon entering Number  [Theresa May] felt her most profound responsibility was to serve the interests of the people of Northern Ireland, her actions have shown otherwise.\"We will be very clear tomorrow that the future of Northern Ireland cannot be left to majorities in England and Wales. The British Government must deliver a deal that does not undermine the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, and the only plausible way to do that is to deliver on the Backstop.\"Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the backstop beaches the Good Friday Agreement and urged the Prime Minister to remove it from the Withdrawal Agreement.\"I welcome the fact that even the DUP now recognise that the Belfast Agreement secures Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom,\" he said.\"Anyone who understands the Belfast Agreement knows full well that the backstop is incompatible with it and the Government needs to make this point loud and clear. Once that basic fact is recognised and accepted by Dublin and Brussels, then perhaps we can make real progress.  \"The Withdrawal Agreement and the Backstop must be amended to respect the Belfast Agreement and to both recognise and defend the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.”"},{"url":null,"title":"half of children live under a mile from school but twothirds take car to gates in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the stalemate between their party and the DUP in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, the Labour Party’s Brendan Howlin said the Fine Gael government “seems to have adopted a Celtic Tiger attitude for

I want to be very clear about that.”He added that in the worst case scenario there would be checks in place on goods coming from UK to Ireland because the UK would become a third-country.Asked by Mr Doherty what would happenthose goods came across the border, from Newry to Dundalk into the Republic, Mr Donohoe replied: “That will have to be subjective engagement that we have with the European Commission.”Mr Donohoe told committee members that the risk of a disorderly exit had increased in recent weeks and thatit came to pass the Department of Finance has predicted that the economy would slow by % more thanBrexit did not happen and by .% more than the Government’s current trajectory which factors in a deal being made between the UK and the EU.He added that the unemployment rate would increase by an estimated %, relative to Budget  projections, and that the most adverse impacts are likely to be felt in agri-food and indigenous manufacturing sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"bp sees annual profits more than double","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you swipe left another dog profile appears.Two friends, Emily and Elena, recently scanned the app and then visited the SOS Gyvunai shelter in Vilnius to meet Pf, a medium black-and-grey mongrel. They took him for a walk in a snow-covered park and said they wouldsoon to take him home.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The creators of GetPet hope to match stray dogs like this one to new owners Gecevicius said the app only features dogs for now but the plan is to eventually include cats and other animals.“I think it’s actually a very great idea because in Lithuania we have a lot of stray dogs and a lot of people who want to adopt,” -year-old Elena said as dogs nearby ran around in outdoor cages barking.Ilona Reklaityte, the shelter’s founder, said she is very happy about the innovative approach to an old problem.“I really welcome this new app as it gives us more chances to find our pets new owners and a new home, and that means we can then help other dogs still on the streets,” Reklaityte said. “We have  dogs right now. Sometimes we give away one or two of them every day, but now we receivemore calls and people are coming more often.”"},{"url":null,"title":"russian activists raise alarm about captured whales","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Russian law only allows for the capture of whales for “scientic” or “cultural” purposes.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The marine containment facility in Srednyaya Bay near Vlaostok But activists believe the whales have been captured for sale to foreign amusement parks.Local animal rights activists say the cramped conditions and low temperatures threaten the whales’ lives.“There are very small chain-link pens,  to  baby whales are put there and have to be on top of each other,” said activist Nina Zyryanova. “Now it’s getting colder every day. Although these animals are native to the Arctic, they must move, hundred kilometres a day, to stay warm.”The marine containment facility in Srednyaya Bay near Vlaostok has been investigated by Russian prosecutors who have already called the capture illegal.Kirill Parkhomenko, assistant to the Vlaostok environmental prosecutor, said that four Russian companies caught the animals after they obtained a permit from the Federal Fishery Agency. The prosecutors believe that this permit was obtained illegally because the company cannot prove that it is engaged in any scientic or cultural activities.Whales are worth a fortune on the black market, and the activists believe that they were captured for sale to amusements parks in China.The whales are kept at one location but are owned by four separate companies. Company records and court filings, however, indicate that the companies are connected.In an interview with Russian state TV last year, a representative for the facility rejected reports of poor treatment of the animals.One of the companies, Bely Kit, unsuccessfully sued the Federal Fishery Agency in  over its refusal to issue it a quota for capturing unidentied marine mammals. The  ruling shows that Bely Kit had a standing contract with a company in China’s northeast and that the company was unable to prove that the whales would be kept in good conditions and used for educational purposes. The city of Weihai in the Shandong province hosts an ocean amusement park.Several owners and managers at the four companies have been previously fined for illegal capture of the whales."},{"url":null,"title":"derry pupils cook storm win place big school cook off final","story":"Pupils from a Derry school have qualied for a major cooking competition.After an outstanding display of talent, creativity, technical skills and local knowledge, St Cecilia’s College Year  pupils Roise McLery and Dearbhail O’Donnell have won the County Derr regional final of the Mount Charles Big School Cook Off, earning them a place in the grand final of the country-wide cookery competition taking place next month.The St Cecilia’s College team’s dish of Kedegree Fish Pie served with Braised Leeks and Peas saw them take the top spot.They will join seven other teams from across Northern Ireland and Donegal to take part in the final stage of the  Mount Charles Big School Cook Off in association with the Irish News and SuperValu.Special guest Imelda McCarron, a contestant from the BBC’s Great British Bake Off, will join the judging  for the grand final.Each of the teams taking part in the final won a regional heat where they competed against other teams from their county, with a total of  schools taking part in this year’s competition and two heats taking place in County Antrim due to the sheer volume of entries.Nearly  dishes were entered into the first stage of the contest, with only the very best making it as far as the regional heats and the teams that were successful at those heats are now preparing in earnest for the grand final at Belfast Met’s Titanic Quarter campus in March.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMay McGuire, teacher at St Cecilia’s College, said: “I’m just delighted for the girls.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

And ensuring that the unique needs of this part of the UK are met has been one of my chief priorities ever since I became Prime Minister.Any border that weaves its way through farms and villages, bisects hundreds of roads and lanes, and which is crossed and re-crossed by thousands of people every day would pose a logistical challenge in the context of Brexit.Prime Minister Theresa May leaving Downing Street to travel to Northern Ireland to make a high-profile speechBut when you add to those geographical factors Northern Ireland’s complex history, the dferent traditions and identities that make up its community, and the long path to peace that the people of Northern Ireland have walked over the last forty years – the challenge is even greater.Over the last two and half years, we have come a long way towards a solution that works for Northern Ireland and Ireland.We have agreed mutual protections for citizens’ rights, the maintenance of our common travel area, and set a framework for our future relationship that ensures tarf and quota-free trade and protects our close co-operation on security and law enforcement. But the UK Parliament rejected the Withdrawal Agreement because of their concerns about the backstop – the legal protocol to prevent no hard border in the event our future relationship is not in place at the end of the implementation period.I know that many people in Northern Ireland, and indeed across this island, are worried about what Parliament’s rejection of the withdrawal deal means for them.So I am here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the United Kingdom Government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.To affirm my commitment to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to its successors the St Andrew’s Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement, and to the principles they enshrine – which is absolute.And to affirm my commitment to delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which is unshakable.I was  when the Troubles began and  when the Belfast Agreement was reached for all my adult le, Northern Ireland has been a central political issue. The progress of the last few decades – from the Troubles to ceasefire from ceasefire to political agreement and from agreement to active participation by unionists and nationalists in institutions that enjoy cross-community support – has been a massive achievement and a landmark in the history of these islands. From the moment I became Prime Minister of the UK, I knew that one of my most profound responsibilities was to serve the interests of the people of Northern Ireland by doing all I could to protect and sustain that progress.Third person dies after Tyrone crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Successive UK and Irish Governments have played their parts, often working together in close co-operation.But it has been the political parties in Northern Ireland – the UUP and the SDLP, the DUP, Sinn Fein, and the Alliance – it has been civil society groups like WAVE and Healing Through Remembering - and above all it has been the people of Northern Ireland who have achieved by far the most.Violence has not been eliminated. But it has been reduced to levels that would once have seemed impossible to imagine.Divisions remain entrenched in some communities. But many people, including those from the younger generations, are more and more interested in putting aside those isions to build a shared future.Thanks to greater political stability, Northern Ireland is now a leading destination for inward investment, with over  international businesses investing in its economic success. Employment is at a near-record high and unemployment at a near-record low. And that transformation is reflected in the image that Northern Ireland projects to the rest of the world today.It is no longer one of violence, but of dynamism and success. And the decisive moment in that transformation was the Belfast Agreement in . Its success was in allowing people of dferent traditions to feel that those traditions and their identities were respected, and that they could work together to build a successful future for all the people of Northern Ireland.It enshrined the principle that it is the ‘birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identy themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.’And it enshrined the consent principle: that it will always and only be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what their constitutional future should be – and that the UK Government is solemnly committed to supporting and implementing their democratic wishes. These principles are the bedrock of peace and stability in Northern Ireland.And they will forever be honoured by the United Kingdom Government.A fundamental belief in the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and Unionist – and that will never change.But the Unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.And the United Kingdom I stand for is an open and tolerant union of nations and people.A country where every religion, every peaceful and democratic creed, has a place and every man and woman is equal before the law, treated with respect and has the opportunity to get on and succeed. Indeed, that Union can only ever be secure and prosperit is built on that respect and acceptance of dference and ersity. Because the Belfast Agreement is not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland, its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom.Our absolute commitment to those principles has informed and directed my approach to Brexit – from my first speeches as Prime Minister to my first meetings with the Taoiseach.And in December , in the Joint Report we agreed with the EU, we committed to protect the  agreement ‘in all its parts…and to the totality of the relationships set out in it.’…‘to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls’…and ‘to preserving the integrity of the UK internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it.’These were commitments made in good faith. Our preferred approach has always been to deliver them through the Future Relationship.But I accepted the need for an insurance policy or bridging arrangement to guarantee no hard borderthe Future Relationship was not in place in time. And that such a policy had to deliver legal certainty – through what is called a legally operative text - so it would give people and businesses on both sides of the border clarity and confidence over how these commitments would be fulfilled.That is why I agreed to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. And unlike the original European Commission proposal, it did not impose a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Many people, businesses, farming organisations and voluntary groups in Northern Ireland agreed with me. They spoke out in support of the Withdrawal Agreement and they defended the backstop. I know that wasn’t an easy thing to do and I am grateful to them for doing so. I fought hard to make the case for the deal as it stands. I believed it could command a majority in the House of Commons.But I have had to face up to the fact that in its current form it cannot. And the need for changes to the backstop is the key issue. While there were those in Northern Ireland who spoke in favour of it, it is also true that the backstop is not supported by the two main Unionist parties here.And this also influenced MPs in England, Scotland and Wales in voting against the deal. I can only deliver on the commitments we have madeI can get a deal through the UK Parliament.And meetings with MPs across the House showed that I can only get a deal through Parliamentlegal changes are made to the backstop.And that is why the UK Government – and a majority of MPs from across the House of Commons - supported the amendment from Sir Graham Brady last week. It reaffirms our desire to leave with a deal and our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. And as Sir Graham himself set out, it would mean replacing the backstop with another arrangement which avoids a hard border or making legally binding changes to the backstop to introduce a time limit or create an exit mechanism.I know that the prospect of changing the backstop and re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland. Because it is here that the consequences of whatever is agreed will most be felt. I recognise, too, that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain. And that many will feel that once again decisions taken in Westminster are having a profound – and in many cases unwanted – impact in Northern Ireland and Ireland.So I am determined to work towards a solution that can command broader support from across the community in Northern Ireland.As we do so, there are a number of commitments that will underpin our approach and which must be part of any alternative arrangements that we seek to negotiate with the EU and pass through the UK Parliament. First, we stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls.And this means people on either side of that border will be able to live their lives as they do now. I have spoken to people in places like Fermanagh who remember the customs border posts, approved roads and security installations of the not-so distant past. I have spoken to businesses who have supply chains that cross between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland. I understand how thousands of people move back and forth between Northern Ireland and Ireland every day – to go to work, to visit family, even to do their shopping. I understand what a hard border would mean – not just in terms of the disruption at the border itself, but in terms of trade for the whole island.The Belfast Agreement delivers “just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities.” And for many a seamless border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is integral to delivering this.And I know this has been the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity. And I will not do anything to put that at risk. So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.Second, neither will I compromise on my promise to protect Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK. When the European Commission proposed a version of the backstop which involved creating a customs border in the Irish Sea, I successfully resisted it. And I have ruled out anyto such a suggestion. This would not only damage the integrity of the UK’s internal market which is so vital to businesses across the UK – and not least here in Northern Ireland.It would also ignore the very real concerns of many people about being cut off from the rest of the UK. Furthermore, we will also ensure there will be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Northern Ireland’s institutions having their say.Third, there will be full protection for all existing cross-border co-operation. Many areas of cooperation have been identied – both those formally set out by the North South Ministerial Council such as cooperation on health and transport, or keeping the island of Ireland disease-free for animals and plants……and informal areas of co-operation such as a single integrated electricity market that supplies power to everyone.Every area of existing cross-border co-operation must be respected. If these are ever to change in the future, it will be a matter for Belfast and Dublin in accordance with the three-stranded approach, not as a consequence of our EU exit.Fourth, we will uphold the rights enshrined in the Belfast Agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland, right across the whole community. This includes upholding commitments around mutual respect, religious liberties, equality of opportunity, tolerance and rights.I know that there are some in the nationalist community in particular who worry that some of their existing rights could be eroded when the UK leaves the EU.So we have already enshrined in the Withdrawal Agreement a legal guarantee of no diminution of equality and rights.There have also been serious concerns raised about how UK immigration rules treat citizens here exercising their rights under the Agreement to be Irish.The birth right to identy and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the Agreement.But I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered dficulties in securing their rights as Irish citizens to bring in family members. I understand the serious concerns that have been raised.So I have asked the Home Secretary, working closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to review these issues urgently to deliver a long term solution consistent with the letter and spirit of the Belfast Agreement. Without a devolved Government - and with only unionists represented in the House of Commons - it is more important than ever that we uphold our duty to ensure all voices in Northern Ireland are heard. I take that very seriously indeed and the UK Government will always work in the interests of the whole community.So tomorrow I will be sitting down with the political parties to discuss the way forward and ensure that we can deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish Government or the European Union to prevent ato borders of the past. The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen. At the same time, we must continue to support all efforts that can lead towards the restoration of Northern Ireland’s political institutions. And the UK Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that when an Executive is restored it will have real influence to speak for all the people of Northern Ireland as we shape the UK’s future relationship with the European Union. As we work to address the unique challenges that Brexit poses to Northern Ireland, so I also want to ensure that we continue to maintain – and indeed enhance – the strongest possible bilateral partnership between the UK and Ireland.I have said many times that I want to see a new, deep and special partnership between the UK and the  Member States of the European Union. But our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other . It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography. The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history. Ireland remembered the centenary of the Easter Rising in an inclusive manner which promoted a greater understanding of our often troubled history.While our two countries remembered together the shared sacrice of so many who fought side by side in the First World War. The ceremony at Messines in , attended by HRH the Duke of Cambridge and former Taoiseach Enda Kenny was particularly poignant, as it remembered the soldiers of the th Irish and th Ulster Division who both played a key role in the Allied victory in that battle.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been. And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.So I want to work closely with the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government, as so many of our predecessors have before, to strengthen the bilateral relationship we have built. And this can and should take many forms.We already have the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and regular Summits between UK and Irish politicians. But as we leave the European Union, we will need to establish new ways of coming together to develop further our unique relationship.For example, the Irish Government has suggested annual meetings where the Prime Minister and Taoiseach, together with senior Ministerial colleagues, come together to discuss the big issues of the day.We will also want to strengthen our economic relationship and have already together identied areas like construction and smart cities as ripe for enhanced collaboration.And both the UK and the Irish Governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup Bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this.We also want to find creative ways of enhancing the links between all our peoples – and in particular, to build the links between our young people. I know there is a sense that many British people do not know enough, or understand enough, about the complexity of the long relationship between the UK and Ireland. And a sense that some Irish people are less familiar with the forces and motivations that help to shape views in the UK. So as part of these new ways of coming together, I would like to us to look in particular at opportunities for our young people to discuss these issues and others in a structured way and to reflect on their vision for our future relationship.I know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland. But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland……that commands broad support across the communities in Northern Ireland… …and that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.As we do so, I hope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent. For ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Ireland’s history must be more than whether we avoid ato the challenges of the past. It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future. As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it is a profound honour and duty to play my part in shaping that future… …and to do my utmost to support the peace, prosperity and progress that can give the people of Northern Ireland, the brightest future for generations.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I will not let that happen.”Prime Minister Theresa May speaks with business representatives at Allstate in Belfast on her Brexit plans on Tuesday February , . Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireBut asked how she could convince the people of Northern Ireland to accept a Brexit deal which was stripped of the backstop, Mrs May said: “I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future.“What Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop.”It was in that light that she was working with MPs, the Irish government and the EU to find a way to meet the commitment to take Britain out of the EU on March  with a deal which avoided a hard border, she said.Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Thursday for her first face-to-face talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker since the Withdrawal Agreement they reached last November was rejected by the House of Commons.She will seek to secure changes which can persuade MPs to support her deal in a series of votes expected on February .• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastMPs voted last week for an amendment tabled by Conservative grandee Sir Graham Brady and backed by the Prime Minister which “requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.There was immediate concern from Conservative Brexiteers over Mrs May’s apparent indication that she was instead seeking “changes” to the backstop arrangement, intended to keep the border openno broader trade deal is reached after Brexit.A source from the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs told the Press Association: “Evenshe doesn’t mean what she said, we still do.”Challenged over whether she had made a U-turn, Mrs May said: “There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this - it’s been called an insurance policy, the backstop - that ensures thatthe future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.”In her speech to an audience of Northern Irish business leaders, Mrs May said she wanted to “affirm my commitment to delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which is unshakeable”.IN FULL: Theresa May’s speech in Belfast Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Prime Minister acknowledged the importance of a seamless border and how the current arrangements had helped “deliver peace and prosperity”.She said: “While I have said that technology could play a part and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Mrs May added: “Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent ato borders of the past.“The UK Government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”She announced a review by Home Secretary Sajid Javid of issues surrounding dficulties faced by residents of Irish nationality in bringing family members into Northern Ireland.And she pledged to work with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to “continue to maintain - and indeed enhance - the strongest possible bilateral partnership between the UK and Ireland” after Brexit.• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8790363.1548852258!/image/image.jpg","title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport      Driving tests cancelled at some NI centres - amid ongoing weather warningsDriving tests have been cancelled today in some areas due to the adverse weather conditions.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop.

Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
