I did not know what lies she had told the police.\u0027Mr Atkinson said: \u0027You were trying to get her alone\u0027Waterson asked him: \u0027Is it a crime to be alone with your partner?\u0027He added: \u0027I have already admitted lying in the beginning, I have pleaded guilty to it, lies were told, I did not want to get anyone in trouble.\u0027 His girlfriend Adrian Hoare, 23, was in the back seat with Alfie and Hoare said he looked upon the boy as his son.          Adrian Hoare, 23, allegedly put Alfie  in the footwell and did nothing to help him as he screamed out for her          Waterson told jurors that he lied to police because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualifiedWaterson told the Old Bailey he lied to police after the incident because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualified.Two days after Alfie was injured Waterson went in search of a new car.Mr Atkinson asked him: \u0027Why did you start looking for a new car?\u0027Waterson said: \u0027I buy and sell cars not just on that day on every day.\u0027If you are asking about the Audi, no, I was still driving it.\u0027The prosecutor asked him: \u0027Is it a coincidence then is it that as Alfie was going from fit and well to unconscious and dying that you started trying to sell it?\u0027Waterson answered: \u0027I sold it because I felt sick every time I got in the car.\u0027Why? Because the boy I looked on as a son had died in the backseat of it\u0027.          Waterson is accused of ramming his seat back (pictured) into Alfie, crushing him against the back seat. The car was sold days laterMr Atkinson said: \u0027The reality is that during the car journey pressure was applied to Alfie that stopped him being able to breathe.\u0027Waterson told the court that he could not see what was going on behind him.Mr Atkinson asked him if the chair met resistance.He replied: \u0027If the chair met resistance I would have stopped.\u0027Waterson said the chair \u0027went, back then forward, then stayed there\u0027.Waterson admitted the car was overloaded but said he could not remember how many times he had crammed too many people into the car.          Dr Barbara Judge, mother of Stephen Waterson, outside the Old Bailey On February 5 last year Waterson received a text from his mother, Barbara Judge asking him what was going on and why he was with Emilie Williams.Waterson\u0027s reply was read out in court: \u0027I explain please don\u0027t be mad I wasn\u0027t planning on staying I was going home and please don\u0027t say my address to anyone please don\u0027t want anyone knowing where I live.\u0027Mr Atkinson asked him: \u0027Was that you asking your mother to lie for you?\u0027Waterson replied that he did not want anyone knowing his address and his parents did not like him having people there.At the time he was living there with Hoare.\u0027The deal was that if they were paying the deposit with me that no one would be around my flat.\u0027 Alfie died three days after suffering a cardiac arrest outside the home he shared with the couple in Croydon, south London.Hoare and Waterson deny manslaughter.Hoare also denies charges of child cruelty for placing Alfie in the footwell and common assault on Ms Williams on February 14.Waterson further denies intimidating Marcus Lamb, also known as Marcus Richardson, on 15 February.But Hoare and Waterson, have admitted perverting the course by submitting false statements to police.The trial continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/06/10/06308062000007D0-0-image-m-6_1549450056830.jpg","title":"Splits Labour Emily Thornberry says Venezuela needs new elections","story":"    Labour\u0027s splits over Venezuela were exposed today as Emily Thornberry (pictured today at PMQs) called for new elections and backed sanctions against the regime          Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured last week) - a long-standing admirer of Mr Maduro\u0027s socialist predecessor Hugo Chavez - has strongly condemned outside interference in Venezuela \u0027whether from the US or anywhere else\u0027          Maduro has shown no signs of bowing to the pressure, warning that he could not rule out civil war if the protests against his regime continuedSpain, Germany, France, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Lithuania have all joined in recognising Mr Guaido, who proclaimed himself interim president on January 23. In her speech today, Ms Thornberry said: \u0027Under a Labour Foreign Office, I can ... guarantee there will be no indulgence of human rights abuses because they are committed by less powerful countries, or by governments who call themselves \u0027socialist\u0027 but who, by their actions, betray every socialist ideal.\u0027  Ms Thornberry told an event at the Institute for Government in London on Wednesday: \u0027What I am saying is that we begin with dialogue.\u0027That offer has been made, internally and externally we need to ensure that happens.\u0027Fury as Tusk says there is a \u0027special place in hell\u0027 for...Donald Trump will visit London in December for a Nato...Share this articleShe added: \u0027That\u0027s the best way to proceed rather than somebody saying \u0027that\u0027s it, we\u0027ve had enough, we recognise X, we don\u0027t recognise Y any more\u0027.\u0027That\u0027s not the way to treat another country, even a country in as desperate a situation as Venezuela.\u0027Ms Thornberry said she was a \u0027great believer in sanctions\u0027 as a way of using foreign policy muscle \u0027that doesn\u0027t involve killing people\u0027.Mr Maduro has shown no signs of bowing to the pressure, warning that he could not rule out civil war if the protests against his regime continued.\u0027I don\u0027t accept ultimatums from anybody.

Right: his home on Coronation StreetCharlie Fairfield has been a prominent figure in Casualty since 1986, and the average semi-detached property in Bristol has increased from £43,845 to £474,225 - a staggering increase of 982 per cent. Yet Charlie\u0027s modern-day NHS wage of £26,252 means he would be priced out of the market by more than £68,000, meaning his annual income would have to be £94,845 in order to be accepted for a mortgage. Emmerdale\u0027s Eric Pollard would also struggle to get his foot on the housing ladder today, as a detached house in Arncliff has increased by more than 2,000 per cent in value since he arrived on the show in 1986.          Each soap stars average salary for their job, required income for a mortgage now and the affordability gap between what they earn and need for a mortgage Based on the average income of B\u0026ampB owners, Eric would be nearly £63,000 short of the £91,937 income required to secure a mortgage.  The longest-serving soap star included on the fitures, Christine Barford of the Archers, would have been on around £54,000 as a stable owner before she retired.Having bought in 1953 for little over £2,000, the price of a detached home in Cutnall Green would have increased by 21,355 per cent today.Yet were she to buy today, she would be just over £44,000 of the £98,992 needed to secure a mortgage.          Eric Pollard, as played by Chris Chittell, would struggle to afford his property if he were buying it today  The Grange Bed and Breakfast in Emmerdale The same goes for Tony Hutchinson, Ken Barlow, Jac Naylor and Hywel Llywelyn, who would all be priced out of their respective local markets if they tried to buy today.  Only Jimmi Clay could afford his property today with his GP salary of nearly £70,000 when securing a mortgage in Birmingham. Alastair McKee, Managing Director of One77 Mortgages, commented: \u0027Unfortunately for our best-loved soap stars, the cost of getting on the ladder today would see many of them resigned to the rental sector.           Graphic shows the average price when the characters moved into their home compared to what it is in the current housing climate          Only Jimmi Clay could afford to buy the property he now lives in, according to new figures\u0027Luckily for them, they took that first step when prices weren\u0027t as high and as a result have benefited from some very healthy price growth across the board. \u0027Of course, this research is just a bit of fun and in many cases mortgage affordability would be bolstered by a partner or spouses\u0027 income, but it does raise a more serious issue. \u0027Regardless of property type, profession and location, there is a huge disparity between the price of UK property and the wages on offer and it highlights the struggle facing many aspirational buyers today when trying to secure a mortgage.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle calls Meghan bulls story imaginary pals praised princess","story":"    Brave: Meghan Markle (above last Friday) was praised in a glowing People profile that featured interviews with five anonymous friends who were tired of seeing the princess be bullied          Counterpoint: \u0027#PeopleMagazine this article is total bulls*** there are plenty of text messages and receipts to prove otherwise.

EU Council President Donald Tusk earlier caused online chaos as he said there was a \u0027special place in hell for Brexiteers\u0027Labour wants commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, as well as \u0027unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases\u0027.Mr Corbyn also calls for further talks with the PM \u0027with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together\u0027.The Labour leader tells the PM that last month\u0027s rejection by MPs of her Withdrawal Agreement means a different approach is needed.He writes: \u0027Without changes to your negotiating red lines, we do not believe that simply seeking modifications to the existing backstop terms is a credible or sufficient response either to the scale of your defeat last month in Parliament, or the need for a deal with the EU that can bring the country together and protect jobs.\u0027The Labour leader states: \u0027There is, as was demonstrated last week, a clear majority in Parliament that no deal must now be taken off the table and that there can be no return to a hard border in Northern Ireland in any circumstance.\u0027We recognise that any negotiation with the EU will require flexibility and compromise.\u0027Our first priority must be a deal that is best for jobs, living standards, our communities, in the context of increased and more equitable investment across all regions and nations of the UK.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/21/5060084900000578-0-image-m-8_1537302336573.jpg","title":"Supermodel Christie Brinkley said felt younger 65 whats spirit age","story":"    Supermodel Christie Brinkley celebrated with friends and family at her 65th Birthday party in New York last TuesdayI have a clear memory of staring at the long looking-glass in my mother\u0027s bedroom on February 6, 1969 — my 6th birthday — and thinking: \u0027This is the business!\u0027 I was wearing the uniform of a school where I was about to become the youngest pupil and I felt I had escaped kiddiehood.A. A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.MARRIAGE GAVE ME THE MIDLIFE BLUESHenry DeedesReal age: 40. Spirit age: 28.          Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young.

The company says it has not been able to complete part of the fracking process – injecting sand after water has been pumped in – without breaching the threshold.Chief executive Francis Egan called for the limit to be raised but did not say where he wants the tremor level to be set.‘All we ask now is that we are treated fairly, with comparable seismic and ground vibration levels to similar industries in Lancashire and elsewhere in the UK,’ he said.

Cyberbullying, online predators, harassment and disturbing content have all been identified as dangers for children online, with experts warning of the impact on mental health – especially when combined with poor sleep and a lack of exercise.Dame Sally said: \u0027Time spent online can be of great benefit to children and young people, providing opportunities for learning and skills development, as well as allowing young people to find support and information.\u0027But we need to take a precautionary approach and our advice will support children to reap these benefits and protect them from harm.\u0027Experts last night welcomed the guidance as simple, straightforward and achievable.       The family of schoolgirl Molly Russell have found it \u0027impossible\u0027 to discover potentially vital information about what she viewed online in the hours before she killed herself.Her parents – who have accused social media companies of contributing to her death – have been unable to gain access to both her Apple iPhone and iPod Touch, which are both encrypted.They have also been hamstrung by efforts to access the 14-year-old\u0027s social media accounts, which do not become accessible to parents even if a child dies.Molly\u0027s father Ian Russell told the BBC: \u0027There is data on her electronic devices that we can\u0027t access because it is locked in there.

The stakes could hardly be higher. An amicable orce that is not destructive, or a messy break-up which would leave a lot of wreckage behind. There are only 50 days left . . .Which brings me to Martin Selmayr and his zip.Though not much known in this country or even in his native Germany, Selmayr is a big cheese in Brussels, where he serves as Juncker\u0027s deputy. He has a fearsome reputation.Juncker has affectionately called him the \u0027monster\u0027, while less indulgent souls at the European Commission have nicknamed him \u0027Rasputin\u0027 or \u0027Darth Vader\u0027. Visiting British officials have simply called him a \u0027psychopath\u0027.As you\u0027d expect, Selmayr is normally in the second group I\u0027ve mentioned — sticklers who rigidly uphold every jot and tittle of EU rules and regulations, and won\u0027t contemplate any sort of pragmatic compromise with Britain over the backstop.Perhaps he\u0027s still in this camp, along with that inveterate critic of Brexit, Donald Tusk. Yet in a meeting with British MPs in Brussels on Monday, he showed a surprising degree of flexibility.          German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is in the \u0027reasonable camp\u0027 that wants Britain to have an acceptable Brexit dealI\u0027m going to stick out my neck. I predict Brussels will propose some sort of legal guarantee that Britain can\u0027t be made to stay in the Customs Union against its will if no solution to the backstop is forthcoming.The reason I believe this is that the self-interest of democratically elected governments — many of which are appalled by the prospect of No Deal — is likely to triumph over the ideologues at the European Commission.Admittedly, these purists — Juncker, Tusk and Michel Barnier — have made the running during the negotiations as they did their utmost to deliver a punishment beating to Britain that would deter any other country from leaving their fledgling superstate.Donald Tusk admits hopes of holding second referendum to...QUENTIN LETTS: Hell surely has a special shelf for the...Will the EU wipe the smile off Theresa’s face?

In particular, economic conditions in Europe have deteriorated to an extent that wasn\u0027t foreseeable even three months ago. Italy is in recession, while France and Germany are teetering on the edge of one.One could say that Britain is fortunate to be negotiating with Brussels when the EU is suddenly and unexpectedly weak. Theresa May, despite her recent tribulations, may be inely blessed.Although no one can be sure what the effect of No Deal would be, there have been many studies suggesting it could precipitate already floundering economies, including Germany\u0027s, into a severe recession.Who would want that? Not elected leaders, obviously. Not Angela Merkel, who has been listening to petrified German car-makers — already weakened by the collapse in diesel car sales, and the looming threat of stiff U.S. tariffs.Britain is their biggest single market. About one in seven cars manufactured in Germany is sold in this country. The tariffs which would follow No Deal are the last thing they need.          President of the European Council, Donald Tusk (right) and Prime Minister of Ireland Leo Varadkar during a press statement after a meeting on Brexit in Brussels yesterday And France? Despite all the posturing of that preening narcissist Emmanuel Macron, I can\u0027t believe he really wants irate French farmers marching down the Champs-Elysees complaining that British markets are closed to them.Mrs Merkel\u0027s attempts at conciliation over recent days suggest that at long last Europe\u0027s politicians are publicly flexing their muscles, and are unlikely to allow Brussels dogmatic bureaucrats to call the tune.Indeed, Martin Selmayr\u0027s deftness with zips is probably evidence of this. He has close links with the ruling Christian Democrats in Berlin. Isn\u0027t it likely that this normally obdurate EU functionary is being leaned on by the German government?So I repeat my prediction that a significant concession on the backstop will be offered by the EU over the next few weeks. Ireland\u0027s hysterical concerns over its border with Northern Ireland won\u0027t be allowed to plunge Europe into recession.But will such a final deal be accepted by the hard-line Brexiteers? And the Democratic Unionists? There, I am far less sure. We have our own hardcore of purists and ideologues who may be more doctrinaire than their counterparts in Brussels.Martin Selmayr is unzipping. Even the sepulchral Donald Tusk, with his repeated abominations of Brexit, will probably be side-lined by real-life politicians.But our own ultras?

But there are a few signs of the promise Koons showed before he embraced BanalityMuch taller and more bulbous than I am, Jeff Koons’s Balloon Venus reflects the viewer on every bulge and curve of its magenta-coloured, mirror-polished stainless-steel body. The reflections are meant to make us feel somehow included, though all those twists and eruptions remind me of strangulated hernias or a monstrous yet cutesy haemorrhoid.Making a balloon sculpture from the late paleolithic stone statuette known as the Venus of Willendorf – an object that could sit comfortably in your hand – then using a CT scanner to fabricate this vastly enlarged version strikes me as excessive. The original tender stone-age figure, rediscovered in Lower Austria in 1908, sits in a museum in Vienna, while Koons’s Balloon Venus is exhibited in the middle room of his show at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.Balloon Venus stands among larger-than-life polychromed stainless-steel ballerinas – all based on east European porcelain figurines – whose makers might, just might, have once glimpsed a reproduction of a Degas dancer. Their execution is a marvel. I would call them breathtaking but for the queasiness of their belated rococo frivolity. The eye slithers over their shiny surfaces. I can imagine Hermann Göring loving them.Various classical floozies look out from a number of paintings. Their photographically derived forms are overdrawn with blownup graffiti riffing on Courbet’s 1866 L’Origine du monde – which is to say, scribbled vulvas. One large image depicts actor Gretchen Mol riding an inflatable dolphin, while ogling a blowup monkey toy. Koons says he realised at some point that the monkey was Eros, and that Mol, in her acting role as 1950s pinup model Bettie Page, was the goddess Aphrodite. Ah! Antiquity!Dizzy with the air-headedness of it all, I can’t even get into Koons’s sexual politics in this room of female fancies – never mind the skills and the quality of craftsmanship involved in every stage of their misconceived execution.I like the basketball in the aquarium best. It greets you as you walk in. Hovering in midwater, this is the earliest work in the show. Koons’s One Ball Total Equilibrium Tank from 1985 is a reminder of the promise he once had, before he embraced Banality. Then came the inflated silver bunny, the carved kids and the happy pig, the blue gazing ball in a pristine birdbath. The first room in the exhibition takes us from 1985 to 2013 in four easy steps, providing a precis of his ascension into decline.But maybe his art was always iffy, as we critics have it. According to the catalogue entry to the basketball piece, Koons had the help of “Nobel prize-winning quantum physicist Richard P Feynman” in devising a method for keeping the ball hovering at the right depth (the trick involves distilled water and salt). Whether he needed the brainpower of Feynman to get the job done is questionable, but anything that adds extra oomph and glamour, or a flashy backstory, is fine by Koons. As the late singer-songwriter Reg Presley recommended in the notorious Troggs Tapes, a sprinkling of bastard angel dust over the fucker always helps.In the last room, Koons’s version of Titian’s painting Diana and Actaeon is a remarkably accurate transcription of the 16th-century original, right down to the pattern of cracks in the surface, although I haven’t counted the number of arrows in Actaeon’s quiver, or the leaves on the trees. It is but a few centimetres smaller than the original. What really gives the game away, apart from the lack of Titian’s impasto brushwork, is the large blue blown-glass ball resting on a little shelf affixed to the lower part of the canvas.A further transcription, of Géricault’s Raft of the Medusa (1818-19), is a great deal smaller that the French artist’s original, and appears to have been copied from a digital image that shows the original painting prior to its most recent cleaning. No matter. All this is interesting, but only insofar as Koons, or rather his army of assistants, should have devoted so much time, skill, technology and, most of all, money to the devoted reproduction of these and other paintings and sculptures. “Every brushstroke is applied by hand,” the wall text tells us, and “each glass ball is hand blown, and for each one that is sufficiently flawless to be used in an artwork, around 350 end up being rejected.”The works in the last room of the exhibition, with their references to Titian and Rubens, to French Romanticism and classical sculpture – the Belvedere Torso, Praxiteles’s Silenus with baby Dionysus, appended with these perfect blue balls, fulfil an art historian’s fantasy of the continuity of tradition – and a secret desire for the end of art.One cannot compare the stupendous lengths Géricault went to in creating the Raft of the Medusa (storing body parts, including severed human heads, in the studio as models for his emaciated figures) with Koons’s mostly fiscal labours, in keeping his show on the road. Koons’s art is too expensive to fail, I have heard it said. It will survive as a paradigm of folly and excessiveness, less to be looked at, more to be gawped at."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd7009f39bc16c0b0e12f99a4b46c60c8e2be75/0_2607_7620_4573/master/7620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00537fb47d6b8e13345c30d3cdb9d43b","title":"michael spencer jones oasis definitely maybe album cover","story":"‘Halfway through the shoot, a Lambretta scooter arrived for Liam and he took off up the street with me shouting after him: “Come back!”’One of the first jobs I did was the cover for All in the Mind by the Verve. That one photo got me a lot of work – and on to Noel Gallagher’s radar. You already knew the Gallaghers were going to be stars. Some bands act really relaxed, but when you pick the camera up you’ve got four blocks of wood. Oasis weren’t like that. Their confidence was incredible.I went to have a recce and thought: “What are they going to be doing at the table? Playing cards? Having a seance?” There was no way I could see it working. Then I thought: “Well, if we have to do it in Bonehead’s house, let’s shoot in the lounge towards the bay window.”It’s a tiny room. I had to whack in a wide-angle lens just to get everyone in. But Bonehead had stripped floorboards – and with that lens, it looked like an advert for Ronseal varnish. It was a real problem. I’d not long ago been to the Egyptology section of the Manchester Museum and it came to me to have Liam lying on the floor in a kind of transcendental state with his eyes closed, like he’s not of this world. Is he alive, is he dead? I thought it’d be pretty surreal and also solve the problem of filling that space. I was nervous about mentioning it to Liam. Asking the lead singer to lie on the floor: a lot of bands wouldn’t have gone for that. But Liam was up for it straight away.The shoot was littered with Red Stripe cans, but there was no way I was having them in the shot, because it would just look like product placement. They wanted some reference to alcohol in there, though, so I said: “Let’s get some wine.” It’s actually Ribena in the glass, though. The urban myth is that it’s because they couldn’t afford wine, but that’s complete rubbish. When I was at art college, I learned that when you photograph “red wine”, you always use diluted Ribena, because wine just comes out black.Noel brought that Burt Bacharach photo, on the left, which is actually the inside of a gatefold sleeve. On the TV, Noel’s favourite film – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – is playing. One of the roadies brought in this inflatable globe, and I got a thread and hung it from the ceiling. Noel liked that. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Since I was going to use a long exposure, I thought: “I know, I’ll spin it and it’ll blur.”Liam had ordered a Lambretta scooter. Halfway through the shoot, there was a knock on the door and the scooter arrived. Suddenly everyone went out into the street and Liam was off on the scooter with me shouting: “Come back!”I knew it was a big gig. I’d heard the album and knew it was going to be massive. So I was totally focused – you have to treat some album shoots like the singles final at Wimbledon. Once I’d got everyone positioned and the globe was spinning, I looked through the camera and I was buzzing. I knew I’d got it.I get so many emails from Oasis fans. I went back to the house recently and spoke to the people living there now. Apparently this guy from South America had just turned up at their door wanting a look at the living room.

Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating. The mystery of how a 4-year-old girl ended up in the river and was rescued and where she came from are central and I can’t wait to find out.“I saw somewhere that 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first book in the Flashman series,” says RedmonT. “While I couldn’t care less about that, it did remind me how long it has been since I read them, so I’ve ed back in”:This morning, I finished the third in the series - Flash for Freedom - and am now about to start Flashman at the Charge. I think Royal Flash is by far the weakest of the series (though still brilliant) and Flashman and the Redskins the best. I urge you all to have a go at reading them if you haven’t already. As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?! Makes me wonder what else people do to their poor books.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville. Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website. Le Sistrot in Quimper stocks a wide range of craft and farm ciders.There’s also a long tradition of beer brewing in the region. Brasserie Lancelot was founded in 1990 and occupies the site of a gold mine in Roc-Saint-André, Morbihan. Seven unpasteurised beers are made here, each one named after a figure from Breton history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f900118a59d780579a9118fd216efa424b2080c0/0_44_5360_3217/master/5360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7454e4e5f1ee930f704a4c2cfd9ef549","title":"in the 80s it had life and energy readers react to sheffields struggling high street","story":"Last week, a  Cities article explored the steep decline in shops in Sheffield city centre and asked who was to blame. Reader reaction was swift and impassioned.So why is the problem particularly acute in the steel city? Readers had many thoughtful comments.Meadowhall, an out-of-town shopping centre which opened in 1990 and offers free parking, has long been cited as a contributing factor to the demise of shops in the heart of the city. Some blame the rise in online shopping, others a lack of vision by the city council. Local retailers, meanwhile, point squarely at high business rates.Of the many thoughtful comments below the piece, here are some of the best – and some potential solutions.Sheffield council seems in denial about Meadowhall. It’s huge and always busy so surely must generate the same amount of money as a thriving city centre destination like Leeds or Manchester? In that case why not just accept that Meadowhall is Sheffield’s ‘retail quarter’ with all the big chains, and invest in supporting independent businesses in the city centre with schemes to help pay business taxes. It was always the independent stuff that made Sheffield city centre an exciting place to visit - worth a detour after buying the boring bits at Meadowhall. Now there’s barely any of that left it’s just another soulless identikit place.You can drive to Meadowhall, park for free within a short walk of a comfortable air conditioned environment. Sheffield City Council have presided for decades over a policy which makes driving and parking expensive and difficult. A policy which effectively promotes Meadowhall to the disadvantage of the city centre.High Street shopping areas need to become smaller, more compact and more specialised - and business rates need radical overhaul. You can see this in big cities as well as smaller provincial towns such as mine. Our long high street is peppered with empty units and charity shops, yet cafes and restaurants are appearing and apparently doing ok. There is no future for big brand stores on most high streets, the answer is in more local, inidual, specialist outlets - but rates need to come down to allow them to thrive.So sad, when jobs go so does that sense of community. During the 80s I would work in Sheffield and like other similar cities, Nottingham, Leicester, Derby it seemed to have its own life and energy, it was a colourful, dynamic place, and I loved working there.A few years ago I visited Magna, a terrific place but there are many things this government needs to address if it is prepared to challenge the malaise rotting the heart of our communities. Perhaps I’m getting old in the tooth but something tells me it has neither the vision, the heart or the stamina.If it weren’t for John Lewis many people wouldn’t visit Sheffield at all. The tram to Meadowhall started the death of the city centre - Manchester made the right decision not to take the tram to the Trafford centre. It’s such a shame to see what’s happened to Sheffield. What I don’t understand is why it’s always so difficult to park - if no-one\u0027s shopping there, why are the car parks always full?Sheffield should take note of the successful case of Altrincham, Manchester. The centre was seriously depressed until one bold renovation project created a giant new restaurant. It proved so popular that people got fed up waiting in the queue and started using nearby eateries instead, where they could get quicker service.....England\u0027s Best High Street award shortly followed.There’s a lot of city centre living in Sheffield now, although there is an argument that flats attract a more transient population. It’s a strange city in that it has vibrant suburbs all around the immediate outskirts, so the main shopping centre can feel a bit underwhelming. Overall, a great place to live and socialise. Like most places outside London, it could do with more employment (meaning real businesses moving into the area, as opposed to everyone riding around on bikes delivering pizzas to each other).I keep seeing the arguments to try and ‘save’ high streets when what they really need is to change to become more service based and reflect what people want rather than hope to look like something ‘typical’jark44Sheffield City Council - yes they have had massive cuts to deal with but this is significantly exacerbated by poor and authoritarian leadership, a total lack of vision, seeming incompetence and very fraught local LP politics. They have completely lost the faith of most voters in the city.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c8aaaf3f74bb25f5e42a92235f07593ffa1ab18/0_315_1376_826/master/1376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b61d09226cbd208de3ff610cd6ec131","title":"john humphrys leaving today at last why dont feel triumphant","story":"The presenter has announced he is leaving the Radio 4 show later this year. Now that he’s going, I remember what I liked about himI woke up to the news in stereo: John Humphrys on the radio, being infuriating, and John Humphrys in the Daily Mail, making the announcement that he is to leave the Today programme, possibly as soon as this autumn. Harrrumph, I snorted. Only someone who is a thousand years old could call autumn “soon”.Railing against Humphrys has become the engine of my mornings, a tea tree shower gel and ginger juice bomb combined. On particularly bad mornings – when he is telling Jacob Rees-Mogg chummily that he knew his father – I have to get out of bed and fetch my laptop, because tweeting on my phone just isn’t fast enough. It is often hard to disentangle what I am angry about, between Humphrys, the Today programme and the BBC generally, but I don’t care. I have enough fury for all of them.Anyway, now he’s leaving, I don’t feel triumphant at all. I am thinking about the old Humphrys, the one who used to enjoy a bit of mischief, the one who wrote a sensitive and unexpected book about assisted dying, and I miss the political culture that made that Humphrys. I think we probably all used to be nicer and less Harrumphrys. I can’t imagine who would replace him. Today presenters, huh?

In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Donald Trump acknowledged that talks with the Taliban might not succeed, but that “the hour has come to at least try for peace” in Afghanistan, noting his country’s casualties. He did not mention the Afghans who have died (24,000 civilians since 2009, and 45,000 members of the security forces in the last five years), let alone the nation’s broader suffering in the world’s deadliest conflict. Around half of Afghanistan’s population was not born when this war began, in 2001. Their elders have lived with conflict for most of the last four decades, since the Soviet invasion.A country so fissured is united in its longing for peace as last year’s brief ceasefire, in which civilians, militants and soldiers celebrated together, showed. A US-Taliban agreement would be one step along that road. Yet Afghans ask at what cost a deal may come, conscious that those likely to pay the most are not negotiating the bill. Only two women are present at the talks between Taliban representatives and Afghan politicians, warlords and other powerbrokers in Moscow. These follow last month’s talks between US and Taliban negotiators in Qatar, which reached a draft framework under which the US would withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that the country would not harbour terrorists.The considerable obstacles that remain include, most obviously, the Taliban’s refusal to speak to the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, and his government. Hope for peace coexists with the fear that the US will leave as carelessly as it boosted intervention in 2017, when civilian deaths surged due to increased air strikes. The Trump administration’s lack of interest in human rights, and the president’s record of contempt for women’s rights, increases those anxieties.Women – and many men too – are frightened about the possible terms of an agreement and very aware that they would essentially be unenforceable once US troops were out of the country. They are rightly frightened that it could dismantle the gains they have made, which fall far short of what is needed – patriarchal values and misogyny are hardly unique to the Taliban – but are nonetheless real, substantive and precious. Research has suggested that peace agreements are more likely to be reached and implemented when women have a strong role in forging them, including – but not only – at the negotiating table. “Any peace that threatens women’s rights, freedoms and gains will not be sustainable,” a group of Afghan women warn in a statement this week. It is in the interests of the Afghan people as a whole that they should be included and heard, and their fundamental rights recognised.

In contrast, only 18,850 applications came from Wales, meaning that if those trends are sustained there will soon be more undergraduates from China studying at British universities than from Wales.Last year there were also more than 100,000 postgraduate students from China and Hong Kong at British universities, out of nearly 350,000 full-time postgraduates.Overall the numbers will come as a relief to the higher education sector, after widespread concern that the Brexit crisis would erode applications from within the EU and outside Europe.British universities have redoubled their recruitment efforts overseas, while for European applicants it may be their last chance to access lower tuition fees and student loans before Britain exits the EU. International students from outside the EU generally pay much higher fees and are not eligible for loans from the UK government.Clare Marchant, Ucas’s chief executive, said: “‘In this time of uncertainty, it’s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.”Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, which lobbies on behalf of British universities, said despite the latest figures the UK risked falling behind rivals such as New Zealand.“We are calling for a new graduate visa that will make the UK more attractive to international students, allowing a wider range of employers in all parts of the UK to benefit from access to talented graduates from around the world,” Jarvis said.“The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study,” Marchant said.The results came against a background of uncertainty over funding, with a review commissioned by Theresa May expected to recommend tuition fees be cut to £6,500-£7,000 from their current level of £9,250.“To drive social mobility and strengthen the economy, the current post-18 education review should recommend policies to support access for anyone who has the potential to benefit from a university education,” said Jarvis.Universities UK this week launched a national campaign asking the government to keep funding study abroad opportunities for British students if the UK cannot remain a member of the pan-European Erasmus student programme after Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57f4cf876d70d03e5905aa5c9d301dd4f8762d71/0_59_4462_2678/master/4462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c255747cea3f12fd5587d6b08917c2","title":"spelling bees no but they can do arithmetic say researchers","story":"Study says honeybees can learn to carry out exact numerical calculationsHoneybees can learn to add and subtract, according to research showing that while the insects have tiny brains, they are still surprisingly clever.Researchers behind the study have previously found that honeybees can apparently understand the concept of zero, and learn to correctly indicate which of two groups of objects is the smaller.But now they say insects can learn to carry out exact numerical calculations such as adding and subtracting a given number.“Their brain can manage a long-term rule and applying that to a mathematical problem to come up with a correct answer,” said Dr Adrian Dyer, co-author of the research from RMIT University in Australia. “That is a different type of number processing to spontaneous quantity judgments.”If the team are right, the insects are in good company. While it was once thought that only humans could manage such calculations, the authors note recent research has revealed a veritable menagerie of creatures can keep track of numbers or even add or subtract. The team say the latest research adds to a growing body of evidence, including human studies, that language is not necessary for learning how to manipulate numbers. And there’s more. “It is teaching us a lot about what brains can do and what necessary structures you might need in brains to achieve certain outcomes,” said Dyer.However, Paul Graham, professor of neuroethology at the University of Sussex, was cautious, and said it was not clear that the bees really did have a concept of mathematical operations, or even numbers.“In reality, you don’t really know what the animal has done, because you are not investigating how it is doing it,” he said, adding it was hard to design an experiment to rule out other, simpler explanations for the bees’ behaviour.Writing in the journal Science Advances, Dyer and colleagues describe how their research involved releasing bees into a simple maze in which they were shown a picture of a small number of coloured shapes. After flying through a hole, the bees were presented with two further images showing a different number of shapes.When the shapes in the set up were blue, insects that made a beeline for the image with one more shape than in the initial picture were offered a sugary drink. When the shapes were yellow, they were rewarded for flying to the image with one fewer shape. If the bee flew to the “incorrect” image, they were given a quinine solution – which is unpleasant to bees.“It is very hard to train a bee to understand a plus or minus sign because that is an abstract symbol, so we use colour because they learn colour very quickly,” said Dyer.Fourteen bees were involved in the experiment and each completed 100 of the training exercises, with the shapes and numbers – up to a maximum of five – chosen at random from a pool of possibilities.Each bee was then tested 10 times on two different scenarios for each colour.Crucially, the first image the bees saw in the test setups contained three shapes. Neither the number nor the particular shape used had been presented to the bees as the initial picture during training, meaning they could not choose the “correct” answer from memory.Dyer said the prevalence of numerical competence across the animal kingdom was “suspicious”, leading him to believe it might be a widespread phenomenon in animals that aids survival. However, he added it was difficult to test this, and said there was an alternative explanation – the real phenomenon is the ability to make associations and solve conundrums, rather than have or acquire numerical skills per se."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03718a88ba7d71186b6d19c7b34ee7a7e402b3e8/137_0_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f904c7e31ac2a67c119acd2371a81055","title":"cavity two thirds the size of manhattan discovered under antarctic glacier","story":"Disintegration of rapidly melting Thwaites ice mass could threaten coastal communities worldwideScientists have discovered a giant cavity at the bottom of a disintegrating glacier in Antarctica, sparking concerns that the ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected.Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years.In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier.The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice.But Milillo told the  the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice.Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock.Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas.Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide.Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.”There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions.The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said.Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”.“We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

One of the world’s most high-end foods colliding with the most basic to produce a strange, shape-shifting vision of fluidity in food form. It’s so on trend. And with its breaking down of barriers, its radical invention and its kicking down of the door to a whole new universe of possibilities, it quite possibly offers us a chance to taste the infinite. Either that or it’s just a marketing gimmick from Heinz (it’s celebrating 150 years of its inimitable red sauce). One way or another, I had to find out.Thanks to the ’s deadlines, the only night available for me to sample ketchup caviar was on my birthday. And so instead of eating a favourite meal, I got to eat a favourite meal that featured tomato ketchup in a starring role. That slightly limited the options, it has to be said, especially as I’m not one of those Trumpian monster who eats their fillet steak with lashings of Tommy K (although ketchup caviar is the kind of thing you would expect a Trump establishment to serve … in fact you can already hear him calling it “a very elegant food”).In the end I plumped for fish fingers, chips and peas. Spooning the tiny red balls on to my breadcrumbed fish certainly added a jolly interactive element to what was already quite clearly a pre-school meal. The finished plate looked ridiculous, but at the same time you could definitely imagine Heston Blumenthal sticking it on a £600 tasting menu, serving it with a children’s bedtime story printed on rice paper and watching as diners weep uncontrollably with childhood nostalgia.Of course there are other caviars on the market that don’t contain any caviar (cavi-nahs?). Ikea sells seaweed pearls made largely of kelp, while Holland and Barrett stocks a similarly vegan caviar. Condiment caviars, however, don’t seem to be available elsewhere and if Heinz ketchup caviar is anything to go by, there may be a reason for this: it doesn’t taste very nice.Yes, the balls keep their shape (although maybe a little too well – making it hard to coat anything in the sauce until it’s in your mouth). But the ketchup caviar is sadly thinner and more acidic than regular Heinz, and tastes more like an own brand sauce rather than the deep, rich delights of proper glass-bottled Heinz. To get the full effect of its globular nature you have to eat it on its own, and who eats ketchup on its own? (Maybe don’t answer that.)It’s a game attempt to reinvent the food landscape. But if you really want to enjoy a truly luxurious meal, then stick to eating fish fingers and chips with some proper tomato ketchup instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/529614c5c2620d16286252c726086074263e76fa/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce95e7148a74e56a0177155ff9b7f83d","title":"koike ya one hand chips greasy snacks clean phone solutions","story":"Pre-smashed One Hand Chips are far from the first to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestylesAmong the concerns facing today’s social media maven: how can one scroll through Instagram and enjoy a bag of potato chips without getting their phone all greasy?It’s a dilemma Steve Jobs was never able to solve, but that hasn’t stopped today’s innovators. A Japanese snack company is offering chips that require only a single hand to consume – and you don’t have to touch the chips at all. The Tokyo company Koike-ya is behind One Hand Chips, which come pre-smashed so that you can essentially drink them, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now you can swipe with clean hands, and while the calories pile up, you don’t have to waste valuable energy chewing. As one enthusiast tells the paper: “I can just take it and chug it.”Koike-ya is aware of the significance of its accomplishment, calling One Hand Chips “a new snack style humankind has been waiting for”, the Journal reports. But it’s far from the first company to tailor the dining experience around our phone-centric lifestyles.Nearly a decade ago, TechCrunch reported on the Potato Chip Hand. It’s a plastic stick with pincers on one end, forming a grabber that pleasingly mimics the white gloves favored by Mickey Mouse and Goofy. It emerged just a few years after release of the first iPhone.McDonald’s, meanwhile, has gradually refined its own tools to address the phone-grease conundrum. In 2017, it unveiled the Frork, which is a device to hold and dip French fries. Wooden chip forks are commonplace in the UK, of course – with the life-changing implication that fries can be a meal – but this was different. The beauty of the Frork was how the fries became a part of it, serving as makeshift tines that you could sweep through ketchup. The trouble was loading the holder with fries, which was essentially impossible without touching them, as the writer Tim Carman observed in a series of Washington Post pieces on fry-centric tech.Perhaps that’s why the brilliant minds at McDonald’s rethought the strategy last year. Instead of targeting the fries, they focused on the phone with the Frylus. Your hands might be covered in grease, but the tool allowed you to use your phone without touching it. Had Apple considered this innovation, perhaps the iPhone would have come with one from the start.According to General Mills, makers of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, you shouldn’t have to “choose between eating and posting” selfies, either. The cereal team invented the selfie spoon a few years back, as reported in Time and promoted in this horrifying music video.It’s a selfie stick with a spoon at one end. They are (or were) free – “Our awesome fans love to share their obsession with our cereal on social media so we wanted to show a little love back,” a marketing planner said on the company’s blog – but you do have to cover shipping. SelfieSpoon trumpets the fact that this is “really a thing”. They are sold out, presumably forever, but one is available for $50 on eBay.One-handed eating is not new. Chopsticks predated the Frork by roughly 4,000 years. There are also a number of longstanding snacks well suited to one-handed eating – I personally recommend granola bars. A word of caution, however: you’re probably better off keeping eating and Instagramming separate. Unsurprisingly, researchers have found that using a phone during a meal leads to less enjoyment. Presumably subjects were not using selfie spoons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7f2b980d5572184198a6e41cff99cf4820593e/0_339_3102_1861/master/3102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3747cbab6a557703e3cda1bb0cfd575b","title":"barcelona real madrid copa del rey match report","story":"• Copa del Rey semi-final first leg: Barcelona 1-1 Real Madrid• Malcom and Lucas Vásquez score in hard-fought drawThere was no Lionel Messi for an hour, no Gareth Bale either, and there was no winner but there were two Brazilians making their clásico debuts and making their mark, taking leading roles on the biggest stage.Vinícius Júnior, 18, made Real Madrid’s opening goal and Malcom, 21, scored Barcelona’s equaliser. If one might have been expected – excitement has been building over Vinícius at the Bernabéu, the sense of the emergence of a new star – the other was not: Malcom’s goal, scored early in the second half, was celebrated with relief as well as joy.His first months in Barcelona have not been easy. His first half here was not, either. But nobody was more involved than he or Vinícius – one on the left wing, the other on the right – and he scored the goal that means the tie hangs in the balance. In the end, with Messi playing only half an hour, there was no way of separating these sides. “There was so much quality out there,” Santiago Solari said after a special night for two Brazilians.Vinícius has led Madrid’s recent revival – enthusiasm running through everything he does and proving contagious, some light amid the darkness – and he led them here as well. Defeated 5-0 last time they came here, this time Madrid were a goal up after five minutes. And it wasn’t even their first attack. Vinícius ran at Nélson Semedo for the second time, shifting the ball on to his right and sending a cross over Jordi Alba to where Karim Benzema was waiting. Benzema pulled back for Lucas Vázquez to score.At every stage of the move, Barcelona arrived a moment too late and in the opening stages that pattern was repeated all over the pitch. There was a tentativeness about them that Madrid took advantage of: Solari’s plan to rob and run, reinforced by the early lead, reaped rewards. Ivan Rakitic was the first man caught out, followed by Philippe Coutinho and Sergio Busquets. Each time, they found Vinícius going at them fearlessly.First, Gerard Piqué had to e to block Vinícius. Next Vinícus scuffed a shot, supplied by Benzema. And then, dashing away, his pull-back just evaded Benzema. That chance come as a warning, a reminder of Madrid’s threat at a time when Barcelona had started to wrest back some control. Another pass from Vinícius set up Toni Kroos, who shot over.At the other end of the same flank, Malcom was becoming a focal point too. He should have put Barcelona level, played through by Luis Suárez on 20 minutes, only to shoot straight at Keylor Navas. You could almost feel his insecurity – but he did not hide. In fact, he was the player Barcelona sought most, finding space in a familiar place: behind Marcelo. The ball went out to him repeatedly, but didn’t always come back in. Willing to run, he was not always able to find the telling pass, and at times was exasperating, but what the Catalans did create largely came from him. On the other side, Coutinho did little, timid again.Piqué headed Malcom’s clipped free-kick just over Navas blocked Semedo after Malcom had slipped him in and then another delivery was headed against the bar by Rakitic. He then wriggled free and found Suárez, whose shot was saved brilliantly by Navas. He remained erratic: when it opened up for him soon after, he gave the ball away to groans from the fans.And yet he would delight them soon enough, when Clément Lenglet’s long pass early in the second half sent Alba sprinting into the area. Navas got out but the ball ran free to Suárez, whose superb shot hit the near post, running across to Malcom. He controlled and, with time to think and to doubt, struck past four men into the net.Barcelona were level, and then Messi was on, entering the fray with Arturo Vidal, Casemiro, and Bale. He was immediately involved, and the ball was Barcelona’s. Messi won a free-kick that he bent into the wall, then almost ran free. But opportunities were few, Malcom and Vinícius having been substituted off. Messi appeared to be choosing his moments, handbrake on, and the best chance fell to Bale when Benzema found him after Marc André ter Stegen failed to clear fully. Inside the area, the goalkeeper gone, Bale was slow to shoot and was closed down. Piqué ed to block another shot, this time from Kroos. At the other end, Sergio Ramos ed too, stopping Messi as the final minute slipped away. There will be at least 90 more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b5834f8df4ffbf6e8a6c43b7e9d4120918b5486/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6453fcd0ae77ba7e3ee19ff4c4578781","title":"nantes demand transfer fee from cardiff city for emiliano sala","story":"Cardiff City have been left shocked and dismayed after Nantes demanded the first instalment of the transfer fee for Emiliano Sala, who was on board a plane that went missing a little over a fortnight ago.It is understood that Cardiff received a letter from Nantes on Tuesday, in which the French club threatened to take legal action if the first scheduled payment is not received within the next 10 days.Although Nantes were entitled to the first slice of Sala’s reported £15m fee by now, there is a sense of disbelief at Cardiff given the circumstances and the timing. The plane that Sala was travelling on was only discovered on Sunday and the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) has not said whether the body spotted in the wreckage, which was found on the seabed, is that of the Argentinian striker or David Ibbotson, the pilot.Nantes emailed Cardiff last Thursday in relation to the payment terms and the Welsh club’s failure to transfer the first of three instalments. They then followed up that message five days later with a more direct demand that referenced possible legal action.From Cardiff’s point of view, the priority is to establish all the facts around the tragedy. There is no suggestion that the Welsh club will not meet their contractual obligations, but at the moment there is a desire and determination to gather all the relevant information first – and that could mean waiting until an official investigation is completed.Sala was insured by Cardiff after signing for the club on 19 January, two days before his ill-fated flight back from Nantes, where he had returned to say goodbye to his former teammates. It is believed that Cardiff have a player insurance policy of £16m per inidual and that Sala was registered under those terms on the morning of 21 January.All the while, the AAIB is continuing with their operation, after the plane was found 67m underwater, 21 miles off the coast of Guernsey in the English Channel. An official search for the Piper Malibu was called off on 24 January, when Guernsey’s harbour master, David Barker, said the chances of survival after such a long time were extremely remote.A privately funded search for the plane, backed by Sala’s family and thousands of people who donated money as part of a crowdfunding exercise, got underway on Sunday, and the plane was found within two hours.Conditions, however, are far from ideal. An AAIB spokesman said: “We are attempting to recovery the body. If we are successful, we will consider the feasibility of recovering the aircraft wreckage.Strong tidal conditions mean we can only use the remotely operated vehicle for limited periods each day and this will mean that progress is slow. Regardless of the results, we will not be making a further statement until the families have been informed.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39803c97afc5db63dc23576ef78c23c07e22d900/82_94_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=308a882d557b7b477a453104801027e4","title":"west bromwich albion brighton fa cup fourth round replay match report","story":"Glenn Murray scored twice in extra time to ensure this tie reached a conclusion and book a fifth-round meeting with Derby but more will surely be heard about uglier events that happened on and off the pitch.The Brighton striker Florin Andone could be called by the Football Association to explain an off-the-ball incident in the first half in which he appeared to drive an elbow into the face of West Brom’s Sam Field. Both managers said they did not see what happened.“What we heard tonight is not nice,” said Hughton. “What we have in Gaëtan is a very upright, respectable inidual. For those who make those chants that’s their inidual choice and it’s down to the authorities and governors of the game to deal with. The game in recent years has acted on such things really well. All Gaëtan wants to do is very much get on with his football. He has conducted himself impeccably.”The chants were all the more audible because the crowd was so sparse, less than 9,000 choosing to turn up to watch a replay between two weakened sides. At least those who concentrated on the game were treated to some entertainment, as it was an open affair with numerous chances. The first two fell to Rodriguez, who forced saves from Jonathan Bond.Leon Balogun then nearly opened the scoring for the visitors, only for his header to come back off the crossbar. Just before half-time Brighton’s bar was left rattling by an exquisite long-range volley by Hal Robson-Kanu.The Championship side took the lead in the 78th minute in farcical fashion. Wes Hoolahan curled a free-kick in from the left and Dan Burn looped a defensive header towards the far post, where Balogun inexplicably stood by as Kyle Bartley hooked it into the net from one yard.The lead did not last long. Four minutes later Andone pounced on a loose pass by Bartley before finishing neatly to send the tie into extra time.West Brom suffered a blow early in the additional period when Robson-Kanu limped off to leave them with 10 men, Darren Moore having made all his substitutions.Hughton introduced Murray from the bench and the 35-year-old scored within two minutes, on hand to nudge the ball over the line from close range after a low cross by Jürgen Locadia.Murray completed the scoring with a crisp finish after being set up by Davy Pröpper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513bb2068483a102387a45465a28272167007ea9/0_99_2991_1794/master/2991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e69d83e9d73cda092f546319b18929a","title":"bbc radio 4 sheds 750000 listeners in year rajar figures commercial rivals","story":"Flagship news and current affairs station’s Rajar figures hit hard by commercial rivalsBBC Radio 4 has lost three-quarters of a million listeners in the last year, according to official figures that show the challenge facing the corporation’s speech radio stations from commercial rivals.At the same time, the commercial talk radio station LBC achieved its highest audience in its 46-year history, reaching 2.2 million listeners a week as they tuned in to more opinionated programming from the likes of Nick Ferrari, James O’Brien and Nigel Farage.The official Rajar figures show the challenges the BBC is up against at a time when commercial rivals are paying big money to lure away its stars. The UK’s three major commercial radio networks are investing heavily in new, digital-only outlets in the belief that the proliferation of digital radios and smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echowill encourage people to try new stations.The BBC’s director of radio, James Purnell, has previously said he was not concerned with such metrics and was instead focusing on developing the audience for the much-criticised BBC Sounds app and ensuring its output was relevant to the next generation through increased investment in podcasting and online audio.The period covered by the Rajar figures was shortly before a substantial changeover in the world of radio that saw several high-profile presenters switch stations including Chris Evans to Virgin Radio, Zoe Ball and Sara Cox starting new shows on BBC Radio 2 and Simon Mayo leaving to start a new classical music station.BBC Radio 1 also lost half a million listeners, though the new Greg James breakfast show added 300,000 people to its audience when listeners aged 10 and over were included.Radio 4’s Today programme is now listened to by 6.8 million listeners a week, only a slight dip on the same period last year. On Wednesday John Humphrys confirmed he would be leaving the station after 32 years with the programme.Elsewhere in the commercial radio sector Bauer Media’s Magic network has hit a record high of 4.2 million listeners, while Global’s Heart network is reaching 9.7 million listeners a week.Rupert Murdoch’s Wireless Group, the third-biggest UK commercial radio group, has made a substantial investment in the likes of Virgin Radio and TalkRadio, but listener figures suggest it is still struggling to build an audience.Despite outbidding the BBC for sports rights and hiring Jeremy Kyle, Matthew Wright and Eamonn Holmes, the audience for its national stations has only edged up slightly from a low base and it remains a comparative minnow in the industry.Virgin Radio only attracted 447,000 listeners a week at the end of 2018, a far cry from the 9 million who tuned in to the final months of Evans’s BBC Radio 2 breakfast show. His bosses will be hoping this figure jumps substantially in the coming months, aided by his high-profile arrival, heavy advertising and cross-promotion from the Sun newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d2ea5cf531c958f56f21104188ab4c3607c7c6f/1682_751_1590_954/master/1590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e65011cf1e82fd2f32f3ce6770c7c306","title":"salif keita interview democracy is a not a good thing for africa","story":"The ‘golden voice of Africa’ has just released his final album. And though he is visibly tired, he is still in love with his guitarSalif Keita, Mali’s most famous musical son, is going home. “I’m returning to the land,” he says. “I was a farmer’s son. I am a farmer’s son. Now, I will go back to the country and cultivate.” Cultivate what? I ask, not for the first time. Keita does not answer, not for the first time. He closes his eyes and falls silent. When he does speak, it is bursts of a few words and short, stilted answers.I am in a modest hotel suite in the north of Paris with one of the greatest musical talents the African continent has ever produced. Keita, known as the “golden voice of Africa”, has enjoyed a career ning more than half a century. Now nearly 70 years old, he is known not just for his extraordinarily powerful and passionate voice, but for the genetic condition he has called albinism that has made him, he says, “white of skin and black of blood”. He has sung for Nelson Mandela, and in aid of Ethiopia. He continues to sing to highlight the desperate plight of those with albinism across Africa, giving his time and talent to raise funds.Keita is eating breakfast, a plate of fried chicken and onions, chunks of crispy baguette and milky tea. His answers are brief and so softly-spoken it’s a struggle to catch the occasional word in between the food and the clatter of cutlery. More than once, he stops eating, looks pained, and rubs both his hands vigorously over his face.He is in Paris to promote his 14th album Un Autre Blanc (Another White), the title a reference to his struggles as a singer-songwriter with albinism. Keita says it is definitely his last. “I will do some concerts and perhaps some tours. Nothing major and not another album.” He shakes his head. “Too much work. I am going to rest.”Going “back to the country” means returning to the village of Djoliba, 23 miles south of the Malian capital Bamako, which takes its name from the local Mandingue language for the river Niger on whose banks it sits. Keita grew up here, during the last years of French colonial rule – Mali became independent in 1960 – as one of 12 children in a family directly descended from the warrior king Sundiata Keita, the 13th-century founder of the Mali empire. They were aristocratic, but dirt poor.The musician has said his father was shocked but not entirely surprised when he was born with albinism, a condition caused by the absence of melanin pigmentation in the skin. There had been others with the condition on his mother’s side of the family. “It is a problem in places where cousins marry, a problem of culture,” he explains.As a child, Keita’s family kept him out of the fields, where working under the fierce sun was out of the question, but they were unable to protect him once he started school. “There were 500 students and I was the only white. Of course, I realised I was different and they didn’t let me forget it. I was bullied. Physically. It was not easy. I learned quickly how to defend myself.”“I didn’t want to be a musician. I am from a family of nobles. In Mali, nobles don’t make music – that’s for the griots,” he continues, referring to West African troubadour storytellers. “But I had no choice. I could be a musician or I could be a delinquent, a criminal, a thief, a bandit.”I am curious as to why these were the only options. “I am an albino. What else could I do? There was nothing else. My family didn’t want me to be a musician. They tried to stop me. So I left,” he says.Keita went to Bamako, and began singing in cafes and restaurants. He taught himself to play guitar, first joining the Rail Band, entertaining guests in the hotel restaurant at the railway station, then the Ambassadors, who were based at a hotel with an international clientele.“I decided to learn the guitar and do some music. It was just something to do while waiting to find another job. I didn’t think I would be a professional musician but in the end I never had another career. It was a surprise to be so successful.” Success also brought reconciliation with his family. “Later, when they saw that I was famous, they accepted it more.”In the 1980s, Keita moved to Paris where he released his first album Soro, and in 1988 he was invited to join the anti-apartheid Nelson Mandela 70th birthday tribute at Wembley stadium, an event relayed to 67 countries with an audience of 600 million. London does not appear to have made a huge impression on the singer, then or since. “It’s always raining.”As he travelled, he picked up different musical influences including Cuban salsa and European bands like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, taking “bits and pieces here and there” and creating the afro-pop sound he is credited with founding. “But I never wanted to go far from my traditions. There is a melody, a heart, to Malian music that’s almost oriental,” he says.He becomes more animated when asked whether he will use his retirement to become more involved in politics. Mali, one of the world’s poorest nations, has been in turmoil since Tuareg rebels and loosely allied Islamists took over its north in 2012 and sparked the overthrow of the president. French forces intervened to push them back the following year but Islamists have since regained a foothold in the north and centre, exploiting ethnic rivalries to recruit new members.“It’s hard to be a good person when you are corrupt, and our politicians are always corrupt,” Keita says. “Mali is the most corrupt country in the world after Cameroon.Close to his heart is an ongoing campaign to raise awareness of albinism and help sufferers. Across the continent, folklore and superstitions mean sufferers are shunned or worse, beaten, killed and dismembered for their body parts credited with magical powers.Last November, Keita organised a benefit concert to raise awareness of the problem after a five-year-old girl with albinism, Ramata Diarra, was ritually killed and beheaded in the town of Fama, 80 miles west of Bamako. “Never again,” he said at the event. “I have the strong hope that people will understand that we are born in the same way and we have the same rights as everyone else.”He now oversees two foundations – Salif Keita Mali and the Salif Keita Global Foundation, based in the US – to continue this campaign. As well as combating prejudice, it offers practical help for sufferers, distributing suncreams to lessen the risk of skin cancers, and spectacles.“We have to speak out. People with albinism are killed because of old beliefs that say their limbs have powers. This kind of belief is not finished in Africa,” Keita says. “It is true that people who are different are badly treated all around the world. It is different for me now – people hardly notice I am an albino. If you are famous, you pass unnoticed. But this work is a duty, a duty to give something back. If I am popular, I must serve others and this is how I do it. What I am saying is that the colour of your skin is not a handicap … and it’s not very important either.”It is the most he has said in one go in the last hour, but now our time is up. Keita has a busy schedule of interviews before he returns to Africa with his “wife”. I am about to ask when he nods to two black guitar cases propped against the wall.“My guitar is my wife. A good wife. If I leave her there she is still there and still the same when I come back to her. We will always be together … but now I’m going back for a rest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

He added: “Following last week’s rejection by the House of Commons of no deal, all necessary steps must be taken to avoid such an outcome.”He concluded: “My colleagues and I look forward to discussing these proposals with you further, in the constructive manner in which they are intended, with the aim of securing a sensible agreement that can win the support of parliament and bring the country together.”May has so far vehemently resisted the prospect of reopening the political declaration, focusing instead on securing changes to the Irish backstop, which has been the flashpoint for Brexiter Conservative MPs.But at the same time, her government has been trying to win over Labour backbenchers with new legally binding promises on workers’ rights.She could propose a new draft bill as early as next week guaranteeing that UK workers’ rights will keep pace with Europe.Backbench Labour sources said the new bill was in the late stages of drafting and would include a “regression lock” that the UK parliament would ensure workers’ rights would never slip below European standards. That approach appears likely to come close to meeting one of Corbyn’s five tests.Multiple Labour MPs who have met May over the past few months have made it clear to her that they needed the guarantees to be made in primary legislation – because they do not trust that May will remain in No 10 for much longer.Those who are in negotiations with the government have insisted that the bill must be tabled and have had at least one day of second reading within the next few months.The Labour MP John Mann, one of the key figures behind the push for legislation, said: “There needs to be a bill produced soon. We aren’t basing anything on a promise, with all due respect to the prime minister. We are doing it based on statute.”The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who has also intimated she could back May’s deal, said the right offer from No 10 could win over up to 60 Labour MPs.But Phil Wilson, the Labour MP for Sedgefield and a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “It was perhaps inevitable that at some point my party would publish something like this even though most Labour MPs, members and voters have long since worked out that there is no form of Brexit that can meet the promises made in 2016 or do anything but make people poorer … In the end there is only one way out of this mess for both our country and the Labour party – a people’s vote.”Trade unions are understood to have been pushing for the legislation to include an easing of restrictions on union activity. Union leaders had been seeking more concrete proposals for regulation of the labour market after Brexit and the enforcement of existing law.“Their desire to bring in seasonal agricultural workers from around the globe, as well as barista visas, really does ring alarm bells,” one union source said. “Our fear is that when workers depend on their bosses for their visas, exploitation is sure to follow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4853d5e87c6fe742137ee0a503a3498cf1de8e53/0_190_3639_2183/master/3639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b0ee1bb32968bb737afafd08adb5c00","title":"england squad six nations france cokanasiga shields cole moon","story":"• Cole and Moon expected to be involved in England’s front row• Joe Cokanasiga and Brad Shields vying for Twickenham actionEngland have kept France guessing by naming Joe Cokanasiga, Brad Shields, Dan Cole and Ben Moon in a 25-man squad for Sunday’s Six Nations game at Twickenham. The quartet replace Mike Brown, Harry Williams, Ellis Genge and the injured Maro Itoje, with the fit-again centre Ben Te’o also surplus to requirements.The recalled Cole and Moon look set to be involved in England’s front-row plans, with Cokanasiga and Shields potentially vying with Chris Ashton and Nathan Hughes for spots in Eddie Jones’s matchday squad. Cokanasiga’s knee was heavily strapped in training at Bagshot, while Shields is only just back from a side strain that ruled him out of contention against Ireland.Te’o, who had been earmarked for a role in Dublin, will have to be patient, with Manu Tuilagi having made an instant impact on his starting return to England’s midfield. With competition for places intensifying, the more experienced Cole and the set-piece specialist Moon have been preferred to Williams and Genge for the encounter with France.England are determined not to be bullied by a huge French pack and believe they can make more of an impact with their set-pieces than they did against Ireland. “We’re not afraid of the confrontation that’s going to come at scrum-time,” said the hooker Jamie George. “We’re relishing that opportunity.”“We were pretty good in Dublin but we know we can take it to a different place in terms of the way we scrum. I’ve played France a few times and they’re always a big, well-drilled pack. Weight is an advantage but there are ways around it. We want to take France to a place where it’s going be tough.”George believes England are responding well to their new defence coach, John Mitchell, for whom this week has already been a memorable one. His son Daryl made his international cricket debut for New Zealand, taking the final wicket in their T20 victory over Indiaon Wednesday.But the former All Blacks coach’s paternal pride – “Just seeing the helmet on his head with the fern on it … it has been seven years of work for the young fella” – will not distract Mitchell from his day job. “France are different opposition with different threats and they may arrive with surprise threats as well,” he said. “We’ve got to make sure we’re ready for that. If we get seduced into their type of game they will thrive. We have to be very disciplined, patient and resilient. We mustn’t get bored.”Mitchell sounds more than open to the idea of remaining beyond the World Cup, describing it as “a nice thing to think about”, and the camp is as upbeat as it has been in a while.Slade also believes England’s display in Dublin owed something to some old-school team bonding during a night out in London. “We had a room, played some darts, enjoyed a couple of drinks and had a real good time,” the centre said.“We do a very similar thing at Exeter at the start of pre-season and it’s a great way to get to know each other. You feel closer to the bloke next to you, because you’ve shared experiences off the field. It’s not purely business and work, you’re playing with your mates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93fc98c87e52e27abd37aa290d650bb4a007a34/0_143_3439_2064/master/3439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f4dbab317c61a9369b490b6fdd5e30","title":"johanna konta katie boulter gb great britain fed cup slovenia","story":"• Boulter beats Slovenia youngster Kaja Juvan 6-4, 6-2 • Konta survives scare to defeat Dalila Jakupovic 7-6 (7), 6-2The path to promotion for Great Britain in the Fed Cup was never likely to be easy, even with a home crowd to call on. Johanna Konta and Katie Boulter got the ball rolling with hard-fought wins on Wednesday night as they beat Slovenia, but with Greece awaiting on Thursday, the hard work is only just beginning.Konta showed encouraging form and timely resilience to get the better of Dalila Jakupovic, the world No 86, 7-6 (7), 6-2, saving three set points in the opening set tie-break before easing away in the second. Boulter, on her Fed Cup singles debut, had already given Britain a 1-0 lead, overcoming a nervy start to beat Kaja Juvan, an 18-year-old ranked No 169, before Konta sealed the win. Britain’s doubles went onto complete a 3-0 win.It will take four wins in four days if Britain are to give themselves a chance to escape Group One, the third tier of the competition. In the past six years, Britain have made it to the World Group II play-off only to fall agonisingly at the final hurdle. Greece are likely to present a tough challenge, especially for Britain’s No 1 Konta, who will face Maria Sakkari.At No 38, Sakkari is the second-highest ranked player on show here this week, behind Croatia’s Donna Vekic, the world No 25, and Konta knows she will need to be on top form if she is to hold up her end. Although Greece’s 2-1 loss to Hungary on Wednesday may take some of the pressure off.With the 22-year-old Boulter, now ranked 83, looking assured on her debut in the No 2 singles spot, Konta has support in the ranks but with two more group matches to come on Thursday and Friday , and potentially a fourth on Saturday, conserving energy in the early days is crucial.“I didn’t really want to be sitting there in a deciding doubles on day one,” Britain’s captain, Anne Keothavong, said, “but this competition is far from completed and it’s important that they rest, recover and get ready for tomorrow.“Physically it’s tough. Mentally I don’t think you can underestimate all the emotions they go through in the build up to this, playing in front of a home crowd for the first time. It’s completely different to what they experience in the grass court season and the format of this competition is something that shouldn’t be underestimated.”Keothavong was impressed by Boulter, who showed why she is tipped to go much higher in the rankings with a confident showing, dominating with her forehand. At 22, she is in the early stages of her career and it’s rare for her to be the more experienced player on court. But with the 1,800 tickets sold out, the crowd backed her up and helped her get through. “I didn’t know exactly how it would be but being here was quite tremendous,” Boulter said. “Everyone showed so much support and I loved it out there.”Konta, who has dropped down the rankings from inside the top 10 at the start of 2018 to a mark of 39, led 4-2 but was pegged back by Jakupovic, who returned superbly. The 27-year-old continued to take the match to Konta but, having twice given herself the chance to serve out the first set, she could not close it out as Konta held firm.In the tie-break, Jakupovic led 6-3 but in adversity, Konta dug deep, saving all three set points with aggressive play and then, after missing her first set point, she crunched a forehand onto the baseline to take the tie-break 9-7. That eased the nerves and an early break put her in charge in the second. Leading 4-1, she let slip one break but broke again in the next game and served out to wrap up the win.Heather Watson, who missed the Slovenia match because of illness, is unlikely to recover in time to play a part against Greece, placing even more emphasis on the two singles players. Konta beat Sakkari in round two on her way to the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2017 but she knows the Greek is likely to present a bigger challenge this time round.“She has been playing great tennis, especially the last 12 months,” Konta said. “I have a lot of respect for her on and off the court. She is fundamentally a great person and a great player. I am looking forward to playing her.“The last time we played was in Wimbledon in 2017. A lot has happened since then. It is another opportunity for me to play a great player.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f601f3865a5dfcbb6b31e74085fba43b977686ee/0_354_4674_2805/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a3cdf5d9f05bfd62e231ce537f8f39","title":"gerry cranham simply the best in pictures","story":"Over the course of a career which ned half a century, photographer Gerry Cranham led the field of sports photography, defining how we understand this genre today.

Up to now disability has been greatly underrepresented.”Following a campaign by a girls’ rights charity to introduce a period-themed emoji, a new ‘drop of blood’ icon is also being introduced.“The inclusion of an emoji which can express what 800 million women around the world are experiencing every month is a huge step towards normalising periods and smashing the stigma which surrounds them,” said Lucy Russell, the head of girls’ rights and youth at Plan International UK. “An emoji isn’t going to solve this, but it can help change the conversation. Ending the shame around periods begins with talking about it.”Spanning a number of other items that were previously omitted, the 59 newly approved images are expected to be released in the second half of 2019.The perceived ambiguity of one of the new emojis sparked a debate on social media. It is believed that a pinching hand gesture reported to indicate a person’s penis size could be useful for rebuffing “unsolicited dick pics”.Yawning faces, raccoons, a pot containing the South American drink maté, and waffles were among other new emojis that are potentially less open to interpretation.Last year, the highly anticipated addition of emojis depicting cartoon people with ginger hair dominated the headlines, following the annual series of additions from the Unicode Consortium, the body which maintains and regulates the library of characters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb2dd3953ae0dfe85bfb729ce8e2afc80bb17ca5/0_1_5354_3211/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7d36dfdd5ee885101b6eca900d5ea39","title":"jennifer aniston cried lap inside story friends","story":"Friends is the world’s most streamed show – 25 years after it first began. We know what happened to the stars, but what about Fun Bobby, Jack Geller and the other characters?In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors – Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox – gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman.Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year’s Day 2018, it became the most-streamed show on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK’s five- to 16-year-olds.The show’s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time.But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the “Which friend are you?” quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: “We were on a break!” – and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed – Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up.May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California. In it, five friends – Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Monica’s brother, Ross – are hanging out at their favourite coffee house when Rachel Green runs in. Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay. By the end of the episode, Rachel has moved in with Monica and started working at the coffee house.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber, Rachel’s orthodontist ex-fiance): It sounds a little egomaniacal to say that I’m the reason the show exists. But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross’s and Monica’s mother): I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn’t know that the show would be. I’ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn’t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: “We have to make this happen.”Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica’s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two): I was so young and full of myself, and I’d just done a pilot for Fox’s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: “Hey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?” It was a really small part, so, of course, I’m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: “Great!”Directing the pilot is James Burrows, co-creator of Cheers.Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica’s father): I wanted to work for Jim. I’d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: “No, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.” But I wanted to work and meet new people.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them.Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler. I went back multiple times, and then they realised Ross was the role for me. I got down to the very end, and was testing for the show. At the last minute, they said: “We’re bringing in one more guy to read.” That guy turned out to be David Schwimmer.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger, the building superintendent): I knew Matt Perry socially a bit, years before. When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we’d chat. He was a really precocious kid – but very interesting. He’d done lots of pilots already, and was on the cusp of becoming a star.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo, Rachel’s Italian boyfriend in season one): They were all very normal. All of them had a great human side. They were very humble – and really trained. They’d spent years trying to get the right jobs.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): At the beginning of Friends, Matt LeBlanc was anxious. Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: “Am I doing this right?” He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): Those kids were just ready to pop they were all good enough to have their own shows. And the casting people somehow put them together at the time, and they were all just ready to have something wonderful happen – and it did.After the pilot is taped, NBC orders a further 12 episodes.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): When I taped my first episode, no one had seen it on TV yet. While we were filming, they announced the show had been commissioned for 12 episodes. Jennifer Aniston basically cried in my lap because nothing like that had ever happened to her before.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles, Monica and Rachel’s irritable downstairs neighbour): I was there before it all started. I got there early and was watching rehearsals, and the show hadn’t been on the air yet, but I remember thinking: “These young actors are really talented.”Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): There was this excitement. There was no ego on set. People had a sense of how good the project was.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): My son was born on 10 September 1994. The next day, my agent called and said: “Friends has come back around again they’ve let go of Anita Barone and would like you to take over the part tomorrow.” I said: “Wow, I’m kind of sore! I don’t think so.” But my agent said: “Jane, this is a huge offer. They’ve said they’ll go easy on you, and you can bring your nanny.” I said: “I don’t have a nanny! I’ve got my mom.” “So bring your mom!” So I sat down and nursed my son, and watched the pilot episode. And the moment I saw David Schwimmer do the longest take ever, I was hooked. I knew I had to work with him.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was starstruck by David Schwimmer. Of course, the girls were incredible and you sort of fell in love with them. But David was the one I desperately wanted to like me and he was the one most not interested in meeting anyone.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Towards the end of the first season, I started getting people saying: “Oh, you’re that jerk on Friends.” That’s when I thought: “This thing is definitely starting to take off.”Friends airs on 22 September 1994. The initial critical response is lukewarm, but viewers like the show, and ratings are solid. By the end of the 1994-1995 season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): I went home, and the show didn’t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): They weren’t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn’t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them – May 1995.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): In season two, there was a change in everything. You’d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they’d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): Because I was part of the early days, they weren’t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn’t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): You know, someone’s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you’re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn’t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn’t change. Not with me.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren’t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they were the Beatles.By season three, the cast have made the decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show’s entire run.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel’s mother): It’s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I was on the lot this one time. I’d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they’re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): They were a united group. They would watch each other’s work. If someone had a scene they weren’t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It’s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set.Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler’s girlfriend in season four): They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn’t work, they’d all turn on the person and be like: “You blew it, Lisa!” They would bust each other’s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they’d all pretend to fall asleep.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): You’d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn’t laugh, we’d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: “What if we tried this?” And Matt LeBlanc would say: “Yeah!” And we’d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game.Paget Brewster (Kathy): Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They’d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn’t write every show – they hired a lot of good writers – but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross’s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father): We’re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: “I can’t stop thinking about your dad.” The writers stopped and said: “After he says that, why don’t you say: ‘Whatever works for you?’” We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They’d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they’d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn’t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn’t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air.With Friends’ increased popularity comes intense media scrutiny. But on set it’s business as usual.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross’s girlfriend): I remember walking into Monica’s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it’s just a hallway back there.Paget Brewster (Kathy): I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): It’s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they’re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it’s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): I got called in to do a “chemistry read” with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking “as hot as possible”. I didn’t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear … Now that I’m older, I wouldn’t be happy getting that message.By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I’d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I’m quite content. Obviously, I didn’t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I’ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I have a little bit of regret I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a orce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn’t get a publicist, which I should have done.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it’s always good to have something that people can recognise you from.In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show’s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of ersity.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): My character wasn’t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe’s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable.Paget Brewster (Kathy): It’s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what’s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That’s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: “Oh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don’t have friends of colour.” But that’s what it was then.In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a $100m deal. Thanks to streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you’re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with “Central Perk” on it. That’s so bizarre to me. She wasn’t even alive when I worked on the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Kids come up to me and recite the script.Paget Brewster (Kathy): People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: “You’re Kathy!”Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): “Dude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I met Taylor Swift, and she said: “I know you! I’m a Friends freak! You’re Mr Geller.”Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they’re like: “Oh my God!”Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time.Paget Brewster (Kathy): A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn’t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it’s gone.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): They’re independent, their parents aren’t telling them what to do, they’re making their own decisions, they’re making their own mistakes – and they’re succeeding at it! That’s aspirational for young people to see.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): Television was a very different thing back then. I don’t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there’s too much content out there now, and too much variety.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was so young. I was 27. I don’t remember feeling young then, but now it’s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It’s a good memory, and it’s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: “Was I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that’s become such a huge influence all these years later?” It’s kind of surreal.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): When someone comes up to you and says: “Hey, you were good on Friends,” it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: “Maybe you didn’t really waste your life.”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we’re all a part of each other.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Things don’t change as much as you think they do. What’s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That’s what Friends is all about. And that’s timeless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73b8bea5617554aea0944aea0cb5f711545c8d94/0_262_2965_1778/master/2965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2675730f3b16c3deb6ad1504a8f2371","title":"spoiler alert ross and rachel date teens on why they love friends","story":"The Central Perk gang are still a hit with under 18s. Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

It follows reports that US military troops installed more horizontal layers of the wire along the downtown border fence over the weekend.The vote also comes one day after Donald Trump made his case to the American people in his State of the Union address about the need for a border wall to protect the nation, describing how he has ordered 3,750 troops to prepare for what he called a “tremendous onslaught” of migrants showing up at the US-Mexico border.US soldiers have installed concertina wire at or near several official crossings, or ports of entry. In late November, US Customs and Border Protection said the military had sent 36 miles of concertina wire for use in California, Arizona and Texas. At the start of November, soldiers in Texas installed lines of wire coils below a major bridge near McAllen at the eastern end of the border. Nogales, a city of about 20,000 people, is a fraction of the size of its twin Mexican city on the other side, also called Nogales, but its economy is largely reliant on Mexican shoppers and cross-border trade. Illegal crossings in that area have dropped steeply in the past several years.Mayor Arturo Garino told the Nogales International paper on Monday: “That wire is lethal, and I really don’t know what they’re thinking by putting it all the way down to the ground.”The proclamation the city council is scheduled to vote on says concertina wire is typically something found in battlefields, and that placing it along the entirety of the border fence is “not only irresponsible but inhuman”.In a tweet, the US representative Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat, called the additional wire a stunt by the Trump administration, which he said was “trying to create the perception of rampant lawlessness and crime”.Information released by the federal government shows the number of arrests by the border patrol is the lowest since the early 1970s, while the number of agents has more than doubled.

Start at the officeA few years ago, James Levine, a doctor of endo­crinology at the Mayo Clinic, sparked a radical change in America’s office furniture. His research had inspired a pile of viral stories cataloging the negative effects of sitting at a desk: leg muscles shut down, blood pressure increases, good cholesterol plummets, your children starve. OK, I made up that last one, but the real takeaway was no less dire. “Excessive sitting is a lethal activity,” Levine, who has studied sedentary behavior for nearly 20 years and is the most widely quoted expert on the topic, told the New York Times in 2011. And the solution – at least the one people heard – was to start standing.Cue the office makeovers. Over the next several years, workers all across America embraced stand-up desks. At Outside’s headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, our building manager furiously reconfigured work spaces. Desks were removed from their shelving brackets, raised a foot and a half, and remounted. Walking the hallways, I’d do double takes every time I realized that another editor had taken a stand against sitting. Close to half our offices were eventually con­verted. Good science had spurred a small change that was dramatically improving our health. We were literally rising from the dead!Or were we? The stand-up revolution was followed by another wave of stories reporting that being on your feet in the same place all day has its own downsides, including increased risk of cardiovascular problems. What’s more, at least at Outside, few people’s habits really changed. This morning, I took a tour around our building to assess our commitment to stand-up desks. In 14 of the converted spaces, editors were either hunched over on stools or perched on chairs that they had elevated to meet the new level. They were still sitting, only higher. In a half-dozen other cases, people had simply lowered their desks back to their old positions.When I called Levine and told him what had happened at Outside, he let out the sigh of a man who’d heard all this before. “It’s not the furniture that makes the difference, it’s the behavior,” he said. “The desk without the behavior doesn’t help you.”In other words, we missed the larger point that Levine and his colleagues were trying to convey. The solution to sitting isn’t to stand, though it helps. In fact, according to the findings of a 2015 consensus panel on the topic, we need to be on our feet two to four hours while at work. But the real solution is to move. All day. The stillness is what’s killing us. We should be pacing the hallways and climbing stairs and squatting and lunging and stretching.Now that requires a radical change, one exponentially more difficult than putting your desk on stilts. But aiming for more movement might also be the most important habit you adopt from an issue of Outside packed with 72 pages of fitness advice. This is especially true if, like me, you exercise vigorously each day and therefore consider yourself healthy. Researchers have shattered that idea. I might run for an hour every weekday morning, but studies show that if I then go to work and sit at my desk for epic stretches, which I do, I am no more immune to the side-effects of sedentary living than the prototypical couch potato.When I accepted this scary conclusion, I realized how difficult moving really is. I’m not like my ancestors who worked on a farm where motion was an all-day requirement. My job seems specifically designed to keep me wasting away in a chair. A phone and a computer allow me to communicate and conduct business with nearly any writer on earth without leaving a two-foot radius.Still, I was determined to be the guy who changed his behavior. (Writing this article was a great motivator.) It didn’t go so well at first. I arrived at work determined to move more, but once I sat at my desk, old habits glued me to the computer and I forgot all about my intentions. So I placed a sticky note on my office door that said FARTHER, a little prompt reminding me to use the facility most distant from me every time I needed a drink of water or bathroom break. I also connected my computer to the printer downstairs and across the building. And rather than sending ­emails or using the phone, I tried to go directly to colleagues’ offices.Once I had those tricks nailed, I got some digital help. There are dozens of fitness wearables that can remind you to move, from the basic step counter to the fully loaded Apple Watch. Instead, I went with a free phone app called Move. It buzzes every 45 minutes and assigns me a random exercise: say, 20 body-weight squats or 15 push-ups. These alerts initially drove me crazy. (Again?!) And their commands can be cloyingly phrased: “It’s time to move it, move it.” But eventually I welcomed the interruptions. I noticed that I felt refreshed when I returned to my desk, like I’d rebooted my clogged circuitry.And the embarrassment? I haven’t exactly been a bold office revolutionary. Instead, I’ve meekly learned to be a stealth mover. Now I either find ways to look like I’m doing something perfectly normal or I make sure I don’t get caught. I do push-ups with an ear cocked toward the door, listening for approaching footsteps. I do wall sits in a corner that no one can see from the hallway. While I’m on the phone, I pace as if I’m carefully deliberating vital magazine business. At my desk, I do inconspicuous yoga poses with names like seated eagle and hip opener. I do laps around the building carrying papers to look as if I’m going somewhere, when all I’m really doing is walking in a large, 223-step circle back to my office. (If you want the full log from a recent day, see “Self Pro Motion”, below.)Am I happier? Less stressed? More productive? Any con­clu­sions I draw from my exper­iment would be based on anec­dotal evidence, the enemy of real research. But here’s what’s certain: if I continue to squeeze in an extra hour or two of movement each day, I’ll be significantly healthier in the long run. That’s the takeaway Levine and his colleagues need us to hear.If you want to dedicate yourself to a lifetime of good habits, don’t start at the gym.

I repeat. The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” he wrote.“This new provocation is not acceptable between neighbouring countries and partners in the European Union,” a French foreign ministry spokesman responded in a daily online briefing.“Mr Di Maio, who holds government responsibilities, must take care not to undermine, through his repeated interferences, our bilateral relations, in the interest of both France and Italy.”Di Maio had previously expressed his admiration for the gilets jaunes, who have been holding at times violent anti-government protests each week across France for the past few months. He urged the movement not to “give up” and said the demonstrations reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the M5S in 2009.On Tuesday he said the two groups shared “many common positions and values that focus on the battles for citizens, social rights, direct democracy and the environment”.Chalençon said while both sides “practically agree on everything”, there was no talk yet about whether they would form an alliance for the elections to the European parliament. Italian media reported that Ingrid Levavasseur, who heads the gilets jaunes’ list of 10 candidates for the elections, would meet M5S officials again in Rome next week.The meeting follows a series of verbal attacks from Di Maio and his co-deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, on the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent weeks and is also seen as an additional tactic by M5S to regain some of the popularity lost to Salvini’s far-right League since the coalition government came to power last June.“M5S is weak right now,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “They are losing traction in their traditionally antagonistic contingencies and they need to find every antagonistic issue to demonstrate that they are strong. Macron is also the perfect target for populist movements.”Panarari said the meeting with the gilets jaunes was also a way to tell Italian voters that M5S still had its “anti-establishment soul”, as well as to attract similar groups with whom they might be able to build a coalition after the EU elections.M5S launched its European election campaign in January, with Di Maio and Di Battista travelling to the European parliament in Strasbourg and denouncing the institution as a “waste of money”. At the time, Di Maio said he was preparing an election manifesto with other European populist groups.Opinion polls in France have suggested that the main impact of one or more gilets jaunes parties running in the European elections would be to reduce support for the far-right party of Marine Le Pen and the far left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.“A gilets jaunes party would likely mobilise people who do not usually vote, but also take votes from the National Rally and France Unbowed,” Emmanuel Rivière of he pollsters Kantar Public France told Le Monde. “Paradoxically, the principal beneficiary would be the party of the president.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73d5cf89660c2a844e4fab5edb26be62a12ecece/0_139_3102_1861/master/3102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f3e2beb90ff1c2f22ef6fa5c1ee886","title":"taliban say they have no plans to seize afghanistan by force","story":"Insurgents attend Moscow peace summit, but Afghan president is excludedThe Taliban and top Afghan powerbrokers have ended two days of landmark talks in Moscow with a broad but vague statement of shared principles, whose content was perhaps less important than the fact of the meeting itself.As the departure of US troops draws nearer, the insurgents have refused to meet the Afghan government, which they denounce as a puppet regime.But in Moscow they talked, ate and prayed with the powerful men who have fought against them on the battlefield, served in past governments and aspire to rule in Kabul again.The delegation from Kabul included a former president, Hamid Karzai, an aspiring one, Hanif Atmar, and only two women. It was the closest the Taliban had come to acknowledging that swathes of the population opposed to their rule will also need representatives at the table for any peace talks. Karzai said a nine-point agreement that was adopted late on Wednesday at Moscow’s President hotel included calls for “peace, stability and an Afghanistan free of foreign forces”.The Taliban’s lead negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, in a statement to the press, described the meeting as “very successful – we managed to agree on a lot of points”.The Afghan government did not attend the talks and Wednesday’s vague agreement glossed over most thorny details, including any possible timetable for a western withdrawal from the country.In remarks to journalists, Stanikzai denied previous statements byTaliban negotiators that the US had agreed to withdraw half of its troops from Afghanistan by the end of April, saying that no deadline had been agreed and talks were continuing.He had also told the BBC on Tuesday that the Taliban had no plans to seize the whole of Afghanistan by military force, and saying a push for total military domination “will not bring peace to Afghanistan”.The Moscow meeting came as Donald Trump signalled an increased determination to end the US military presence there after more than 17 years. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” he said in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.He has appointed a senior envoy to push for a negotiated end to the war, and US and Taliban negotiators spent six days last month hammering out a framework draft of a peace deal in Qatar.In Moscow some of the pro-government delegates warned that the US should not leave too fast. “We know that President Trump is in a hurry about this peace process,” said Atta Muhammad Noor, one of the most influential men in northern Afghanistan.“Anything which is done in a hurry can lead to some damage. We have to be very careful,” he said, calling for any withdrawal to take place only after Afghanistan’s security had been guaranteed.The latest rounds of talks have left the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, uncomfortably isolated.But seated around the table in Moscow were some of Afghanistan’s most wealthy and influential men, warlords and others who wielded power in civilian governments. Several had formed part of Ghani’s government until recently.Ghani denounced his exclusion in an angry interview on Afghanistan’s Tolo TV channel. “At the end of any peace deal, the decision-maker will be the government of Afghanistan,” he said. “Rest assured that no one can push us aside.”Karzai, who led the delegation, shrugged off charges of hypocrisy during his terms as president he denounced any efforts to talk to the Taliban that excluded his own government.The talks saw hundreds of Afghan representatives, veterans of wars for and against both the US and the Soviets, and rounds of civil war, descend on the marble lobby of Moscow’s President hotel. The negotiations took place in a grand conference room flanked by souvenir shops, with occasional breaks for prayer.Anwar ul-Haq Ahady, a former finance minister, said in an interview that the conference’s location showed that Russia was once again becoming “relevant” in Afghanistan.“In the past few years, Russia has reasserted its role” in Afghanistan, said Ahady. “It has relations with the Taliban and some of the leading personalities of Afghanistan. I think it’s a sign of the re-emergence of Russia in Afghan politics.”The Moscow talks are officially being organised by members of the Afghan diaspora. But there is little question of official support, not least because the Taliban delegation given visas to travel are all still on a terror watchlist. The meeting was also held at a Kremlin-owned hotel.Women’s rights have played a prominent role in the talks, with concerns that an empowered Taliban could seek to roll back new civil rights if they gain great power. The two women delegates called for women’s rights to be at the heart of any settlement, and protected by the international community.The Taliban at the talks have disavowed responsibility for some of the most heinous acts of violence against women in areas controlled by the group, and have said they will grant all women their rights under Islamic law.But Fawzia Koofi, a politician and women’s rights activist, said Afghan women wanted a mechanism to enforce any promises. “How do you ensure that all these nice statements are not just made to convince the US and international community to leave and then life goes back to how it was under the Taliban?” she asked.“We have to be very careful with these nice statements. If there’s no guarantor, how can we ensure that things won’t return to how they were under the Taliban?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3184486453202a4724643187ef6478676f258b5e/0_204_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ab2742110cda0eb717fe8001ce187e","title":"venezuela faes special forces nicolas maduro barrios","story":"Activists suspect Nicolás Maduro has tasked Faes with pacifying the city’s barrios in bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of ChavismoA flickering candle and 19 rose petals – one for every year he lived – adorn a shrine in what used to be the home of Alixon Pisani.“We love you,” reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen.It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicolás Maduro’s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas.“He was still just a boy,” said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani.“They are murderers … demons,” she said of her nephew’s killers. “He just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?”Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.Hugo Chávez first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor.In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,” Chávez said.In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you not go out to protest?”Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described a series of war-like operations in the days after opposition leader Juan Guaidó sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with Nicolás Maduro,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the barrio goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.“Chávez would go into the barrios, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my presidente,’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him. They loved him.”And what if Maduro came calling today?“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it. In a recent report, the Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Faes was created by Maduro in 2017 to fight “organized crime and terrorism” and was part of Venezuela’s national police force, although some stories in state-run media outlets describe it as being under the command of the Venezuelan military. By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.In a recent post on its Instagram account the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.In one Instagram video, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.Asked about alleged Faes killings on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “inidual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.“Why did they kill him? What for?” she asked. “His life had hardly even begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd72c6306c06ea2c8bb1fd0062eb1e139eadba2/0_8_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb7f89a10cf85b02c045aec5ff303f1","title":"venezuelan troops blockade bridge to stop aid from colombia","story":"Opposition uses humanitarian shipment to test army’s loyalty but government sees it as prelude to military interventionVenezuelan troops have barricaded a bridge on the country’s western border with Colombia in an apparent attempt to prevent the entry of humanitarian aid sent by opposition leaders trying to force Nicolás Maduro from power.On Wednesday at lunchtime, a fuel tanker and two shipping containers blocked the Tienditas international bridge, which connects the two countries and has become a staging ground for the planned relief effort. Members of Venezuela’s Bolivarian national guard could also be seen at the bridge.A convoy carrying the aid, which was donated by the US, left Bogotá at 11am on Wednesday and was making its way along winding mountain rounds to Cúcuta, a Colombian government official said. The earliest it will reach the border is Thursday morning.Maduro has repeatedly denied his economically devastated country is facing a humanitarian crisis, apparently fearing such an acceptance could be used to justify foreign military intervention. “We are not beggars,” he said in a speech to troops this week.The attempt by his political rival, Juan Guaidó, to push aid in through Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil represents the latest attempt to weaken Maduro’s embattled regime by forcing members of the military to disobey his orders and allow the aid to pass.“The main goal now is to look to break the military – and the humanitarian aid is basically the Trojan horse to try to do that,” said Maryhen Jiménez Morales, an Oxford University specialist in Venezuelan politics.Guaidó urged Venezuela’s border troops not to stand in the way of humanitarian aid that was intended to help “your family, your sister, your mum, your wife – who surely need these supplies”.Juan Andrés Mejía, a lawmaker from Guaidó’s party, Voluntad Popular (People’s Will), told the  that trying to deliver aid across Venezuela’s borders was a double challenge to Maduro’s regime – as well as an effort to alleviate a humanitarian crisis that has seen millions of Venezuelans flee abroad.Mejía added: “We are a non-violent movement. We do not have weapons and we do not want to have them. We are absolutely certain that violence benefits the government and we cannot win a violent struggle against the government.”The United Nations warned against using aid as a political tool. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” said a spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. “When we see the present standoff it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.”A congressman from Cúcuta, Juan Capacho, told the  the blockade was a “tyrannical irresponsibility that we will get over”, and that the aid would “help give Venezuela liberty”.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, tweeted: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The U.S. \u0026amp other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”However, Maduro and members of his inner circle have remained publicly adamant that the aid will not be allowed in.“With this show of humanitarian aid they are trying to send a message: ‘Venezuela has to go begging to the world!’ And Venezuela will not beg for anything from anyone in this world,” Maduro said on Monday.On Tuesday, Diosdado Cabello, another top Chavista, depicted the aid effort as part of a hostile foreign military intervention that would be rebuffed.“Our territory must be respected. As our brother President Nicolás Maduro has said: any military unit that tries to penetrate our territory will be repelled and our Bolivarian national armed forces will defend our territory. There should be no doubt about it.”Additional reporting by Patricia Torres"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d0ad69db4663d7464b60af510d3eceb5d676f0/0_251_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea93f57f25a4feeaaaeb4c0c0f934ef2","title":"we are hero thai election hopefuls give themselves a hollywood makeover","story":"Thai Local Power party goes the full blockbuster to get candidates ahead of the other 107 registered partiesAfter years of military rule in Thailand and multiple postponed elections, politicians seem to have turned themselves into stars – or former prime ministers – in order to attract votes.With new strict campaigning laws restricting what kind of messaging candidates can send out , one political party has published somewhat unusual posters. Presenting themselves as “heroes”, the leaders of the Thai Local Power party pose in blockbuster-like settings.Under the Hashtag #WeAreHero and #SmartLocalsSmartThailand, party leader Chuenchob Kongudom, drag actor and board director member Assadayut Khunviseadpong (known as drag persona Natalia Pliacam), and actor and deputy president Rattapoom Toekongsa alias Film Rattapoom, tried to get voters’ attention, using cinematic effects ahead of elections set for 24 March.Paul Chambers, a lecturer at the College of Asean community studies at Thailand’s Naresuan University, said the move was born out of “desperation” when competing with 108 parties registered. This, he said, intended to appeal to young people “who may be apathetic to the issues of the day”.Online, some lauded what they called a “creative” approach, while others remained critical. In an online forum, user JayBird1138 appeared to take a swipe at US and Thai politics at once. “Reality TV helped one person become president,” they said. “So, this is doing it Thai style?”For Facebook user Pichet Krongkampol, politics “isn’t supposed to be some entertainment”, though he did accept it was entertaining. Kitti Ruangphunglhuang echoed similar feelings. “This is idiotic.

Photograph: PAThe Border town of Newry is being considered as a location to dispose of the United Kingdom’s nuclear waste, with research identifying the area as potentially suitable for an underground disposal facility.It is one of five sites in Northern Ireland under consideration as possible stores for the waste and among 45 being examined across the UK as whole.An area of granite bedrock near Newry may be suitable for a geological disposal facility (GDF), according to a recent preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management (RWM), a UK State-owned company.The area of rock stretches from Slieve Gullion to the Mourne mountains. Geological disposal sites hold radioactive waste hundreds of metres underground, and there are no current facilities in Northern Ireland.Future policy decisions on nuclear disposal in Northern Ireland rest with the Stormont executive, where power-sharing has been collapsed for more than two years. The British government’s current preference is that one facility would service the entire UK, a spokesman for RWM has said. Any future facility would need the support of the local community before it could be approved.Nuclear waste is stored at about 30 sites across Britain, but predominantly at ground level at the Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria.Granite“There are granites and similar strong rocks around Newry, in which we may be able to site a GDF,” the recent RWM report said. “We would need to do more work to find out whether these rocks have suitable properties and thicknesses in the depth range of interest for a GDF.” Preliminary reports into other regions of Northern Ireland found a section of strong rock between Omagh and Cookstown, Co Tyrone, which might support a similar facility.A number of areas in the north of the country could also possibly be suitable, researchers found. These included one location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Derry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.On Monday, an emergency motion was passed at the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, unanimously opposing locating any nuclear waste facility in the local area.Some 45 preliminary regional reports had been completed across the UK, assessing what locations might have suitable rock types to build a facility. The reports began a process that could take 10 to 15 years to identify a suitable area, gain the consent of a local community and build the facility, the RWM spokesman said. There was a “false narrative” that nuclear waste disposal facilities would be forced on communities, he said. The waste facility will contain multiple barriers to secure the radioactive material underground for hundreds of thousands of years. The British government has also promised communities hosting future facilities significant investment.Responding to the Newry report, Sinn Féin MP for South Down Chris Hazzard said Britain could not be allowed to use the North “as a dumping ground” for its hazardous and toxic waste. “Not only would this have dire consequences for our environment but it would also pose a serious health risk to the population,” he said.Fine Gael councillor for Dundalk, Co Louth, John McGahon said the initial report was likely nothing more than a “fishing expedition”.He said the probability of any plan being approved was “extremely remote”. It was important politicians on both sides of the Border were not “asleep on the issue,” but equally that local representatives did not engage in “scaremongering,” he said.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw RoundShield Partners, a €1 billion property investment house, has signed a €50 million social housing deal with debt advisory firm New Beginnings.Under the terms of the deal, which are revealed in a letter seen by The , the Irish firm will purchase, refurbish and manage residential properties for RoundShield, which has “agreed to provide up to €50 million in financing for residential acquisition”. The properties purchased by RoundShield will be let to local authorities for use as social housing under leases of 25 years. New Beginnings is led by barrister and debt advisor Ross Maguire. It is understood that the first commitment of funds could be just the beginning for the RoundShield project in Ireland, with one source saying that there were “substantially” more resources potentially available for the project.“The fund has discretionary capital significantly in excess of the requirements related to the possible acquisitions,” according to the letter. Sources with knowledge of the matter said the RoundShield fund had already begun purchasing units and was on the hunt for more deals, including potential off-market transactions. In a statement, RoundShield chief financial officer Herbert Beckman confirmed that the firm, through its Irish social housing fund, was “acquiring residential properties to support Irish local authorities in the provision of social housing”.Substantial renovationHe said the fund was “concentrating on properties that need substantial renovation, or those being sold with social tenants remaining in situ”. The fund is being administered by Davy Stockbrokers, through a Central Bank structure known as an Irish collective asset-management vehicle.New Beginnings was founded in 2010 by Mr Maguire, a senior counsel, and David Hall, the debtors’ rights campaigner. However, the pair had a falling out and have now found themselves on opposite sides of the debate about mortgage debt and the role of private-equity funds in the Irish market. Since then, the firm has expanded to include in its work a range of commercial funding products, including bridging and mezzanine loans for values above €1 million. RoundShield Partners has raised more than €1.4 billion for a variety of investment platforms, but its focus is European asset-backed “special opportunities”. The fund was established in 2013 by three former executives from capital market company ESO Capital.Sources said the deal showed that social housing was becoming an increasingly attractive asset class for overseas investors. While investing in housing for low-income people may not offer the rapid climbs in asset value provided by grade-A offices or high-end residential developments, it allows investors to tap into regular, reliable and government-backed income streams.

The Best Small Country in the World for Spending Money Like Water.The Government is still baffled about the latest overrun, although this feeling is quite normal. Not for the first time, they’ve brought in an elite invoicing body to find out why it happened. PwC is an international auditing company which provides “professional services” to organisations who want to find out if they have been behaving in an unprofessional manner. The company also specialises in the lucrative niche area of extreme-rapid builds, erecting Chinese walls in the blink of an eye.This is why the Government can award a huge building contract to a company called BAM, then call in PwC to examine how the cost of the original contract ballooned monumentally even when PwC has been supplying professional services to BAM for nearly a decade at a cost to date of €34 million.Wham, BAM and thanks for the contract, Ma’am. And if there is anything untoward in its execution or governance then PwC, behind those separating Chinese walls, will be able to pinpoint it.Government lineEoghan Murphy, who was standing in for the Taoiseach, who was busy standing beside Donald Tusk in Brussels, who was controversially standing up and goading Brexiteers, stuck by the Government line on the overrunning costs.PwC, he said, will be working “in tandem” with the Government in “getting to the root” of the hospital moneypit which nobody saw coming before they fell into it.Although, while he stressed it was a tandem effort, he meant a contraption with many saddles, pointing out that the Minister for Health was busy at Committee answering questions about the overrun that very moment, while the Minister for Finance has also answered questions on the matter, “as has the Taoiseach in the Dáil”.He forgot to mention the Minister for Social Protection, who took a spin earlier in the morning on this unique velocipede. Regina Doherty told RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke that Fine Gael is “painstakingly and excruciatingly prudent and boring when it comes to the economy”, which is why there can be no doubt that the Government’s handling of the cost overruns is beyond reproach, and aren’t they all out there answering questions?Eoghan’s “tandem” was getting very crowded. Furthermore, he told the Opposition, officials were also along for the ride. They went before committees last week where they also took questions.“A process is in place where questions about what happened are being answered but we also have to do a deeper e and PwC will do that.”It doesn’t appeared to have occurred to Eoghan and his colleagues that the controversy is not to do with them answering questions but about why they never thought about asking any when red flags about the costs were being raised as far back as early in 2017.‘Absolute disaster’People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd Barrett was concerned with the state of the health service in general, which is in “existential crisis”, but the “absolute disaster” of the children’s hospital is just “the cherry on top”.He pondered over consultants PwC’s auditing BAM’s accounts for nine years and getting paid at least €34 million for their trouble. He said the building contractor has a history of “massive overruns” and “now the people who audited them are the people who apparently are going to get to the bottom of the scandal of the national children’s hospital. It beggars belief.”Mr Murphy was anxious to stress that the Ministers didn’t know about any overruns in 2017. He was also keen to assure everybody that the Government will address these “serious issues” which people are very angry about.Paschal Donohoe repeated later on that the Cabinet is “well aware of the anger and concern” among the public over the children’s hospital, and is also aware of the “great concern” about the cost escalation. However, they have decided to move on with the project and ensure it is completed.But is he really satisfied that PwC will deliver an independent assessment?Fianna Fáil’s Billy Kelleher joined those TDs not too happy about the company’s involvement. Of all the auditing joints in all the world, it was the one the Government chose to walk into BAM.Professional jobPaschal said he is personally confident that PwC will do an independent and professional job “in relation to how this matter developed and in relation to how we can ensure that the remainder of this project is done well”.“It would want to be, for €500,000,” drawled Barry Cowen.Meanwhile, Michael Healy-Rae said what a lot of people are saying in Leinster House about the Government and the hospital overrun and how “every cloud has a silver lining” when it comes to Brexit saving the Government from a worse drubbing.“In case you think that this matter is going to go away,” Healy-Rae declared, “only for Brexit, this would bring ye down, and that’s a fact and each and every one of you know that. This is so serious.”Every TD in the country is now wondering if the knock-on effect of the inflated hospital bill will impact on local HSE budgets, he said. Which is very true – the ranks of the worried include Government backbenchers.But Paschal thinks there is enough money in the kitty to cover the massive shortfall caused by the rising bill for the new hospital. (Money which could have paid for many more much-needed projects.)“You are building it at an enormous overrun, in the wrong place ,and you’re being exposed now for making a mess of it,” was Healy-Rae’s view.This has been a very difficult week for the Taoiseach and his cabinet.On the other hand, we saw a smiling Enda Kenny in the canteen at lunchtime, full of the joys of spring and being assailed by Dáil daytrippers eager for selfies with him.Not missing government at all."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3784736.1549491322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac denies poaching headline grabbing issues from other committees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin (L) has alleged PAC had strayed outside its remit in a recent hearing on sick leave and other issues in the prison service. Photograph: Nick BradshawA powerful Dáil committee which acts as a watchdog on public spending has robustly denied it is “poaching” major headline-grabbing issues from other Oireachtas committees. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) Seán Fleming has said it does not stray outside its remit, which is to ensure that public money is not being wasted. He rejected the suggestion it was encroaching on the work of other committees. It comes as the chair of the Justice Committee submitted a formal complaint to the Ceann Comhairle about the public spending committee. Sinn Féin TD Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin has alleged Pac had strayed outside its remit in a recent hearing on sick leave and other issues in the prison service. It is understood that Independent TD Clare Daly also made a similar complaint about the Pac hearing into the prison services at the Dáil business committee, where whips decide the business of the Dáil. IncursionsThe Health Committee has also accused the Pac of incursions into its territory, when it held hearings on the cervical check scandal and, more recently, on cost overruns at the national children’s hospital. Separately, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin criticised the all-party committee for inquiring into the finances of Áras an Uachtaráin on the eve of the Presidential election campaign in October. Mr Fleming strongly dismissed any suggestion the Pac was involved in a “turf war”. He told The  the committee has always rigidly adhered to its brief.“We are very clear in the Pac that we have a duty relative to taxpayers’ money. Many departmental activities have financial dimensions and it is our duty to carry out diligence on those.”He gave the CervicalCheck scandal as an example. “We started to a look at it because of the costs of medical negligence. There was a bill of €2 billion facing the State and we needed to interrogate that,” he said.He said the Pac took great care last week to ensure that its work did not duplicate the work of the Health Committee on the hospital project. “As far as our examination of the prison service, there are 1,600 cases being taken against the State on ‘slopping out’. We have rigidly concentrated on finances in our inquiries.”Martin Fraser, the secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach, will appear before the Pac on Thursday to discuss spending in Áras an Uachtaráin. Mr Fleming said it was routine and was born of the aim to include the President’s office in its regular work schedule.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

But Mr Maduro, who has the support of the army, will not allow it to cross the border.On Wednesday, Venezuelan soldiers were using a fuel tanker and cargo containers to cut off access to the Tienditas bridge, which links the Colombian border town of Cucuta to Ureña in Venezuela.Members of Venezuela\u0027s Bolivarian national guard could also been seen at the border crossing.The Colombian Foreign Ministry says a second crossing in the northern department of La Guajira has also been blocked.A blockade at the Tienditas bridge, on the Colombian-Venezuelan borderMike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, reacted angrily to the blockade, tweeting: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The US \u0026amp other countries are trying to help, but #Venezuela’s military under Maduro\u0027s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE. #EstamosUnidosVE”John Bolton, the US national security advisor, echoed his comments, and lashed out at Mr Maduro for seeking only to look after himself.“Maduro and his cronies live lavishly in Europe and enrich their Cuban patrons while plundering Venezuela’s wealth,” he said. “Meanwhile, they are physically blocking the Venezuelan people, including the military rank and file, from receiving humanitarian assistance.”He said the US would protect any senior military official who accepts Mr Guaido’s legitimacy.“The US will consider sanctions off-ramps for any Venezuelan senior military officer that stands for democracy and recognizes the constitutional government of President Juan Guaido,” he said. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely. Make the right choice!”Mr Maduro, increasingly isolated, has sought to sell off the country’s gold reserves to keep his regime afloat. The Bank of England, which holds $1.2 billion in Venezuelan gold, has blocked him from doing so, but Mr Maduro\u0027s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led national assembly, an opposition politician said Wednesday.Nicolas Maduro, pictured inspecting troops on MondayCarlos Paparoni also said that Mr Maduro\u0027s administration had transferred 127 million euros to bank accounts in Russia, without specifying when. Since Monday, the Venezuelan government has not been able to move money between its accounts in banks in the European Union, he added.We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold, Mr Paparoni said.The FBI raided a bank in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, on suspicion of the bank breaking sanctions placed on senior members of Mr Maduro’s government.And the aid delivery represents the latest attempt by Mr Maduro\u0027s political rival, 35-year-old national assembly president Mr Guaido, to weaken the Venezuelan regime by forcing members of the military to disobey Mr Maduro\u0027s orders.Mr Guaido on Tuesday met with former cabinet members of the late Hugo Chavez to discuss the way out of the impasse. He also met with mayors of Venezuelan cities to discuss distributing the aid.Venezuelan opposition leaders, who have gathered in Cucuta, appealed to the Venezuelan military to allow safe passage for the aid trucks.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, said Miguel Pizarro, a pro-Guaido politician.Tents and other logistical supplies have begun to arrive in Cucuta, but the bulk of the 60 tons of aid remains in the Colombian capital, Bogota. Local officials suggested the arrival may be delayed until the border crossing is cleared, or until both sides have negotiated an agreement to let the aid pass.The United Nations and the Red Cross expressed alarm on Wednesday about the politicisation of aid.Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives, said Stephane Dujarric, UN spokesman, speaking in New York.When we see the present stand-off it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of Venezuela.Mr Guaido wrote to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month asking for help in tackling the country\u0027s crisis. But Venezuela\u0027s seat at the 193-member world body is held by Mr Maduro\u0027s government and Mr Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro\u0027s approval or UN Security Council authorisation – something which would be blocked by Russia and China.In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was doubling its resources to cope with the crisis, where food and medicine shortages have pushed 2.3 million people to flee since 2015.Our focus is really to, on the one side increase our response to Venezuelans, and on the other hand to keep away from the political controversy and political isions which are characteristic to the crisis in Venezuela, said Peter Maurer, ICRC chief.Juan Guaido, the man recognised by Britain, the US and dozens of other nations as the rightful interim president of VenezuelaWalter Marquez, a former member of Venezuela´s national assembly, told The  that the refusal to allow the entry of food and medicines contravenes international law.“The UN must assume its responsibility to protect the people of Venezuela,” he said. “The International Criminal Court has the power to take preventative measures and that´s what we´d like to see.”Mr Maduro has said repeatedly that the arrival of humanitarian aid would be the start of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.”Mr Marquez denied that the Venezuelan opposition hoped to provoke military intervention, but he said he was pessimistic about the chances of a peaceful solution.“I don\u0027t see how negotiations will work,” he said. “They will have to use force to get the aid in.Please review our commenting policyBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeUniversity applications up for first time in three years, fuelled by rise in international studentsLibby Squire: Campus fears grow as search for student draws blank a week on from disappearance Social media fuels \u0026#39addiction\u0026#39: Chief Medical Officer backs duty of careFive-yearly cervical cancer screening will save lives, NHS trial suggestsExplosion fears at Ocado Andover warehouse fire as company cancels orders Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of a Child, review: a sobering film about children living with domestic violence Comment: The Government will move against social media firms if they continue to fail our childrenComment: Life as a royal wife is a marathon, not a sprint.

sparking an international crisis - claims that up to 300,000 people face death if the aid is not delivered.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, lawmaker Miguel Pizarro said in a message to the military.Opposition leaders have warned the armed forces not to cross a \u0026#34red line\u0026#34 by blocking aidMaduro, though, said humanitarian aid would be the forerunner of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.Venezuelan military officers used a tanker truck and huge shipping container to block access to the Tienditas bridge, which links Cucuta, Colombia to Urena, Venezuela.Franklyn Duarte, an opposition lawmaker from the border state of Tachira, told AFP that troops from the armed forces were blocking the crossing.The aid delivery was being coordinated by Guaido, who has declared himself interim president of the oil-rich country and now enjoys the backing of some 40 countries as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate leader.Maduro, 56, has repeatedly accused the United States of fomenting a coup.The US, which has not ruled out a military intervention in crisis-wracked Venezuela, was the first to recognize him as acting president, followed by a dozen Latin American countries.In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump reaffirmed US support for Guaido, saying we stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom.Police block a at street that leads to the US embassy during a protest against US intervention in Venezuela, in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaBritain, France, Germany and Spain were among 20 EU nations to side with Guaido this week after Maduro ignored their demands that he announce new presidential elections by February 3Guaido is trying to force Maduro from power, set up a transitional government and hold a new presidential poll.He thanked his EU supporters for supporting all Venezuelans in this struggle we undertake to rescue our nation\u0027s democracy, freedom and justice.But key Maduro ally Russia slammed what it called interference in the oil-rich but now poor Latin American country, saying it was an attempt to legitimize usurped power.Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the EU of trying to topple the government by violence and ruse, while berating the US for treating Venezuela like one of your states.Venezuela\u0026#39s President Maduro speaks during a meeting with representatives of the transport sector in CaracasGuaido, 35, claims his legitimacy from the constitution and has been ramping up pressure on Maduro by calling his supporters out into the streets.The next mass demonstration is due for February 12.Guaido must still find a way to bring in the humanitarian aid given the military\u0027s loyalty to Maduro.He accused the military on Monday of planning to ert aid being stockpiled in Colombia, Brazil and an unidentified Caribbean island, in order to distribute it through the socialist government\u0027s subsidized food program for its own supporters.The National Assembly said the military must decide whether it is on the side of the people or the problem.Guaido knows he needs the armed forces on his side to dislodge Maduro. He was boosted on Saturday by the defection of a top air force general.His fledgling alternative administration will hold talks in Washington February 14 on responding to the largest hemispheric humanitarian crisis in modern history.Maduro disclosed on Monday that he sent Pope Francis a letter seeking help in mediating the country\u0027s crisis. The pope told journalists Tuesday that this would require agreement from both the government and the opposition.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader. Local NGO Foro Penal said almost 1,000 people were detained between January 21 and 31.Please review our commenting policyBody recovered from wreckage of Emiliano Sala\u0026#39s planeUniversity applications up for first time in three years, fuelled by rise in international studentsLibby Squire: Campus fears grow as search for student draws blank a week on from disappearance Social media fuels \u0026#39addiction\u0026#39: Chief Medical Officer backs duty of careFive-yearly cervical cancer screening will save lives, NHS trial suggestsExplosion fears at Ocado Andover warehouse fire as company cancels orders Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of a Child, review: a sobering film about children living with domestic violence Comment: The Government will move against social media firms if they continue to fail our childrenComment: Life as a royal wife is a marathon, not a sprint.

In 2005 he departed to vist the UK, and returned later that month.\u0026nbsp21 claims his legal status expired in 2006 through no fault of his own, and that he applied for a visa in 2017 after learning that he required one.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMr Abraham-Joseph has three US citizen children, a lawful permanent resident mother and four siblings that are either US citizens or lawful permanent residents, the statement continued. He has exceptionally strong ties in the United States, having lived here since he was in the first grade.

DHS has known his address since the filing of a US visa application in 2017. He has never hidden from DHS or any of its agencies. Mr Abraham-Joseph is not subject to mandatory detention under federal law and is eligible for bond.By statute, bond should be granted by ICE when there is no flight risk or a danger to the community... we are unaware of why ICE apparently targeted MR Abraham-Jospeh, but we will do everything possible to legally seek his release and pursue his available relief in immigration court.At the time of the arrest, ICE claimed in a statement that 21 Savage “initially entered the US\u0026nbsplegally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the US\u0026nbspwhen his visa expired in July 2006.Created with Sketch.

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The difficulty ranges from simple phrases like woman kicking the football, to more complex concepts like celebrating a festival.Crucially, the AI has never seen these phrases before and must either guess them from images drawn by the human player, or convey them to the human through its own series of images.The difficulty in teaching artificial intelligence common sense has proved to be one of the key stumbling blocks in developing chatbots and voice assistants that are genuinely multi-purpose.This is a first step toward exploiting common sense, said Aniruddha Kembhavi, a computer scientist who worked on the project.Fellow computer scientist Ali Farhadi added: We wanted to build an AI system that can collaborate with human beings, and at the same time is learning about how humans think, how they act...

It follows a pair of sisters from the vaudeville circuit who try to make it big on Broadway.490 All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)One of the most harrowing accounts of WWI, All Quiet on the Western Front was the first Best Picture winner to win Best Director too (Lewis Milestone accepted the trophy).Westerns don\u0027t usually win the main prize at the Oscars, but Cimarron proves a rare exception.Grand Hotel, starring Joan Crawford and John Barrymore, is the only Best Picture winner that received no nominations in any other category.This film presents a view of English life during the first quarter of the 20th century from New Year\u0027s Eve 1899 to New Year\u0027s Day 1933, from the point of view of well-to-do London residents Jane and Robert Marryot (Diana Wynward and Clive Brook).The first of three films to win in all the five main categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay) alongside One Flew over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest and The Silence of the Lambs.990 Mutiny on the Bounty (1935)Another win for Cavalcade director Frank Lloyd that inspired the creation of the Best Supporting Actor category after three of its lead stars – Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone – were nominated for Best Actor. Interestingly, they were all beaten by Victor McLaglen for The Informer.This lavish and extremely lengthy MGM production remains a standard in musical filmmaking, even if critics have fallen out of love with it over the years.1190 The Life of Emile Zola (1937)Paul Muni failed to win the Best Actor trophy for his portrayal of French playwright Émile Zola, but the film took home Best Picture beating out the likes of The Awful Truth and A Star Is Born.1290 You Can\u0027t Take It with You (1938)It Happened One Night filmmaker Frank Capra\u0027s third Best Director win came with his second victory in the Best Picture category. 1390 Gone with the Wind  (1939)One of the most successful films of all time, Gone with the Wind swept the board at the Oscars, winning 10 out of 13 nominations.Alfred Hitchcock\u0027s first American film, an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier\u0027s gothic drama, won Best Picture, but failed to win any awards in any of the acting, writing or director category – one of the only instances in Oscar history.Otherwise known as: the film that beat Citizen Kane. It\u0027s also said to be future Oscar-winner Clint Eastwood\u0027s favourite film.This drama, depicting the life of an unassuming British housewife (Greer Garson) in rural England during World War II, won six Oscars in total. After almost missing out on a nomination due to a technicality, Casablanca went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director for Michael Curtiz.Leo McCarey\u0027s collaboration with Bing Crosby wasn\u0027t just the biggest hit at the 1944 box office, but a ten-time Oscar nominee that  marked a first: a Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nomination - for the same actor (Barry Fitzgerald).This drama, following Ray Milland\u0027s alcoholic writer, was the talk of the 1946 ceremony, winning four trophies in total.2090 The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)This war drama was the talk of Hollywood after winning nine Oscars, including two for veteran and non-professional actor Harold Russell, who remains the only person to have won two awards (Best Supporting Actor and an honorary trophy) for the same role. Controversial in its time, Gentlemen\u0027s Agreement follows a journalist (Gregory Peck) who poses as a Jew to research an exposé on the widespread distrust and dislike of Jews in New York City. It won three of the five Oscars it was nominated for.Hamlet stands tall as one of the most successful Shakespearean adaptations at the Oscars, as well as the first British film to win Best Picture.2390 All the King’s Men (1949)This adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel of the same name starred Broderick Crawford as the ambitious and occasionally ruthless politician, Willie Stark.This Best Picture winner won six Oscars, but left lead stars Bette Davis and Anne Baxter – both nominated for Best Actress – empty-handed.2590 An American in Paris (1951)Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron lead this musical version of George Gershwin\u0027s orchestral composition that won six Oscars in all.2690 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)Many consider this film to be one of the worst Best Picture winners in Oscar history, and was the last victor to win fewer than three trophies until Spotlight in 2016. Many believe it beat its competitors as it was a chance to honour Cecil B DeMille whose films had failed the main prize.2790 From Here to Eternity (1953)Fred Zinneman\u0027s romantic drama took home an impressive eight out of 13 nominations, including a Best Supporting Actor win for Frank Sinatra.2890 On the Waterfront (1954)Marlon Brando won his first Oscar in this Best Picture winner from Elia Kazan.Marty – starring Best Actor victor Ernest Borgnine – was also the fourth American release to win the coveted Palme d\u0027Or at the Cannes Film Festival.3090 Around the World in 80 Days (1956)The adaptation of Jules Verne\u0027s classic novel won five Oscars, beat out a particularly tough category that included epics The Ten Commandments, Giant and The King and I.3190 The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)The 30th Oscars ceremony awarded David Lean\u0027s epic war film that saw Alec Guinness take home Best Actor.Leslie Caron fronted classic MGM musical Gigi, which won nine Oscars – a record for just one year.Ben-Hur is the first of only three films to win 11 Academy Awards (see also: Titanic and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). It was nominated 12 times, losing only to Room at the Top in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.One of the last black-and-white Oscar winners as Hollywood moved towards colour in films a matter of years after The Apartment\u0027s release.

One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was a 1.4 percentage point increase on the application rate in 2018.It comes despite a 1.8 per cent fall in the overall number of 18-year-olds in England.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “I expect the confirmation of home fee status next year could have helped the numbers, although so could the weak pound as it makes life in the UK cheaper for both EU and non-EU students.”The number of applicants from China increased by a third this year - rising to 15,880, which brings Chinese applicant numbers to almost the same level as those from Wales and Northern Ireland.On the rise of applications from 18-year-olds, Ms Stevens added: “These figures show there remains a strong appetite for university study. Time spent at university opens-up lifelong opportunities for students and prepares them for an uncertain and competitive job market.”Universities accept fewer students as overall A-level pass rate dropsUniversities \u0027should do more to tackle student mental health crisis\u0027Unconditional offers may mean A-level students take \u0027foot off the gas\u0027Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) think tank, told The Independent: “There is so much uncertainty at the moment with Brexit but getting a degree is almost an insurance policy against future problems.”He added: “We know that the people that are most worried about Brexit are young people. They are the ones who think, rightly or wrongly, that the future has been made more difficult for them.“The more highly skilled you are, the better your life chances. It is a very rational thing that young people are doing.”James Seymour, director of admissions at the University of Buckingham, said: “Although there’s lots of uncertainty around Brexit there’s a feeling of certainty when it comes to doing a degree in the UK.“There’s a feeling of ‘it’s my choice’ regardless of what is going on with Brexit. There have been some question marks over apprenticeships but people feel they can trust a degree.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: In this time of uncertainty, it\u0027s welcome news to see more EU and international students wanting to come and study in the UK.Alongside this, demand from UK 18-year-old students remains strong, despite the falling numbers of this age group in the population.The unexpected rise in the application rate from English 18-year-olds, against the population trend, signals they still recognise the challenge and rewards of full-time undergraduate study.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: It\u0027s excellent to see that 18-year-olds in England increasingly value a university education, with a record rate of applications.We are also pleased to see a record high in the percentage of young people from disadvantaged areas applying to university.However, we need to be more ambitious. To retain a competitive advantage on the global stage post-Brexit we must encourage and support more of the population through higher level study.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

William Cook travels to Brussels to meet the famous duo, who have\u0026nbspturned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artworkClick to followThe IndependentGilbert and George outside their house in Spitalfields: ‘We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us’In a dilapidated old arsenal on the industrial edge of Brussels, Gilbert and George are singing the music hall song that made them famous. Their audience seem a bit bemused, and who on earth can blame them? “Underneath the Arches” is as British as warm\u0026nbspbeer or test match cricket, and equally incomprehensible to European punters. First performed by a very different duo, Flanagan and Allen, way back in the 1930s, it was already a golden oldie when Gilbert and George started singing it in art galleries 50 years ago.Half a century later, it’s become the theme tune for their lifelong career as Living Sculptures. No wonder these continental liggers are nonplussed. To anyone who isn’t steeped in British culture, with its weird passion for nostalgia, Gilbert and George must seem very odd indeed. “We never wanted to be weird because all artists like the idea of being weird, and we never wanted to be normal because everybody’s normal,” says George, by way of explanation. “We like to be weird and normal at the same time.”Gilbert and George are here in Brussels to open Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs. Each year, a famous artist is invited to be Brafa’s guest of honour. Last year, it was Christo. This year, it’s Gilbert and George. Their big bold artworks are scattered around this huge hall, an incongruous contrast to the antique paintings that surround them.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis juxtaposition is surreal – and here in the Belgian capital, the city of Magritte, that’s really rather fitting. For Brexit-obsessed Britons, Brussels may be synonymous with the European Union, but for Europeans it’s always been synonymous with surrealism – and what could possibly be more surreal than Gilbert and George?Despite their matching suits, and shirts and ties, they’re easy to tell apart. George looks like Eric Morecambe. Gilbert looks like Ernie Wise. However, unlike Eric and Ernie, they’re more than just a double act. They live together, they work together, they always appear in public together. This has been their way of life since they met, in London, in 1967, at St Martin’s School of Art (now Central Saint Martins). Their artworks are striking, and often bizarrely beautiful, but they’re a sideshow compared to their greatest work of art: themselves.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George: portraits and works Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Gilbert and George in their local cafe in Spitalfields, 2017Gilbert and George outside of their favourite restaurant, Mangal II, a Kurdish restaurant in Stoke Newington 2017 Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Portrait of Gilbert and George RA after receiving their medals at the Royal Academy of Arts on May 2, 2017Gilbert and George, 2015Gilbert and George in their younger yearsGilbert and George - SFG (2013)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - HANDBALL (2008)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - TEACHER STRAIGHT (2011)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD RAIDS (2016) Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George - BEARD MAD (2016)Gilbert \u0026amp George, White Cube and Albert BaronianGilbert and George, 2017Early morning.

Everyone assumes so, but no one seems to know for sure, and their public life is far more intriguing than whatever they might get up to in private. Young men feature prominently in their work, women are conspicuous by their absence, but you wouldn’t call these pictures homoerotic. Indeed, there’s something strangely sexless about them, like artworks from another planet.Their\u0026nbspDirty Words\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspNaked Shit\u0026nbsppictures caused a predictable furore (the titles are self-explanatory) but most of their work isn’t overtly controversial. The most radical thing about them isn’t their art, but the way they’ve merged their inidual identities into one.‘Fake’ Hitler paintings seized by German police in BerlinThey’re reluctant to discuss the details of their lives before they met, but their backgrounds are fascinating. When pressed, they stress the similarities – they were both war babies from provincial, lower-class, unartistic families – but the differences are far more notable, and the most notable difference is that one half of this very British duo wasn’t originally British at all.Gilbert Prousch was born in a small village in the Italian Dolomites in 1943. His father was a shoemaker, like his grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great grandfather before him, but after the war mass-produced shoes became much cheaper and so Gilbert’s father struggled to make a living. Inspired by Michaelangelo, Gilbert studied art in Salzburg and then in Munich, where he heard about St Martin’s. He travelled to London and wangled a place on its internationally renowned advanced sculpture course. He didn’t speak a word of English. He still speaks with a strong Italian accent today.George Passmore, conversely, speaks like a BBC newsreader from the 1950s. He was born in Devon in 1942. His father left home soon after George was born, possibly before. His mother was uninhibited, and George had a succession of “uncles”, which must have exposed him to gossip in postwar Totnes. At state school he showed a talent for art, which eventually won him a place at Dartington Hall, a private school renowned for its progressive attitudes. Inspired by Van Gogh’s letters, he went on to art school, and ended up at St Martin’s, on the advanced sculpture course, with Gilbert Prousch.“George took an interest in me,” says Gilbert. They became friends – and then lovers? Last time I met them, in their home in London, I asked them if it was love at first sight. “No,” said George. He described their relationship as something that happened gradually, “like an atmosphere or a cloud”. Do they ever wonder what might have happened if they’d never met? The idea clearly seems inconceivable to them. They believe they were destined to be together. “It was fate,” says Gilbert.The sculpture course at St Martin’s was (in)famously laissez-faire. Students could do whatever they wanted, which suited Gilbert and George just fine. “St Martin’s was the best art school in the world,” says Gilbert. “This was a school that said to an artist, ‘Anything goes. You are free to think in different ways.’ No other art school did that.” His art training in Munich had been traditional and academic. “St Martin’s was different – anything could be art.”Their fellow students included Barry Flanagan, Bruce McLean and, most notably, Richard Long, who turned walking into an artform. Gilbert and George went even further. They turned their lives together into a perpetual, seamless artwork. As Gilbert says, “We were the centre of our art.”While Long set off into the wilderness, Gilbert and George wandered around London’s East End. It was here, in a Dickensian junk shop, that they found an old record of “Underneath the Arches”, and came up with the idea of singing along to it, for hours and hours on end. They called this artwork The Singing Sculpture. “We felt we were doing something different,” says Gilbert. Like all the best ideas, it was both in keeping with, yet contrary to, the spirit of the times. Conceptual art was all the rage, but most of it was terribly earnest. Their Singing Sculpture was full of fun.Brafa, one of Europe’s most prestigious art fairs\u0026nbsp(Fabrice Debatty)“For the artists who were showing in those galleries, colour was taboo, figuration was taboo, sex was taboo, feeling was taboo – and these were all of the things we were interested in,” says George. Other artists got drunk in the evening, then went back into the studio in the morning to make sombre, sober art. Gilbert and George turned their drunken revels into art.They couldn’t get any public subsidy, and they had no family money to support them. Looking back, they now believe this gave them an advantage. “We could feel more free – we didn’t have to fit in in any way,” says George. “Middle-class people are more constrained.”They got their big break at a group show in London called When Attitudes Become Form. When the curator declined to include their work they gatecrashed the private view, and stole the show with their Living Sculptures, standing in the middle of the gallery like showroom dummies. Konrad Fischer saw them at this show, and asked them to perform in Düsseldorf. In Düsseldorf they were seen by Illeana Sonnabend, who invited them to New York. Fischer and Sonnabend were two of the world’s most influential art dealers. Gilbert and George had arrived.Around the same time they moved into a Georgian townhouse in Fournier Street, in London’s Spitalfields. They’ve lived there ever since. It was a poor area when they moved in. It’s got a lot smarter since, but it’s still a tough old place. The tramps that used to live there have been replaced by drug addicts, but they don’t mind this shifting cityscape – they embrace it. “We are very optimistic people,” says George. “We are never against anything.”Like a lot of their boldest statements, this is only partly true. They were certainly against the artistic orthodoxy of the 1960s and 1970s. In their suits and ties and starched white shirts they stood out a mile. “To be an artist you had to be critical. You had to be against the bomb, or against America, or against the Conservatives or against Labour,” says George. “We thought, ‘How marvellous it would be if we didn’t have to be Anti!’” It’s a philosophy they maintain when people bring petitions to their front door. “If it’s for something, we sign it. If it’s against something, we don’t sign it. We must have signed for some horrible things, but at least we were for.”Living in Spitalfields has been absolutely central to their art. “We really believe that Fournier Street is the centre of the world for us,” Gilbert tells me. “It’s an amazing mixture of different kinds of people.” Spitalfields has long been a refuge for arriving immigrants: Huguenots, Jews, Sikhs, Muslims… “The East End of London is a mixture of so many countries, a mixture of so many different people.” This is just the way they like it. “You face the modern world whenever you step out of the front door,” says George.They’ve exhibited all around the world, but though their pictures attract a lot of interest, wherever they go the main attraction is always Gilbert and George. It’s the same story here in Brussels. It’s like attending a press conference with Quentin Crisp and Oscar Wilde. Sure, it’s the same show every time, more or less, endless variations on a single theme, but it’s still more entertaining and enlightening than talking to any other artists I can think of.They set off for a walk around Brafa, followed by a swarm of hacks. “Our motto is ban religion,” says Gilbert, as they pause for photos in front of one of their monumental pictures. Religion loomed large in both their childhoods: Gilbert was raised a Catholic George’s brother became a vicar. Their artworks are oddly reminiscent of stained glass windows, but they’re both devout atheists. “We don’t believe in God,” says Gilbert. “All the gods are manmade. We are in charge of what we are doing in this world.”“We’ve always firmly believed that the national galleries of the world should remove all of the Christian art and hand it back to the Church,” says George. “They can look after the insurance and maintenance and conservation, and give over the national museums to humanist art, not Judeo-Christian voodoo.” George tells a story about an elderly vicar who knocked on their front door. “I thought it was marvellous that you said Ban Religion,” he told them. “My congregation come to church every week, and they’re all very religious. But I don’t want them to be religious. I want them to be good.”“We believe in the enlightenment, when people became human for their own sake,” adds Gilbert. “They didn’t need God anymore to make themselves human.” Their heroes are Charles Darwin and Alan Turing.We stop in front of a montage they made from tabloid posters, which they stole from outside newsagents. “It’s not a very easy thing to do because the shopkeepers don’t like you to do that, so one of us would go into the shop to distract the shopkeeper while the other stole the poster,” confesses George. “After three and a half years we ended up with more than 3,700 posters, and then we ided them into subjects – the ones which said Rape, the ones that said Murder, the ones that said Mugged, and ended up with a very big group of pictures.” They only got caught once. “We were very polite and gave it back to the shop, but we went the next night and stole it again.”‘Honest posters’ take down this year’s Oscar nomineesMan mistaken for employee strolls out of art gallery with $1m paintingThe rise of graphic novels, from To Kill a Mockingbird to SabrinaDespite these rebellious attitudes, they’re reassuringly old-fashioned. They don’t use the internet, or mobile phones. The only time they use the telephone is to book a table at the local restaurant where they’ve eaten for the past 20 years. After 50 years in the spotlight, they still maintain they’re outside the art establishment.Maybe they were, once upon a time (when they met, in 1967, homosexuality had only just been decriminalised) but that time has long since passed. Today they’re Royal Academicians who’ve exhibited in virtually every major gallery across the globe. If they were ever anti-establishment, the establishment has long since absorbed them. Yet for all their success there’s still something discreetly anarchic about them, a hint of danger behind their impeccable manners and immaculately tailored suits.They’re now lionised by the art world, but they don’t like hobnobbing with other artists. “We had friends in London, Paris, Germany, New York, a huge group of friends – drinking, celebrating, parties – and then one day we cut it off, we stopped,” says George. “We realised it was all to do with gossip and business – the nightmare of a world that has nothing to do with being an artist.” “We wanted to be free of gossiping,” says Gilbert. “We have friends, but we don’t want artist friends.” Though the art world has appropriated them, and sanctified them, they’re still outsiders at heart.So what advice would they give to an aspiring young artist starting out today? “Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, sit on the edge of your bed, keep your eyes closed, and don’t open them and stand up until you have decided, ‘What do I want to say to the world today?’” says George. Gilbert’s advice is a lot more succinct: “Fuck the teachers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Those hoping for a return to the mystical island filled with hostiles, hatches and Hurley may have to wait a bit longer, although Cuse and co-creator Damon Lindelof have previously said they expect a reboot to occur at some stage in the future – but they won’t be attached.In 2017, Cuse was reported as saying: “Damon and I are pretty adamant about the fact that we don’t have any intentions of rebooting Lost. I know that there are a lot of shows that have been rebooted lately, but we are not on that path.“Independent Minds Q\u0026ampA session on the Middle East, Trump, Syria and IsisCuse wrote Lost alongside co-creator Damon Lindelof until its series finale in 2010. Lindelof went on to oversee HBO’s little-seen standout The Leftovers which drew to a conclusion in 2017 after a season many hailed as one of the greatest in recent memory. He’ll next tackle an adaptation of Watchmen for the premium cable service.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is unlikely the pair will ever be heard from again.It has been more than a month since the robots were last heard from and they are now millions of miles beyond the red planet.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut Nasa considers the very fact it could talk to them at all a major success. The two craft pushed up against the limits of experimental technology, they say, and helped prove concepts that could allow such tiny robots to venture even more deep into space.MarCO was th first interplanetary mission to use a class of small spacecraft known as\u0026nbspCubeSats. Together, the pair worked as communications relays during the landing of InSight, a Nasa rover that dropped down around New Year and will be delving deep into Mars\u0027s surface.The two spacecraft were able to beam back data during the descent of the lander in near real-time, and sent back the stunning first images that were taken by InSight. The craft even did some science of their own: WALL-E took its own photos, and EVE did some simple radio science.Because the technology was experimental, Nasa weren\u0027t relying on either of the CubeSats working at all. If they had broken on their way – as engineers suspected they might – the data would still have been sent back but it would have taken much longer to receive it.After their work was done at Mars, they carried on off into space. WALL-E hasn\u0027t sent a message since 29 December, and is thought to be more than a million miles past Mars EVE is even further away, at about two million miles, and hasn\u0027t spoken to Nasa since 4 January.Nasa\u0027s Mars InSight lander sends back stunning first selfieResearchers don\u0027t know exactly why the pair have lost touch. WALL-E has a leaky thruster and might be wobbling so that it can\u0027t send commands. The sensors that allow them to charge their batteries from the sun might also have broken.They will continue flying away from Earth as February goes on, making sending any data\u0026nbspever more difficult and so meaning that Nasa don\u0027t expect to ever hear back.This mission was always about pushing the limits of miniaturized technology and seeing just how far it could take us, said Andy Klesh, the mission\u0027s chief engineer at JPL.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what about the impact on firms that only sell in the UK? Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture? What about those companies that simply serve the domestic\u0026nbspmarket? What about smaller companies? What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected. That applies as much to small independent shops as it does to department stores.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

But it is still beautiful, not only geometrically with its lines and curves against the fluidity of the ocean, but also as an emblem of a British seaside culture slowly fading.On the euro, the UK would have lost the opt-out, and be required to fix the pound’s exchange rate irrevocably to the euro, and to transfer the running of UK monetary policy – interest rates – from the Bank of England to the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We\u0026nbspwill not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom. This devilish euro maniac is doing his best to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control.”Asked about the row, Ms May’s official spokesman said: “It’s a question for Donald Tusk whether he thinks using that language was appropriate.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayOn a two-day visit to Belfast, Ms May set herself at odds with Brexit hardliners by saying she was seeking “changes” to the controversial backstop, rather than its total removal from the withdrawal agreement.The backstop\u0026nbspwould see the UK tied to a customs union – and Northern Ireland\u0026nbspbound to some single market\u0026nbsprules – if a trade deal cannot be agreed.The DUP and Ulster Unionists are vociferously opposed to the mechanism but Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party argue it\u0026nbspis the only way to maintain a frictionless border\u0026nbsppost-Brexit.Ms Foster told reporters at Stormont there had been a “useful engagement” with the prime minister where the party reminded Ms May of their opposition to the Irish backstop, as the DUP believe it creates ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.She said: “We reiterated again the fact that the backstop was the problem in relation to the withdrawal agreement and the Brady amendment that was put down in the House of Commons last week gives her the mandate now to go to Brussels as she intends to\u0026nbspon Thursday and we look forward to hearing the outcome of that.“As I’ve said, the Brady amendment is clear in relation to the withdrawal agreement that the backstop needs to be replaced. That is her mandate and that’s what I expect her to take to Brussels.”Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald warned the prime minister that she risked breaking up the UK if she engaged in brinkmanship with the EU.She said: “We have told her that the British strategy of running down the clock and playing a game of chicken with Ireland and Irish interests is profoundly unacceptable and wrong.“We have told her that the days of Britain dictating to Ireland or Irish people, that those days are over and will not return.”She accused Ms May of acting in “absolute bad faith”, adding:\u0026nbsp“If British politicians cannot accept the specific needs of this country, of the Northern Irish, if British politics is incapable of acknowledging and upholding the Good Friday Agreement and the hardening of the border, then the only last option – the backstop of last resort – is a referendum on Irish unity.”Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, said\u0026nbspthe prime minister\u0026nbspgave no detail about what the “alternative arrangements” could be to replace the backstop in their meeting.‘We’re totally in the dark’ – Belfast locals on BrexitShe went on: “I am tired of people chasing unicorns. It has to stop, we don’t have time.“We need practical solutions that are going to actually address the realities that we are facing.”UUP leader Robin Swann said if Ms May cannot negotiate an extension and no deal is reached, then she must introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland.And SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that his party had told Ms May that it is now time to “put up or shut up”, as the backstop was only viable solution to the border issue.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The country’s future is at stake, and it’s about time the national interest took priority.”But the political logjam over Brexit appears to be putting the government’s legislation on hold in the aftermath of Theresa May’s deal being crushed by a historic margin.And given the lack of an agreed deal at Westminster – or knowledge of what the deal will eventually entail – it is difficult for the prime minister to make progress with five Brexit-related laws, including the fisheries bill, the agricultural bill, and the financial services bill.\u0027Special place in hell\u0027 for pro-Brexit campaigners, Tusk saysThis is why in recent weeks cabinet ministers such as the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, have suggested the government may need to delay Brexit by a few weeks in order to pass critical legislation – if Ms May eventually cobbles together a majority for an exit deal.Asked about the adjournment of the Commons at 3.27pm, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other significant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

The papers in their files were ignored, and the pleas of their families were swept aside,” Ms Harman added.“After the right to life, the right not to be unlawfully detained is one of the most important human rights. It should not be the case that a person has fewer protections from wrongful detention as an immigrant than they would if they had actually committed a crime.”The MPs also said detainees should have better and more consistent access to legal aid to challenge their detention, and that a reinstatement of legal aid for immigration cases should be considered.UN backs calls for time limit on UK immigration detentionSam Grant, policy and campaigns manager for Liberty, supported the calls, describing indefinite detention as an “ineffective and inefficient waste of money and human life”.\u0026nbspBella Sankey, director of Detention Action, also backed the calls, saying\u0026nbspa 28-day time limit was “urgently” needed along with early judicial oversight and safeguards against “cat and mouse” re-detentions.“The JCHR has expertly laid bare the injustice and abuse inherent in our current system.

They also frequently struggle to be granted refugee status if they have to make their asylum applications from inside a detention centre,” she added.The Home Office has been approached for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereAsylum and ImmigrationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In his first interview since announcing his run for prime minister, he cited the dismantling of settlements in Gaza in 2005 as an example that could be replicated in the West Bank.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“All sides had a lot at stake and the state managed to do it without tearing the country apart. It was done legally, carried out by the State of Israel and the IDF, and even though it was very painful for the settlers, it was handled well,” he said.“We must take the lessons of the disengagement and implement them in other arenas.”Many Israelis consider the Gaza disengagement under then prime minister Ariel Sharon a historic mistake that emboldened the Islamist group Hamas.Created with Sketch.Palestinians await Israeli demolition of their homes in the West Bank  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents prepare for their homes to be destroyed (Bel Trew)A toddler plays in the dirt of Khan al-Ahmar village (Bel Trew)Palestinian flags festoon the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar as they await eviction (Bel Trew)Children play as their parents brace themselves for the bulldozers (Bel Trew)Iman, 7, says she does not want to leave her home (Bel Trew)The demolition order includes the village’s school, which provides education for some 170 children from five different Bedouin communities.\u0026nbsp(Bel Trew)The playground of the school which will likely be demolished in the coming days (Bel Trew)But the continued growth of settlements in the West Bank is seen as one of the greatest barriers to an eventual peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 400,000 Israelis live in the territory, and a further 200,000 in East Jerusalem, both of which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Most of the international community views settlements as illegal – in 2016 the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution that described them as a “flagrant violation” of international law. Palestinians argue they harm the chances of a two-state solution by taking land that would eventually make up a Palestinian state.Settlement construction has surged under Donald Trump, who has taken a more relaxed approach to the issue than previous presidents. Data compiled by Peace Now, an advocacy group in Israel, found that construction had risen 20 per cent in the first nine months of 2018, compared with the year before.Speaking on Tuesday, the UN secretary general\u0026nbspAntonio Guterres\u0026nbspdescribed settlements as “a major obstacle to peace”, which should be “halted and reversed”.“Ongoing settlement construction and expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under United Nations resolutions and international law,” he said. “A two-state solution is the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and secure a sustainable solution to the conflict.”According to current polling, Mr Gantz is expected to win about 24 seats in the Knesset, trailing Mr Netanyahu’s Likud\u0026nbspby six seats.The former general,\u0026nbspfrequently described as “charismatic” in profiles,\u0026nbspwas the Israeli army’s chief of staff during the 2014 Gaza war, codenamed Operation Protective Edge. Mr Gantz has highlighted his role in the war in promotional material for his campaign.Israel launched the military operation in the Gaza Strip following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members. The subsequent war left more than 2,200 Palestinians dead.“Sixty-three per cent, or 1,391, did not take part in the fighting, including 526 minors,” according to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem. “It is estimated that 18,000 homes were destroyed or severely damaged and that more than 100,000 Palestinians were rendered homeless.” \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do they not want Britain to succeed Do they not see that their bizarre, condescending attitude is EXACTLY why they lost in  THE rocketing suicide rate amongst teenagers is nothing short of a national crisis.And the solution MUST involve the social media firms who are profiting from youngsters’ suffering.They have been given quite enough warning that they are not doing enough to protect vulnerable kids.They have said for years that they just need a bit more time, and that they’d fix the problem themselves.Well, they’ve failed.Government has no choice but to step in – and it needs a concerted effort from the Education, Health and Culture Departments.One more tragic death is one too many.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the wild exaggerations of Project Fear II about No Deal anarchy.It’s the Remainer MPs who voted to trigger Article , then lied to voters about respecting the referendum result even as they plotted to reverse it.It’s the brass-necked Tory MP who claimed “Brexiteers were lying when they said Nissan was going nowhere” — long after it was clear the war on diesel was really to blame for the U-turn on the new model in Sunderland.Next to all that, an over-optimistic prediction or two and a slightly inaccurate bus slogan look small beer.Lies  Remain ultras should look in the mirror.TO Corbyn’s disgust, the Government has recognised a new leader in Venezuela instead of the hard-left loon Maduro who has let millions starve.What’s Jezza’s alternative  Do nothing. Leave them to whatever grim fate awaits.Why  Because any Western intervention, even the aid they now desperately need, will prove that his lelong ideology has failed catastrophically.

They must not be allowed to dodge blame by rewriting their own.WHAT possessed Tory chairman Brandon Lewis to hound a woman over a porn snap she allegedly “liked” on Twitter His every focus should be on raising funds and attracting new blood to a party whose flagging membership has an average age in the late s.Instead he foolishly thinks there’s political advantage in shaming a Labour candidate over a smutty pic. Who cares Lewis has come a cropper before with hasty tweets. Like his demand for fellow Tory Boris Johnson to apologise over burka remarks most of Britain backed.But he’s just one of too many MPs who waste endless hours on Twitter, reducing politics to vacuous virtue-signalling or spiteful, tribal, juvenile point-scoring.No wonder voters are sick of them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship.’“He writes her a really long letter in , and he closes it by requesting a photo op with her.“She feels like, ‘That’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to communicate through the media. Did you hear anything I said ’“It’s almost like they’re ships passing.“He knows how to get in touch with her.“It’s super-painful because Meg was always so dutul.“I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. At the same time, because she’s a daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”The close friends spoke anonymously to US magazine People after Thomas made a string of public outbursts about his royal daughter and Meghan’s half-sister Samantha cashed in on their “non-existent” relationship.The Sun understands the pals spoke to People with Meghan’s approval, and that her press team at Kensington Palace were kept in the dark.One friend said: “Meg has sat silently back and endured the lies and untruths.“We want to stand up against the global bullying we are seeing and speak the truth about who our friend, a  mother-to-be, really is.“We worry about what this is doing to her and the baby. It’s wrong to put anyone under this level of emotional trauma, let alone when they’re pregnant.”The pals vehemently defend the Duchess and reveal she was devastated by her father’s response to her letter and did not talk to him after that.They also claim that:They said Thomas’s older children, Thomas Markle Junior and Samantha Grant, “were in their mid-to-late teens when  Meghan was born” and “were not a part of her le”.The friend added: “They’ve been made to appear as siblings who were very close and then they had this falling out, and that’s not the truth at all.“Fast-forward to Meghan dating Harry and now Samantha isname Markle. And then she began this career capitalising on Meg.“Everyone who knows Meg knows the two of them have no relationship.”The same friend also gave Meghan’s side of the story, after her dad Thomas pulled out of walking her down the aisle at the royal wedding due to a heart attack.They told the magazine Meghan had looked after her father financially, despite what  Samantha had claimed.They said: “Meghan’s been a rock for everyone in her family.“It’s a shame that it’s being painted in this other light that is just absolutely .“She took care of her father with such incredible generosity.“The fact that this could be flipped around, that she was acting out or not caring for him, is preposterous.“The Saturday before the wedding, she and Harry were told that a story was going to come out the next day saying that Tom was staging pictures with the paparazzi.“Their team told them thatthe story was fake, they could file a complaint.“So Meg calls Tom and asks him, and he’s swearing up and down that it’s not true. The next day the pictures come out.“Even with all that, Meg and Harry were still so focused on getting him to London.“At no point was there talk of, ‘Now that we know he lied, he’s in trouble’.“Tom wouldn’t take her calls, wouldn’t take Harry’s calls. The next morning when the car got there , he wouldn’t get in.“ Meg heard he’d had a heart attack and she’s calling him and texting him, even up to the night before the wedding.“It was like, ‘Please pick up.

When it comes to the future relations, we can have a look into alternative arrangements. But they can never replace the backstop.“We are sticking to the line that we set on Day One.”But Mr Varadkar held out hope for other changes when he revealed he had invited Mrs May to Dublin for Brexit talks over dinner on Friday evening.No last night played down the prospect of getting a breakthrough in time to put to MPs in next Thursday’s Commons votes.A senior Downing Street source said: “If the clouds clear then great, but realistically it’s not where we’re going.”The source added that the Government would have to put “something” down to vote on next Thursday but said he expects the “focus” will be on other amendments such as attempts to legislate against a no deal Brexit.Abandoning the new plan to instead fight for a time limit or exit mechanism to the current backstop instead risks infuriating arch Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group of hardline MPs.They insisted on Wednesday that the PM must demand the EU accept the unity plan or face a new Commons defeat next week.There is “a very slim chance” of Mrs May winning the next crucial Commons vote on February she doesn’t, a senior ERG figure said.But government whips now think they could whittle down the ERG’s rebellion to around  diehardsthe PM does win other legally binding changes.And up to  Labour MPs will back the PM’s Brexit dealshe allows Parliament a say in trade talks – ex-Shadow Minister Lisa Nandy declared yesterday.She said a commitment that Parliament could help “frame” Britain’s post Brexit direction after March  could be enough to get a huge number of opposition MPs over the line.Brits going from the mainland to Northern Ireland may need to have their passports stamped under the current Brexit deal, it also emerged.Expert analysis of the agreement struck in November carried out for Tory Eurosceptics has revealed the legal obligation on UK authorities would kick inthe unpopular Irish backstop is enforced.The revelation flies in the face of the PM’s promise to never ide up the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

The Prime Minister flew into Brussels to beg the bloc’s bosses to overhaul the controversial backstop issue so she can force a deal through Parliament. But Downing Street was downbeat about her chances of success with one No  insider predicting: “We know they’ll say no.”With just  days to go until Brexit Day, negotiations remain deadlocked and frustration in Brussels is mounting.Mr Tusk, President of the European Council, unleashed a furious tirade at Brexiteers who he claimed had convinced the British public to quit without knowing what would follow.   “I have been wondering what that special place in hell looks like for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan to carry it out safely,” he said.He also took a swipe at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - saying there was “no effective leadership” in the UK that would allow Brexit to be reversed.After making his comments Mr Tusk laughed and nodded as Ireland’s Leo Varadkar told him: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.” Furious Leave supporting MPs lashed out at the former Polish PM. Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said he should apologise for his “spiteful” remarks while Sammy Wilson, the DUP Brexit spokesman, described him as a “devilish Euro maniac”. Mrs May’s official spokesman told reporters: “I think it is a question for Donald Tusk as to whether he considers the use of that kind of language to be helpful.”   No  sees the trip - the first since the PMs deal was resoundingly rejected by MPs - as “part of a process” but it was unclear whether she had any detailed new proposals to put forward. There are three options under consideration - replacing the backstop with “alternative” arrangements, imposing a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism. The Mirror understands that the PM’s senior Brexit advisor Oliver Robbins has told ministers that a deal can be struck on a time limit to the backstop. In a private document drawn up before Christmas, he wrote: “Our advice is that a unilateral termination mechanism is likely to be rejected in strong terms, and lead to a prolonged hiatus. “A termination clause without a unilateral mechanism may be negotiable, but will need to be relatively simpleit is to be concluded quickly... “If we are pursuing a termination by mutual consent, this will still not be easy, but a discussion with the Irish government and Commission in parallel might be the best way forward.” The proposal is dependent on the Irish PM agreeing to accept a sunset clause. Mrs May will travel to Dublin on Friday evening for dinner with Mr Varadkar.  Ahead of today’s talks, Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement was not open for renegotiation. “She knows that the Commission is not prepared to reopen the issue,” he said. At Westminster, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said that Brexit Day should be delayed to give negotiations more time. Cabinet ministers have held secret talks about delaying Brexit Day by two months - but were slapped down by the PM at this week’s Cabinet. Brussels insiders confirmed they may be prepared to offer a “period of grace”the PM’s deal passes to allow extra time to get key legislation through. Ministers came under fire last night after the House of Commons rose more than four hours early despite Brexit uncertainty. Labour’s Diana Johnson said the situation was “bang out of order”. She added: “Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible!”SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: “Seemingly the Tory Government thinks there’s nothing worth debating or discussing.”The Government has cancelled the February recess for MPs with six key bills to get through before March . One No  insider suggested they would “pull out all the stops” including sitting through the night to get the two essential bits of legislation through in time. There were suggestions that ministers could publish a new employment bill before the next vote on the PM’s deal to win over more Labour MPs. The Mirror revealed last month that Downing Street was offering guarantees on workers’ rights - and it has also hinted at extra funding for Leave-voting Labour areas. Labour MP Lisa Nandy told BBC radio that up to  Labour MPs could be prepared to back a revised deal. Senior Labour insiders suggested the figure could be nearer a dozen. Earlier, Mrs May held crunch talks with Northern Ireland political leaders. Sinn Fein warned that Brexit should trigger an Irish unication referendum which could split the UK. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald said: “If British politicians cannot accept the specic needs of this country, of the north of Ireland,British politics is incapable of acknowledging and upholding the Good Friday Agreement and preventing the hardening of the border, then the only last option – the backstop of last resort – is a referendum on Irish unity.” The warning capped a frustrating morning for the PM with the Northern Irish parties claiming they still had no idea what strategy she would pursue. Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist SDLP, claimed there “is no magical solution” for technology to prevent a hard border. “We need to get over all this messing around,” he said. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Mrs May failed to set out which of the three options she will pursue with EU chiefs. “I’m tired of people chasing unicorns. It has to stop, we don’t have time,” she added.

Labours Diana Johnson said the situation was bang out of order, writing on Twitter : Considering Brexit is just  days away this is totally irresponsible! SNP chief whip Patrick Gray said: Seemingly the Tory Government thinks theres nothing worth debating or discussing.Proceedings began with Cabinet Office questions followed by Prime Ministers Questions. Ten minutes were then used up by the introduction of a backbench bill, before a debate on two social security motions. The adjournment debate focused on prostate cancer and started at .pm rather than pm, as would normally be the case. Elsewhere in Parliament, MPs were involved in afternoon debates in Westminster Hall - their second debating chamber - while proceedings in the House of Lords chamber began at pm and were predicted to run until pm.   The Government last week announced it was cancelling the February recess for MPs, and legislation connected to Brexit still has to be approved. Valerie Vaz, Labours Shadow Commons Leader said: “Theresa Mays zombie Government continues lurching from one crisis to the next. While the Government has been locked in bitter infighting and chaos over their botched Brexit negotiations, the needs of the country have been completely neglected. “This Government has no vision, no new ideas and crucially no legislation to fill the Parliamentary timetable.Best for Britain supporter and Labour MP Virendra Sharma said: “This is not on. Parliament still has tons of legislation to get through before the end of March, including thousands of pages of statutory instruments.   “Brexit is the most important legislative and political process since the Second World War. It makes no sense to go home and avoid working on ensuring the country’s future when there’s so little time left.”Downing Street insisted there was a lot of work going on. The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: The business of the House is set out in advance, there have been days recently where they have been working beyond midnight dealing with statements and with debates on Brexit.   I think this week they have been dealing with some important domestic statutory instruments and other signicant issues which are going to be debated in the coming days.

Adrian Hoare, , is accused of doing nothing when -year-old Stephen Waterson allegedly squashed three-year-old Alfie Lamb during a trip in his Audi convertible last February. Testying at the Old Bailey, she said she was scared of Waterson - and felt little when he bragged about his important family. Waterson was previously accused in court of using the fact his father is ex-Tory minister Nigel Waterson to make himself untouchable. She said she called her son my little noodle and fatpants. Hoare said: Hewas good with him. They had a bond as well. She said that Waterson also had a nickname for Alfie, calling him Tarzan. Asked about another name used for Alfie and she replied: Little s***.  Katy Thorne, QC, defending Hoare, asked: What about the name little s***  She replied: It was just another name it was not to be nasty or horrible it was just another name. Hoare told the court that both her and Waterson had hit Alfie in the past but only little taps. Waterson told the Old Bailey he lied to police after the incident because he was worried that he would get in trouble because the driver of the car, Marcus Lamb, had been disqualied. He told emergency operators he had been driving by and stopped to help try and revive Alfie.  The couple then claimed Alfie had been injured in a taxi which had driven off. A message sent from Hoare to Waterson just hours after the incident at .pm on February  of last year was read to the jury. It said: They know that we are lying. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting,said: Even before you had reached the hospital you did not know what lies she had told the police, you were trying to get her alone and away from the police. Waterson answered: No-one was allowed in the room with Alfie, Alfie was with doctors. I did not know what lies she had told the police.  Mr Atkinson said: You were trying to get her alone. Waterson asked him: Is it a crime to be alone with your partner  He added: I have already admitted lying in the beginning, I have pleaded guilty to it, lies were told, I did not want to get anyone in trouble. Waterson is accused of deliberately moving his seat back because he was annoyed at Alfies crying. Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Hoare said she felt scared when her partner was annoyed or angry, adding: You never knew how he was going to react to things. The hairdresser told jurors how police had been called after an incident in Gravesend, Kent, the year before Alfie died. She said she had been at a friends house when she heard Waterson had been seeing another woman. I asked him over the phone what was going on and we started arguing. He had come down to Gravesend in the car and asked me to go and speak to him. I had gone to speak to him and he had said that to me to get in the car. He started driving stupidly and he was shouting at mehe did not carehe killed us in the car. He was driving at speed and he did not carethere was other cars coming towards him or anything, she said.  Katy Thorne QC, defending, asked: When he said he did not carehe killed us, who was us  Hoare replied: I had just found out I was pregnant at the time. He was saying himself, me and the baby. She went on: I was scared and I eventually got him to stop the car. He then took me back down to near where my friends car was and went back to her house to speak to the police. My friends had been ringing Stephens phone trying to get him to take me back to the house and saying they would ring the policehe didnt.  Ms Thorne asked Hoareshe knew Watersons family had some important jobs. Hoare replied: He used to put it in conversation, yeah. Asked how it made her feel, she said: Little compared to him but I didnt really have anything. Hoare described Alfie as like any normal three-and-a-half-year-old boy. The defendant, who had a troubled upbringing in Gravesend, said: He could be naughty. He would try to climb about. He had a good imagination. Hoare said she used to call Alfie her little noodle and fat pants, while Waterson used the nickname Tarzan.  On February  last year, Alfie was captured on CCTV running around and holding his mothers hand. Hoare said Alfie had been happy on the shopping trip but began getting tired and stroppy. On Watersons relationship with her son, Hoare said: There had been times that Stephen had told him not to do something or he would tell him to be quiet and Alfie would not listen so he had got annoyed with him sometimes. Hoare denied she had hit her son, but said both she and Waterson would tap his hand. She told how she met Waterson in  after she moved to Blackpool for a fresh start. Her previous boyfriend was jailed for setting fire to her house in Gravesend, jurors were told.  Waterson had a big personality and was nice but did not like her speaking to other people, she said. Hoare suspected he had been unfaithful with ious women during their relationship. But she said: When I confronted him with it, he said I was being silly, I was being paranoid. Hoare and Waterson, of Croydon, south London, have denied manslaughter and the trial continues.

Adam Lamb said the teen smiled at him and was chewing her sleeve as she walked past him in the street in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . He had closed a car door to make it easier for her to pass, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She smiled asto say thanks. She was chewing her sleeve and walked along Westfield Lane, he told the inquest. She was looking into the bushes asshe was going inside them and then she was gone. After a TV appeal, Mr Lamb dialled  the next night and passed on details, saying he believed she was aged between nine or .  Chief superintendent Rob Grfin, for Nottinghamshire Police, who is responsible for missing person teams, said police officers spoke to Mr Lamb, but he was among many callers who reported sightings although they did not know her. Unfortunately the officers didnt ask Mr Lamb to take them to the scene and conduct a more thorough search, he said. Mr Lamb was like many others who describes a person who generally fits the bill for Amber rather than I know Amber. The bushes were dense and Mr Grfin said officers would have been forgiventhey had not found her hanged. A pathologist said there was no evidence others were involved in her death.  The inquest was told Ambers mother suspected her of attention seeking on the night she left home. PC Nicola Roe filled in a missing person form while speaking to mother Kelly Peat. She was told Amber had been asked to empty a cool box, was not happy about it and left. Assistant Coroner Laurinda Bower, who is conducting the hearing at the Council House in the city, asked about her observations of Mrs Peat. She seemed matter of fact when she was describing the situation, the officer said. The coroner asked: Did that surprise you  The officer said: Not really, to be honest. She seemed not particularly emotional or upset, maybe frustrated.  She described her background, referred to Amber throwing temper tantrums, what she called attention seeking. Mrs Peat said Amber had gone missing before and ed home safely.The mother seemed well rehearsed in giving information the officer said. PC Roe told the coroner: They expected her back the next morning. The coroner askedshe knew the family went to Tesco and had their tea before alerting the police that Amber was missing. PC Roe answered: I dont remember being told that or discussing specics with them. The inquest heard Ambers case was initially classed as medium risk by Nottinghamshire Police. When she had disappeared before while living in Derbyshire, that force graded them as high given her personal circumstances the coroner said. The inquest continues.

Sun lovers Laurel Cormack and David Crook say the luxury five-star resort in Corfu looked like a swamp. They had been looking forward to spending two weeks at TUIs Mayor Verde Grand Resort in Agios Gordios, which has a well-publicised private beach. However when the couple got there they found the usually golden sands littered with towering ft-wide smelly seaweed mounds buzzing with flies. David claims they were only able to spend half a day on the hotel beach and had to abandon their sunbeds due to the seaweed-choked waters and head to the crowded hotel pool.   The recruitment consultant blasted TUIs cavalier attitude to their complaints and for failing to inform guests of the natural phenomenon in advance so they could make alternative plans. TUI said they were sorry to hear of their disappointment and would be in contact with them again. David, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said: Were very much beach people and always book hotels with their own piece of beach with them. If were relaxing we prefer to sit on the beach rather than by the pool as it always gets crowded. The black seaweed was in very long strips andyou put your foot in it it would stick to your legs. In the water it was ft deep.   The seaweed was smelly and had a lot of flies around it, the water wasnt clear either. The holiday wasnt as good as it could have been as the one facility we paid for [the beach], the whole reason we picked that hotel, we werent able to take advantage of. When we booked the holiday online I was expecting the golden sands I saw in the brochure, not mounds of stinking seaweed. The -year-old said both he and his customer service assistant we Laurel, , were taunted by glossy promotional videos displayed in the hotel showcasing the resorts unspoiled beaches.  David said: The really irritating thing was in the main reception they had a big -inch TV with a continuous looped video. It kept showing all the bits of the hotel that wed booked the holiday for and werent able to use because they were seaweeded out. They were even playing in the lts and showing the same thing - we couldnt get away from them. Grandad-of-one David said that diggers were out at am scooping up the seaweed from the sand and dumping it in mounds on the hotel area of the beach instead of taking it away. David said: When we complained about it the TUI rep shrugged her shoulders and said theres nothing we can do, the hotel and local authority is doing all they can.  The diggers were there a couple of hours from am on a few mornings trying to clear the beach but as fast as they moved it the seaweed ed. They werent removing it though just piling it up, it was an eyesore. Apparently a couple of weeks before we were there there was a dredger that took away about  tonnes of seaweed. We werent there for that but you dont order a dredger and get diggers on the beachits not a problem. We could have used the less affected public beach further along but that would have entailed paying for sunbeds, parasols and snacks which defeats the object of going all inclusive. Our argument has always been never about assigning blame or responsibility for the seaweed. Its a natural phenomena, its not the hotel or TUIs fault and I never said it was.  What I was really incensed about was the fact that all theyre doing is hiding behind it being a natural phenomena. It first started at the end of March and we went in June - theyd known about this for three months. Do they not monitor their resorts for this type of event  Do they not noty customers  If wed had an informed choice we wouldnt have cancelled our holiday, but we would have just gone to a dferent resort not affected by it. I dont want a load of money back, I just want them to hold their hands up and admit its something they should have made people aware of.  I wouldnt want other people to go through the experience, its just wrong. David complained to TUI in writing and said he was disappointed with their response - even receiving a missive thoughtlessly sent out. David said: I had an email from one TUI rep again explaining it was a natural phenomenon and that she was sorry about the incontinence this has caused. My first thought was that the email hadnt been put through spell check or checked for any autocorrects it was just speedily bashed out with little or no thought. Ive also tried speaking to them on the phone and on one glorious occasion was on hold for  minutes listening to a continuous loop of the same song - by the end of it I was losing the will to live. Dad-of-two David said the experience had put him off booking a TUI holiday in the future. David said: The cavalier attitude TUI took has meant that we will never use them again and nor would we recommend them. The amount we paid might not be a lot of money to a lot of people, but its a big chunk of money for us. Were not wealthy people were just normal working people - its our two weeks of rest and relaxation. TUIs whole attitude really disappointed me, its just left a really bad taste in the mouth. I never said it was their fault, all I was saying was do you not monitor your resorts for this kind of occurrences to let people know so they can make an informed choice about whether they want to proceed with it or not  A TUI spokesman said: Were sorry to hear of the Cormack partys disappointment and we will be in contact the customers directly once again to discuss in further detail.

And within just a few hours David Mearns managed to track down the missing Piper Malibu on Sunday, which was on its way to Cardf when it disappeared last month.Sala’s family appealed to the marine scientist after an official search for the aircraft was stood down and an online crowdfunding campaign to fund it raised more than pound,. But those who know David were not remotely surprised the man known as The Shipwreck Hunter was able to locate the plane so quickly. The expert, who was born in the US but is now a British citizen living in Sussex, has helped solve some of history’s greatest maritime mysteries.   He has lead searches for shipwrecks that have been at the bottom of the sea of decades, even centuries, making  major historical discoveries over the last  years. Using sonar technology and remote-controlled submarines, his expeditions have also set records for finding wrecks at extreme depths - and even helped solve crimes that would have remained forever undetected. But despite his successes he still dreams of finding one wreck which has eluded him - Sir Ernest Shackleton’s Endurance, which crashed into ice and sank off Antartica in .  He told the Times in : “If I could cap it all off with Endurance, I would be a happy, happy man because it is the ultimate shipwreck search in terms of dficulty and challenge.“Harder than Titanic. Finding a deep-water shipwreck in the Weddell Sea when it is covered in ice, you are not going to get any harder than that.” Most of David’s finds, though, have been the result of exceptionally hard work - often years of research, months at sea and millions of pounds. And with three Guinness World Records for underwater discoveries, including one for the deepest shipwreck ever found - the German blockade runner Rio Grande, which was discovered at a depth of ,ft - he is now regarded as the man to turn to when it comes to retrieving from the ocean floor. One of the -year-old’s most famous discoveries was the HMS Hood, one of Britain’s greatest battleships, which was sunk by the German navy’s Bismark in May .  There were just three survivors among the , on board, their lives saved by an air bubble that pushed them back to the surface. Among them was Ted Briggs, who David had met and sought consent from before setting out for a Channel  documentary to find the ship in . He eventually found the wreck at a depth of , ft at the bottom of the Denmark Strait, where he got another Guinness World Record for the deepest live broadcast on the internet, with live footage of the HMS Hood being streamed around the world. But he later recalled how there was none of the usual shouts of excitement when the ship was finally discovered. He said: “There were no whoops or joy of back-slaps. It was such an emotional and sad moment for me. I didn’t feel like celebrating in any way.”  When a plaque was placed on the wreck, now a recognised war grave, he made sure that it was Ted Briggs’ hands in control of an underwater robot when it wasreleased onto the wreck. He remembered: “For Ted personally, it allowed him a chance to say goodbye to his shipmates, to remove from his shoulders the guilt that he had felt his whole le as one of only three who survived. “In a sense, he laid a ghost to rest. It was something that I’ll never ever forget - a very proud moment for everybody that we witnessed that.” Other sunken warships he has found with his company Blue Water Recoveries include the HMAS Sydney, an Australian navy battle cruiser sunk by the Germans off Australias west coast in November , killing . It was the the country’s greatest maritime mystery for  years until he found the ship in . David also found the hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off Queensland by a Japanese submarine in , for which he was awarded an honorary Medal of the Order of Australia.  He was also part of a team in  led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which located the wreckage of the Japanese battleship Msashi in the Sibuyan Sea. And in  he found a wreck he believes to be the SS Athenia, the first ship sunk in the Second World War at a cost of  lives when German U-boat commander Fritz Julius Lemp torpedoed the transatlantic liner – believing it was a warship – just hours after Britain had declared war on the Nazis. Describing his care with such wrecks, where many lives were lost, he said: “The sanctity of those grave sites and whoever has been lost is very important. “They are major unmarked grave sites, with no head stones to show who has been lost there, and that why we take this effort andto put plaques on the wreck, to leave a marker that those people haven’t been forgotten.” David, who trained as a marine biologist, began his career as a search and recovery contractor for the US Navy.  But his le changed forever when he was tasked with finding MV Lucona, a cargo ship which was blown up in the Indian Ocean in  at the cost of six lives. After finding the ship at ,ft, he found it had been blown apart by a bomb for an insurance fraud by Austrian businessman Udo Proksch, who was subsequently convicted in  of murdering six of his crew. He went on to defy the odds by finding dozens of other lost vessels, many of which had been shrouded in mystery for decades, boasting a  per cent success rate. Describing the months he often spends at sea searching for wrecks, he says: “Being on the water is great, I love being out there.  You see some days when it’s call, and days when it’s really mountainous seas. You’re working every minute of every hour when you’re awake.” He says that the discovery he’s most proud of was the SMAS Sydney, which nobody thought would ever be found. He said: “It’s not exaggerating to say that all of Australia was following that search. We had the worst luck, everything went wrong. Equipment failures, bad weather, the ship broke down…” He said he felt “pure exhilaration” when it showed up on his sonar.   In March , David announced the discovery of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gaza’s Esmerelda, which sunk in . It is believed to be the earliest ship from Europe’s Age of Discovery ever to be found and excavated. Despite his extraordinary career, David says he will only be satisfied when when he finds three elusive wrecks. One is the legendary Endurance, but he won’t reveal the other two as shipwreck hunting is a competitive business. He says: “There’s three of them, and I haven’t given up on them. They leave this tortured feeling that you have, of unfinished business.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hatton garden heist suspect basil","story":"NewsHatton Garden heist suspect \"Basil\" seen on CCTV outside safe deposit in wigMichael Seed, , is alleged to be the raider caught on CCTV helping to steal £million worth of gold, jewels and cashShareByTom Pettor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video cctv-shows-hatton-garden-suspect-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHatton Garden heist alarm specialist “Basil” may have used a key to get in through the front door of the safe depshyosit building, a jury has heard. Michael Seed, , is alleged to be the raider caught on CCTV wearing a wig and face mask while helping to steal poundmillion worth of gold, jewels and cash. The court was shown footage of the man known as Basil, who police also referred to as Male A, taking something from a pocket seconds before opening the front door of - Hatton Garden. Asked how Basil got in, Det Sgt Jamie Day told the court: “I would suggest either by a key or had access some other way.” Another clip captured the raider on the second floor where the lt was disabled, allowing access to the shaft through which the burglars could climb down to the basement vault.  Jurors were also shown images of cut burglar alarm wires. Prosecutors allege that it was Seed who disabled the alarm. The gang’s loot was stolen from  safe deposit boxes over the  Easter Bank Holiday weekend after a hole was drilled through the vault wall. The court heard five of the six men who were present – Brian Reader, , John “Kenny” Collins, , Daniel Jones, , Carl Wood, , and Terry Perkins, who died last year aged  – have been convicted of conspshyiring to carry out the safe deposit heist in London’s jewellery quarter.

Now Jacky Rom, from Romford in Essex, is desperate to trace the man caught up in the mix-up, because he was much nicer than the man she ended up meeting. Jackie had arranged to meet a man on dating app Plenty of Fish.When she arrived at the Fox and Raven in Chelmsford, she was excited to be greeted by a man with a twinkle in his eye, Essex Live reports.But sadly for her it turned out the mystery man was supposed to be on a date with someone  - and the mix-up only came to light when their real dates turned up. Now Jacky is desperate to find the man she thought she was meant to be dating.  Jacky, who has a -year-old daughter and has been single for nine months, spent Monday morning preparing for her first ever blind date, dressing to impress. She said: When I pulled up in the car park I saw a guy behind me and thought he looked nice, I did think it was a bit funny that he didnt say hello. I went inside and ordered a drink and sat down, when he walked in he came over to me straight away greeted me with a peck on the cheek and said I thought you were a red head. When he said that I didnt think much of it, because I have always had dferent coloured hair, I just thought I was pleased with my choice.   He had a twinkle in his eye and he was a gentleman, even though I wasnt what he expected when he saw me he said its ok, it doesnt matter. He then went over to the bar and got himself a drink, at which point my actual date walked in. It was only a matter of minutes that Jacky spent with the man she mistook for her date but she said: It didnt even occur to me he was the wrong person I didnt even think of that I thought oh a nice guy for a change. My actual date was no where near as nice as the other man, but we all at that point had realised what had happened and laughed about it. When the red head turned up shortly after the four went their separate ways and continued their dates.   Jacky, who is an author, said: It was so annoying, we were sat there chatting away and I was not giving him my full attention. I was thinking about pretending to go to the toilet and instead running outside and putting my business card on his car windscreen, because I knew what car he had as he followed me in. But after about  minutes they just left and I couldnt do anything, I didnt knowthey had had a good date or not. Jacky has been single for nine months and downloaded Plenty of Fish around a month ago to seeshe could find love, and this was her first ever blind date. She said: Its a shame I had the coffee with the wrong one. I would like the chance I missed. Now, having recovered from the embarrassment, she wants to track down the mystery man. The four shared a moment of awkwardness before laughing it off. Jacky described the man as being around  foot tall with an unusual haircut. She said: It was grey and it was closely shaven at the sides and longer on top, he looked very stylish and was wearing grey skinny jeans. Jacky estimated his age to be around - but she couldnt recallthe man had facial hair or not. She also described him as having a local accent. Despite downloading Tinder, match and Bumble in a bid to find the man, Jacky has had no luck and reached out to Essex Live for help. She said: I would kick myselfI didnt at least try to reach out and find him.

A teacher of Amber Peat, , Karen Green told an inquest at Nottingham Council House the schoolgirl had mentioned having a big secret. The -year-old was found hanged on June  , three days after leaving home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Karen Green, vice-principal of the Queen Elizabeth Academy, Mansfield, had a phone call with social services regarding Amber, reports Nottinghamshire Live. She said: My gut instinct is theres something not right here. I cant put my finger on it. She had called seeking help over the -year-old who had recently become a pupil at the school after the move from Derbyshire.  One of Ms Greens comments referred to a big secret, Amber says she is not allowed to talk about it. This was thought to refer to her stepfather Daniel Peats criminal conviction for fraud, the inquest heard. Another phone call mentioned that Amber becomes stressednot allowed access to food in school, giving potential issues around her diet, the coroner Laurinda Bower said. The teacher also spoke about Amber twice running away. The coroner said: There was information that the family moved from the previous school when people started to work with them.  That suggests a potential lack of engagement. Ms Greens call was taken by Elizabeth Fisher, a member of the multi-agency support hub. She said a social worker had to make a decision on stepping up support for Amber and this was not done. I didnt feel there was enough for a full referral, said Miss Fisher, who told the inquest the decision was not hers to make, adding: Social workers are the trained staff. The coroner suggested one factor for a referral for extra care wasparents were involved in crime. She askedthat information passed to a social worker. Miss Fisher replied: I would have told them why dad was in prison.  Amber was found hanged after a family row shortly after they had all ed from a holiday in Cornwall. A pathologist said there was no evidence to suggest anyone  was involved in the hanging. The inquest has previous heard the teenager was woken at midnight for two hours to do cleaning jobs around the house. The hearing was told the teenager was also punished by having to use a carrier bag to take items to class rather than using a school satchel.  The coroner was referring to a phone call from Sharon Clay, a team leader at Queen Elizabeth School, Mansfield. Amber had recently become a pupil after the family moved from Tibshelf. The call was taken by Joanna Shepherd, a member of a multi-agency safeguarding team in Notts. The coroner asked whether this was regarded as emotional abuse. Miss Shepherd, who was giving evidence, said: It could possibly amount to emotional abuse. You would need more detail and content.  The coroner said other information had been compiled about Amber while the family were Derbyshire residents and efforts could have been made to get the bigger picture. The hearing continues.

But when they pulled over the truck, at the wheel was frail and doddery -year-old great grandfather Leo Sharp. And in the back they found  kilos of the drug. The decorated war veteran uttered three words: “Oh my God.” Sharp’s extraordinary transformation from a renowned plant grower to one of America’s most successful drug couriers has now been turned into a film, The Mule, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. In  alone, Sharp delivered more than a ton of cocaine – enough for . million people to each snort a line – making himself million.  But his criminal career came to an end when, on his th birthday, he was sentenced to three years in jail. Sharp’s lawyer, Darryl Goldberg, argued during the OAP’s trial that he was suffering from dementia and turned to crime over money worries. Mr Goldberg says: “I don’t think state troopers and highway patrolmen were suspicious of an elderly man driving cross-country. “He was an older man. He was entrepreneurial and adventurous and he was likely suffering from dementia and the hallmark of dementia is poor decision-making. “So when you put them all together it is a recipe for him making the very wrong decision in a moment of perceived financial weakness and perhaps that contributed into his desire to pursue something like this.” Sharp’s story started very shydferently, however. Chicago-based lawyer Mr Goldberg, recalls: “He was a Bronze Star recipient in World War Two, his time in the Army was a le story in itself.  “He fought in Italy at the famous battle at Monte Battaglia. If you read the description of the battle it is fascinating as bayonets and flame throwers were used in hand-to-hand combat. It is remarkable that people survived. His service sparked the travel bug in him and he was quite the world traveller.” After the war Sharp started a travel business and at one point even launched his own airline. But a passion for flowers brought him rock-star status among fans of daylilies – small trumpet-like flowers that come in an array of colours. On a farm in Michigan City, Indiana, he cultivated more than  dferent ieties and would attend conferences across the US dressed either all in black or white, where fans would queue to meet him. Neighbours recalled buses pulling up outside his -acre farm, packed with growers wanting to buy his plants. But the coming of the internet caused his customers to buy online where. With his business failing, it is believed one of his Mexican farmhands introduced Sharp to the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, headed by the ruthless Joaquin Guzman, known as El Chapo. The kingpin, currently on trial in New York, shipped an alleged  tons of cocaine. Yet elderly Sharp quickly emerged as the cartel’s most effective mule. In his beaten-up Lincoln truck he would transport  to  kilos of cocaine from the US-Mexico border and drive sedately up to Detroit.  Members of the cartel sneered at him behind his back for his advancing age and gave him the nickname El Tata – The Grandfather. He sometimes got confused when he tried to find the secret stash houses, so cartel members would be sent to meet him at motorway exits and guide him to warehouses. When he wanted to quit, they responded by putting a gun to his head and threatened his family. His lawyer Mr Goldberg enjoyed hearing the stories of his well-shytravelled client. He said: “He was a gentleman farmer, he did not live an extravagant le. “Despite the shycognitive decline he knew what he was getting into. “There came a point where he was less enthused about the process and that’s where they threatened him. He had a gun put to his head. He was the largest mule in Detroit and based on the numbers, he was monumentally substantial.” Drug Enforcement Agents in Detroit were astounded at the quantities of cocaine flooding the city, led by the legendary El Tata – a name constantly mentioned on the wiretapped phones of gang members. Special agent Jeff Moore, played by Bradley Cooper in the film, had spent a year trying to trace El Tata but to no avail. But thanks to the wiretaps, they knew the drug runner was making a delivery to Detroit in October . The truck was spotted near Kalamazoo and soon a host of unmarked police and DEA cars were trailing the mysterious mule. El Tata was driving erratically and at one point cut across traffic to leave the highway, sparking fears he knew he was being followed.  But he was just picking up French fries and a drink from a drive-through. At .pm a State Trooper, who was in on the operation, pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. Out of the truck stumbled a scruffy old man, cupping his ear so he could hear the officer’s commands. The trooper’s dashcam records the old man saying: “What’s going on, officer  At age , I want to know why I’m being stopped.” A drug-snfing dog was brought in and immediately drew attention to the back of the truck. When police said they were going to search, Sharp replied: “Why don’t you just kill me and let me just leave the planet.” In the back were five duffel bags containing  kilos of cocaine.  Sharp was later given three years in a jail specialising in the medical care of long-term inmates and as part of the deal had to hand over , and a property in Florida. “He said he was sorry for what happened” Mr Goldberg says. “He was quite matter of fact and nonchalant about it. He told the judge at sentencing, ‘I’m terribly sorry but it happened and I can’t change it’.” Sharp served just one year of his sentence and died after  months of freedom in December . He is buried alongside the military heroes of the Second World War, Korean and Vietnam wars in a shymilitary graveyard in Hawaii. Mr Goldberg says: “I enjoyed spending time with him. I found him fascinating on many levels. There was a lot of knowledge and wisdom to be shared and he had three shyincredible le stories built into one.” The Mule is out now.

This is a national scandal staring at us in plain sight. The figures are damning: the number of people living in the streets has risen by % since the Conservatives came to power, more than  die sleeping rough each year, , households are homeless. But statistics never tell the full story. That is why the Mirror wanted to give voice to those who have fallen on hard times. Their stories are of people who have struggled with addiction, people with mental health problems and people with nowhere  to turn. They are scared, lonely and destitute. Many tell of how they have been assaulted, had their tents stolen and let down by the services supposed to support them. There are also stories of great kindness and compassion. The volunteers who get up at the crack of dawn to check on rough sleepers in their area, the charities which provide vital support and the health workers who have mended broken lives. Above all, we heard time and time again from people who never thought they would be in this position.  As one homeless person told us: “people are a tissue-thin slice away from disaster, they just don’t think about it.” In a country as rich as Britain this shouldn’t be the case. We are seeing the consequences of a government which stopped caring. The safety net which should be there has been torn to shreds. You could point to the Universal Credit or the shortage of accommodation or the lack of drug treatment services or the paucity of mental health provision. All are responsible for the rise in rough sleeping and all flow from the cuts imposed by this Tory government. What makes this so shameful is there is a better way. The Housing First strategy pursued in Scotland is transforming lives by giving people a secure home and support for addiction or mental health problems. If the Government is serious about tackling rough sleeping it should follow this approach. We have given those on the streets a voice. Now we need to give them hope.

The former World Champaion passed away on February  aged just  - and his le could not have been more dferent to his former glory.At the pinnacle of his fame following the  Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, Nykanen had the world at his feet. A contemporary of British legend, Eddie The Eagle Edwards , he also won four World Cup titles.  But fast forward just three years and his le had begun to spiral out of control. Rather than being top of his game, Nykanen finished in th place at the World Championships. And it was now that his world off the slopes also began to crumble. Nykanen earned himself the reputation as the George Best of winter sports - he has been married six times.  After giving up his illustrious sporting career, he tried his hand at everything from pop stardom to stripping. But his addiction to booze, convictions and even prison spells for assault and even driving off a bridge tarnished a once impecible professional reputation. The Finnish skiing superstar had always been disruptive. Aged eight he was diagnosed with ADHD - but this is what lead to his incredible skiing career.  His father, Ensio, was desperate for his son to have an outlet for his aggression and begged his son to try ski jumping. Nykanen was a natural and by age  was practising for up to nin hours a day.

But, nicknamed the Flying Finn, he was unstoppable on the slopes and  was his glory year with four Olympic gold medals. Following his disastrous performance just three years later, Nykanen retired and changed tack completely. He reinvented himself as a pop star and enjoyed some success in the Finnish charts. But his second album was savaged by critics and a commercial failure.  By  Nykanen was broke and changed career yet again, this time becoming a stripper in a Helsinki casino. It didnt go well. Staggering across the stage he was booed off. Then things went from bad to worse for the Flying Finn. He appeared in an erotic film and even worked for a sex chat line - a far cry from his le as the hero of the slopes.  Refusing to give up on his music career, Nykanen recorded a third album poking fun at the controversial last years called Maybe I Had A Drink, Maybe I didnt. By  things had totally collpased for Nykanen. He stabbed a friend in the back while playing a game of finger wrestling and was jailed for  months.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united sign former st johnstone defender mark connolly","story":"Dundee United have signed defender Mark Connolly from Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee.Irish-born Connolly joins United on a contract until the end of season .As a youngster, he spent a season at St Johnstone and two seasons at Kilmarnock where he became club captain between two separate periods at Crawley Town.He has represented Ireland at Under , Under  and  level.The -year-old becomes Robbie Neilson#s ninth signing of the January window and third of a busy final day.

defeat against Rangers as both teams finished with  men at Pittodrie.The Dons deserved something from a match that they dominated for large spells, striker Sam Cosgrove grabbed a double for the Reds, but it wasn#t enough.Alfredo Morelos bagged a brace for Rangers before being sent off along with Aberdeen defender Scott McKenna following an altercation early in the second half.A controversial penalty scored by James Tavernier, that was given against McKenna, and a stoppage time strike from Jermain Defoe sealed the Gers victory.Dons boss Derek McInnes made one change to the team that beat Hibs - at Easter Road on Saturday with Stevie May dropping to the bench and McKenna coming in to start after recovering from the hamstring injury he sustained in the - draw with Kilmarnock on January .Striker Cosgrove and goalie Joe Lewis both started after having to be subbed at the weekend. Cosgrove shook off a back problem and Lewis was fine after getting a gash above his left eye following a collision with a post at Easter Road.The Reds started brightly and on six minutes Max Lowe#s long throw fell for Greg Stewart who hooked a snapshot narrowly over the bar.Soon after Lowe was almost clean through after linking with Stewart down the left, but good defending from Connor Goldson ushered the ball back to Allan McGregor.Just after the quarter hour the Gers had a big chance when former Don Ryan Jack borrowed into the box down the left, his low cut-back was half-cleared by Tommie Hoban to Morelos who fired right across the goal face from  yards.The visitors led on  minutes when Ryan Kent#s shot from just inside the box was parried by Lewis and Morelos stabbed home the rebound from six yards.On the half hour Aberdeen levelled with through Cosgrove. Stewart tricked his way into the area on the right and stood up a cross which Tavernier headed clear.The loose ball dropped for Lewis Ferguson, whose volley from  yards was blocked but it rebounded for Cosgrove to sweep home from eight yards # the Englishmen#s th goal of the season.It was only - for eight minutes as Rangers got their second and again it was Morelos.A powerful run from Jack ended with him finding Morelos and from  yards the Colombian placed a low left-footed shot into the bottom left corner.Morelos was fortunate at that point not to be in referee Bobby Madden#s book at that point for a number of petty, niggly fouls.Three minutes before the interval things got worse for the Dons when Madden awarded Rangers a controversial penalty.Tavernier#s free-kick from the right was flicked on by Goldson and struck McKenna#s raised hand at point-blank range, it looked harsh given the Scotland defender being so close to Goldson.Despite Aberdeen protests it was a penalty and Tavernier found the bottom right corner from  yards despite the valiant attempts of Lewis to save it.The Reds needed to make a fast start to the second half and they did, pulling a goal back within two minutes of the restart.They won a corner on the left and as the ball was being played in Tavernier wrested Ferguson to the ground, whistler Madden was well-placed and pointed to the spot from which Cosgrove made no mistake firing down the middle.At the other end Lewis made a good smothering stop after Morelos, who looked suspiciously offside, broke through.The Dons were on the front foot and a mazy run down the left from Gary Mackay-Steven saw him send an angled drive narrowly wide of the near post.But on  minutes the game changed as both sides were reduced to  men.McKenna beat Morelos to a ball in the box and cleared his lines, as Morelos went to challenge he appeared to kick McKenna once the ball had gone.With the Dons defender on the ground he was deemed to have retaliated with a kick back, it didn#t appear to look like much but Madden brandished the red card McKenna#s way before doing the same to Morelos.After this the Dons kept up the pressure and only a block from Joe Worrall denied Stewart after he weaved in from the right and shot.Rangers seemed content to sit in and try to hang on to their - advantage with Aberdeen pushing for an equaliser.James Wilson came on and had one shot saved by McGregor and another deflected behind for a fruitless corner and the on-loan Manchester United man almost slipped in Cosgrove on another occasion.It was one-way traffic and with a couple of minutes of normal time left McGregor pulled off a fine reflex save after Hoban had flicked on Stewart#s scuffed shot from a corner.At times Rangers were struggling to get far beyond their own penalty area due to Dons# pressure but in the seven minutes of stoppage time the Govan side broke away on the counter attack and Tavernier fed sub Jermain Defoe who slotted home their fourth from  yards.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan , Andrew Considine, Tommie Hoban, Scott McKenna, Max Lowe , Graeme Shinnie, Lewis Ferguson, Greg Stewart, Gary Mackay-Steven, Sam

aberdeens sinking flats","story":"Dozen of residents on two Aberdeen streets could face being moved from their “sinking” homes, the Evening Express can reveal today.Councillors will meet tomorrow to discuss the fate of residents living in  blocks of flats on Errol Street and Errol Place, near King Street, as the ground under the properties is sinking.The long-running subsidence issue was first identied by residents more than two decades ago, with two blocks having been demolished in the past.Four options will be put before members of the city council’s growth and resources committee when they meet in private session at the Town House tomorrow – including knocking the remaining blocks down and moving residents where in the city.An Errol Street resident, who asked not to be named, said the local authority “condemned the houses” on both streets around  years ago due to “subsidence issues”.She added: “They were due to be pulled down  years ago but that didn’t happen, and since then only two buildings have been demolished.“The residents want clarity. My house is one of the worst affected, the ceilings don’t even touch the walls anymore.“My husband and children have had to move in with family because of health issues so I’m living here alone.” vw, px\"  Subsidence occurs when the ground under a property collapses, or sinks lower, taking some of the building’s foundations with it.This puts strain on the home’s structure as one side sinks, causing cracks to appear. Many of the residents have also reported damp problems and cold flats.It is understood the four options on the table are for external repairs, micropiling and ground beams, mass concrete underpinning and demolishing the buildings then rehoming the residents. All options other than external repairs would result in residents being rehomed, with the building work displacing people in the area for up to five years.Micropiling and ground beams – where strengthening rods are drilled into the ground – would take five years to complete, mass concrete underpinning four years, and external works six to eight weeks. vw, px\"  It would take around  weeks to totally demolish the buildings.John and Marilyn Davidson have lived on Errol Place for  years and believe demolition is the only option.John said: “We have had damp in the bedrooms. The conditions of the houses are awful.“They should demolish them – they’re that bad.”The couple said they have been plagued with issues like windows and doors “twisting”.Even when their front door was closed they could see outside through a crack next to the hinge.John added: “They aren’t worth anything. We’ve been here  years and the only work that’s been done is external painting.“The stairwells were meant to be redone but they never have been. The doorway is twisted and so are the window frames. There are times we can hardly lock them.“They’re not worthwhile living in.”Marilyn added: “I wish they would make up their minds about what they are doing.”Another resident, James Gray, , who lives on Errol Street, said he was one of the lucky ones, having avoided issues like damp in his home. He too, however, would like to see the buildings demolished. vw, px\"  He said: “They said it will take four or five years to do all the underpinning, and they can rehome everyone. I must be one of the lucky ones. It’s a cold flat, there’s a draught from the windows, but I haven’t had any damp.“There’s nothing concrete been decided. There’s seven houses empty, the one next door has been empty for two years. It’s a shame when there’s people homeless.“I’ve lost my family over the past couple of years so I want to move. I was going to go away for a month in January with my daughter and son-in-law but then all of this happened and I couldn’t.“They’ve said they would move us into a like-for-like house.”Agnes Brands, , who lives in Errol Place, said she would like to stay in her flat. She added: “They are very cold.“I have had the roof leaking before for a while. I’ve been here  years. I’m not able to move. Some of the people want to flit but I’m not able.“Will the council help you out  I can’t move my stuff.”Councillor Sandra Macdonald, who represents the area, stressed that the homes were not a danger to the residents.She said: “They’re safe for habitation – we wouldn’t have people living in them otherwise.“There was a consultation with residents in September and as far as I’m aware they were split half and half.“Some want to stay because they have friends and family.“Anecdotally older folk want to stay in their homes.“At the end of the day I don’t think doing nothing is an option – I don’t think anyone wants to just mend and repair.“It has to be either concrete underpinning or demolishing the buildings.“It has to be the best decision for the residents and our tenants as well and the council’s finances.”Cllr Macdonald said the decision will be taken tomorrow but it would take a “while” to negotiate with homeowners.She added: “There’s a complete range of tenants who are all wanting to know what is going to happen in the longer term.”"},{"url":null,"title":"north east lifeboat crew teams up with brewery to create fundraising beer","story":"A new north-east partnership hopes the creation of a beer will help raise cash to save lives.Peterhead Leboat has teamed up with Brew Toon brewery to make the drink, with % of the profits going to the charity.Craig Aird, crew member at the leboat and a regular in the Brew Toon bar in the town, had approached the company about collaborating to create a beer.After months of discussions, nine members from the RNLI charity jumped at the chance to create the beverage, and it is hoped it will be ready by next month.A classic, New England-style IPA is currently fermenting and will be called Mayday.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"piping hot performance ayr stars","story":"NewsPiping hot performance from Ayr starsAyr Pipe Band Society took to the stage to support the world-renowned bagpipe band Red Hot Chilli Pipers.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  FEB NewsAyr Pipe Band Society gear up to support Red Hot Chilli Pipers at Ayr Town Hall \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPiping stars joined together to wow crowds at a top show in Ayr’s Town Hall.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week

about plans to increase the number of subjects currently on offer, as suggested by inspectors.In order to provide six subjects in the senior phase, the school is considering increasing the number of periods in the week to seven a day.Consultation with pupils and staff began in August last year, and Mr Fyfe emphasised how much the opinions of parents are valued in the process.The school is looking at a choice of two new timetable models: Monday to Friday with seven periods, giving  periods a week or three days a week with seven periods and two days a week with six, giving  periods a week.At the

additional subjects, assist junior students in class, and volunteer in the community to gain Saltire Awards.Special arrangements will still be possible to enable other wider achievements such as gaining a driving licence.Mr Fyfe said: #We want our young people to make the best use of their time at school and gain valuable experiences which will benefit them when they leave.#S and S pupils will soon be required to give their initial option choices to allow the school to judge demand for each subject, although these will not be final.Mr Fyfe also shared the results of a parents and

midpoint of winter, half way between the shortest day and the spring equinox.For Christians it has a particularly special meaning as it was  days after the birth of Jesus and the day when, according to Jewish custom, his grateful parents took him to the temple to give thanks to God.We believe that Jesus is the light of the world who will guide us through our own dark times.Many customs have grown around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

Glasgow Airport and Paisley Gilmour Street has emerged as the likely alternative to a full tram-train rail link.Following a meeting between Glasgow and Renfrewshire council leaders, the Transport Secretary and Glasgow Airport yesterday, it has been agreed to work on a business case for the Personal Rapid Transit system.It would see passengers board the pods like ones used at Heathrow Airport to take them to the station at Paisley where they would catch existing services to Glasgow and where.AYE OR NAW, MICHAEL :Our message to transport secretary amid fresh fears over airport rail linkThe final choice will be between the tram-train option and the Personal Rapid Transit pod.It is, however, likely that the rapid transit option will be the preferred one and the option taken forward.The tram-train link hit problems following a study that said it would impact negatively on other services in the West of Scotland and on Central Station which is at capacity.The Evening Times message to the transport secretary earlier this monthSusan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council, said: ldquoImproved connectivity to Glasgow Airport is a key priority. However, the advice from officers and consultants is that signicant questions remain about the deliverability of the current tram-train option, particularly in relation to capacity at Central Station.ldquoAs a result, the Executive Steering Group has agreed additional work should be done to establish an alternative Outline Business Case for a Personal Rapid Transitoption.ldquoThis work was not advanced by the previous City Deal Cabinet, but it is now crucial in order to allow us to make a fully-informed choice about which of the options in front of us should be progressed.:Glasgow Airport rail link saga has dragged on for far too longldquoI remain committed to a solution that delivers improved public transport connectivity to Glasgow Airport - but I am determined it should also provide value for money for the city, and deliver the widest possible inclusive economic benefits.ldquoIrsquom confident we have made signicant progress towards that outcome today.Glasgow Airport said congestion on the M means action is needed and ldquodoing nothing is not an option.Mark Johnston, managing director at Glasgow Airport, said: ldquoWe were informed that, due to issues around rail capacity, the project partners are developing an alternative option.: Half a million to go on addressing airport rail link fearsldquoThis will be evaluated and we will, of course, work with the partners to promote the delivery of an effective solution within the agreed timescale.It has been understood that transport officials were not keen on progressing the tram-train link from Glasgow Central to the airport.Michael Matheson, Transport Secretary, said: ldquoItrsquos crucial that improving access to Glasgow Airport is balanced with the needs of the regionrsquos existing transport network.ldquoThe Personal Rapid Transit system option potentially meets this aim, and I look forward to seeing the revised business case once itrsquos completed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-too-soon-to-make-informed-decision-on-independence","story":"The First Minister also said she had yet to make up her own mind about a fresh vote.In an interview on American TV, she said she would wait for a Brexit conclusion, and only then take a decision ldquobased on a calm consideration of whats in Scotlands best interests.:Nicola Sturgeon in US: Its clearer Scotlands national interests are not served by WestminsterHinting at a long process, she told PBS NewsHour that voters had a right to ldquoas much information as possible about an independent Scotlandrsquos relationship with the UK and EU.She did not want an ldquouninformed decision about a big change, as with Brexit.The cautious language will disappoint the gung-ho elements of the Yes movement, including some past and present SNP MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum this year.Ms Sturgeonhas been urged to capitaliseon the \"chaos\" at Westminster.Herpreference for\"calm consideration\"reflects the complications ofBrexit, which could change Scotlandrsquos options on the economy and the currency.Theresa May also continues to withhold referendum powers from Holyrood, making it unlikely that a referendum can be held before the next Holyrood election in .Ms Sturgeon is in the US and Canada this week to promote Scottish interests.In a speech to the Georgetown Institute on Monday, she repeated her commitment to give an update on the timing of another independence referendum in a ldquofew weeks.But in her PBS interview, the First Minister suggested this may not be the call to arms many of her supporters would like.She said the Brexit vote and the way Scotland had been ignored by London in the aftermath showed ldquocircumstances have changed materially since , the trigger set down in the SNP manesto of  for Holyrood having the right to call another referendum.She said: ldquoWhen the time is right for Scotland to look again at the question of independence, I think, would be the right thing to allow it to do.But asked when she thought the time would be right, she replied: ldquoWell, I think we have to allow the [Brexit] process that is currently underway to reach some conclusion. What that conclusion will be remains to be seen.ldquoAnd then take a decision based on a calm consideration of whats in Scotlands best interests. And thats what I would do.ldquoSo Im not going to say right now what I think the best timing would be.Pressed on why she didnt go ahead with a referendum given her complaints about Scotland being ignored during Brexit, Ms Sturgeon said voters didnrsquot have enough facts to decide.She said: ldquoClearly,people in Scotland are being asked, given the opportunity to look again at the independence question, they have a right to have as much information as possible about what -Scotland chooses to be independent - what our relationships will be with the rest of the UK and with Europe.ldquoAnd some of the answers to those questions inevitably depend on the Brexit outcome to some extent.

And when people, as I believe they will in due course, opt for Scotland to be an independent country, that should be on the basis of a genuinely informed decision about all of the implications and consequences.Ms Sturgeon first promised a ldquoprecise timescale on another vote in June , after SNP losses in the general election derailed her plan for a Brexit-related referendum.The update was due in October but has been repeatedly put off because of the rolling confusion and delays over Brexit at Westminster.The hold-ups on Indyref have been criticised by SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil, and former FM Alex Salmond has questionedthe ldquocaledonian leboat will ever launch.The SNP is currently refreshing its economic case for independence through Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, but Brexit would add a new layer of complications.For instance, in , the SNP argued an independent Scotland could continue to use the pound as part of a currency union with the rest of the UK.Howeverthe UK were outside the EU, it is highly unlikely that Brussels would allow an independent Scotland to join the EU while also using the currency of a non-EU state."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-we-dont-need-neutral-referees-just-better-ones","story":"Rangers were in the lead back in August. Remember up at Pittodrie, after the very first game, when Steven Gerrard bemoaned the lsquoworld being againstrsquo his club. Later on came the suggestion Willie Collum was biased, and not in favour of the famous Glasgow. It was a strong case. Or not.But then Neil Lennon claimed Hibs played against  men in a defeat at Celtic Park referee Don Robertson being the extra man.Motherwellrsquos Stephen Robinson wanted officials to go full-time so they could do their jobs properly Steve Clarke has been a constant critic of our men in the middle, while Craig Levein is, well, Craig Levein and loves a moan.Derek McInnes was furious with Andrew Dallas who awarded Celtic a penalty in the League Cup Final for a handball that wasnrsquot a handball which wasnrsquot inside the box but the Aberdeen manager has been knowns to take a pop and his chairman, Stewart Milne, didnrsquot hold back this season when he spoke of the ldquoserious issues surrounding referees.And then came last weekend and those four penalties at Ibrox. Mr Dallas, again, found himself in the centre of a hullabaloo.And to top it all, former ref Steve Conroy insists he was only Jungle Jim among his colleagues, most of the rest were bluenoses, and Tom Boyd, former Celtic captain, insisted ldquoneutral referees must be bought in because our current crop were not good enough and, going by the word he used, biased. Irsquom guessing against Celtic.Ironically, the only one speaking adult was Oran Kearney whose St Mirren team were the ones actually hard done by.And while his players were never going to take a point from Ibrox, that defeat and now a worse goal dference edged them closer to relegation, which will mean sackings and wages being halved. You know. Real stuff.They canrsquot all be right. They canrsquot all be wrong. Andyou look outside the world is still spinning, even after some dodgy decisions which at least gives us all something to talk about. But it feels aswersquove reached rock bottom in terms of how Bobby, Willie, John, Andrew and Steven are viewed.What troubles me still are the less than subtle suggestions from supporters of Rangers and Celtic who have lsquoproofrsquo of mysterious forces out to get them, whether it be Opus Dei or the masons.Oh, and Referee X drinks in the Louden Tavern or Brazen Head. The clubs, incidentally, donrsquot exactly distance themselves with this behaviour.There is a film called lsquoAnyone but Celticrsquo with scenes filmed inside Celtic Park and with a guest appearance from, would you believe, Tom Boyd. You can guess what the plot, pun intended, is.Celtic have won over  trophies, including the last seven in a row. They are one of the most successful football clubs on the planet. Perhaps the film should be retitled lsquoAnyone but Celtic donrsquot win anything in Scotland.rsquoOh, and the idea Rangers are hard done by is laughable. Some of the nonsense which have come by way of the statements shames the club.Right, here goes. The referees in Scotland arenrsquot very good. They are not given enough help by their assistants, fourth official and the SFA. That they arenrsquot allowed to talk in public is a shambles and puts them under even more pressure.The only consistency in decisions made on the park and inside Hampden is that there is gross inconsistency.Every single club believes itrsquos them against everyone . Ask the supporters of Albion Rovers and they will have as many tales of awful officialdom from this season as any those mentioned above.But referees in Scotland are not cheats, which Boyd suggested. However, they need to improve, as do the three colleagues they have with them for Premiership games.If our game is crooked, we need to scrap it and start again.

Dave Morris, a former Director of Ramblers Scotland, said the national park authority had wrongly focused on campers as the cause of the scourge, and believes it is day trippers and those driving through who cause much of the problem.\"Goodness knows whether the appointment of a Litter Manager on a salary of around pound, pa is going to make any dference,\" Mr Morris said.\"In its -plus years of existence this national park has demonstrated that it hasnt a clue about how to deal with litter and is more interested in spending its resources on the persecution of innocent campers than dealing with the real culprits.\"However, a spokesperson from Loch Lomond  The Trossachs National Park Authority said: \"The national park is one of the most beautul places in Scotland but unfortunately litter can be a problem blighting some parts of this outstanding landscape, especially during peak periods.:Plans to ban wild camping from parts of Loch Lomond given green flag#\"Addressing this issue is one of our key priorities and we have recently appointed a Litter Prevention Manager who will be responsible for developing a National Park-wide litter prevention strategy, working with partners to drive positive change.\"Although the National Park Authority is not responsible for collecting much of the litter left in the national park, we are leading a joined-up approach to tackle this issue together.\"Our new Litter Prevention Manager will play a vital role in helping to work collaboratively with stakeholders throughout the national park to prevent litter spoiling the natural beauty of the area.\""},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-life-is-full-of-ups-and-down-for-sir-chris-bonington","story":"GROWING old, continued.

But the one that stands out happened to me when I was myself a patient. After an accident breaking my thumb, I awoke back in the ward to find the affected limb in plaster and suspended from a drip stand. The other arm was strapped to a board and had an intravenous line running. I was literally handless. The kindly ward orderly told me Id missed dinner but she would find me some dessert. Falling back asleep, I next opened my eyes to a plate on my bed table holding an unpeeled orange. Its the thought that counts.\"Bowled overAND Catriona Kellock in Alva admits: \"As a young student nurse in Edinburgh, many years ago, I was given the job of handing out the meals. One gentleman had not ordered pudding and askedthere was a spare one on another tray. He had seen his neighbour with semolina, his favourite. I found a bowl on another tray and gave it to him. When I came to clear up, he hadnt finished it, saying sheepishly, I really prefer the sweet kind of semolina. I looked at the bowl and realised I had given him boiled potatoes in white sauce. They looked very similar.\"GetawayTHE SNP is being attacked for giving local authorities powers to levy a tax on workplace parking spaces.

Thatrsquos what Irsquom assuming, but I havenrsquot fixed a date, he said of leaving.ldquoItrsquos not easy to leave a job yoursquove been doing for  years. Itrsquos more than half my professional le.ldquoItrsquos not like Irsquom an ambitious youngster with many, many more challenges ahead of me or something like that.ldquoIrsquove always taken the view - and this is the problem in a way - that I would carry on doing it either until they threw me out or had enough of me, or that Irsquod got bored of it or stopped enjoying it.ldquoNone of those things has happened.The BBC, caught on the hop, had no instant response to the story of Mr Humphrysrsquo departure appeared in the press.Only at lunchtime, on Todayrsquos rival, the World at One, did the presenter tell all to his own employers. And he did so to Sarah Montague, his onetime morning co-host.ldquoI genuinely worry about what it is going to be like not doing the Today programme -  years is a very long time, he told her. ldquoI have always enjoyed it, always loved it. And I still do, thatrsquos the problem I should have gone years ago, obviously I should have gone years ago, but I love doing the programme.Gently goaded, he added that he felt he had a relationship with a ldquohuge number of people ...with millions of listeners. That is a huge privilege..Some, however, he admitted, hated his guts. Criticism of Mr Humprhys has mounted over recent years. Many Remainers felt the -year-old did not do enough to interrogate those behind Brexit.The presenter himself - whose decades in the studio came after a meteoric rise from cub reporter, the first on the scene of the Aberfan disaster, to BBC Washington correspondent - has reflected on institutional bias at the Corporation.ldquoWe werenrsquot sufficiently sceptical ndash thatrsquos the most accurate phrase ndash of the pro-European case. We bought into the European ideal, the Today programme interviewer told the Radio Times in ldquoWe didnrsquot look at the potential negatives with sufficient rigour hellip I think wersquore out of that now. I think we have changed.Changed too much, thinks Glasgow-based journalist Peter Geoghegan. ldquoMr Humphrys will rightly be remembered for his pugnacious interviewing of political leaders but recent months have shown the limit of this approach when it comes to tackling complex issues, such as Brexit, ldquo he said.ldquoToo often in recent months, the Today programme has been found wanting on detail and rigour, and Humphrys in particular has repeated erroneous tropes with delving into the detail. Hopefully the time has come for a little less heat and a little more light.Niggles over Brexit did not, however, colour his entire career. ldquoOur listeners will miss him and so will I. Gwyneth Williams, the controller of Radio , said.Mr Humphrys joined Today in  and his departure could trigger a shake-up on the show.Recently Martha Kearney joined the programme, swapping jobs with Sarah Montague, who moved to World At One. Mr Humphrys has railed against the absence of older women on TV. But he is more than aware that his replacement is likely to be female, given the mail dominance of Today.ldquoWe should have another woman on Today, he said back in . ldquoBut then your next question has got to be, so who has to leave ldquoI have no doubt that when I finally keel over or they decide I should be keeled over, a woman will take over from me.In , Mr Humphrys was at the centre of the debate surrounding the gender pay gap at the BBC. His pay was slashed from around pound,-pound, to around pound,-pound,.He said it was his decision to take the cut, telling the Press Association he would ldquolike to think he has given the BBC ldquoreasonable value for money over the years and ldquoIrsquom not exactly on the breadline.Despite his famous grillings and - his critics say - arrogance, Mr Humphrys, who left school at , has suffered from imposter syndrome.

Does the minister agree that his Government needs to change course and instead of robbing pensioners start supporting them \"But Mr Lidington ndash standing in for Mrs May, who was in Belfast holding Brexit talks with the local parties - replied: \"What this House voted for some years ago is perfectly logical and in line with the intention of the benefit system.\"The Nationalist leader insisted the Government was continuing to put its ldquohands into the pockets of the poorest in our society\". Pensioner poverty, he argued, was \"not a myth, it is a reality\" as he called for pension reform to be taken by the Scottish Government in an independent Scotland.However, Mr Lidington pointed out ndash to SNP MPs gesticulating with anger ndash how it was in the power of the Scottish Government under the devolution legislation to ldquotop up social security benefitthey chose to do so.He argued last weekrsquos Scottish Government Budget had \"led to Scots being more highly-taxed than people in any other part of the UK\".The Cabinet Office Minister added: \"The SNP has squandered that Union idend. The message we get from them isyou have an SNP government, Scottish people pay more and get less.\"Later, after further clashes in Points of Order, Mr Blackford declared: ldquoThere is no Union idend. He stressed how the Scottish Government had had a pound billion cut to its Budget over the last nine years.When it was pointed out how ahead of the Scottish Budget, Edinburgh received a pound million windfall thanks to consequentials under the Barnett Formula, the SNP leader referred to it as an ldquoequalisation payment, which was not the same as a Union idend.During a session of Holyroodrsquos Finance Committee, Murdo Fraser, the Conservative MSP, accused Derek Mackay, the Scottish Finance Secretary, of being ldquoessentially dishonest about his Budget, which was passed after a deal between the SNP Government and the Greens.The agreement included an allocation of poundm to local government funded by the additional poundm from Whitehall in Barnett consequentials.But Mr Mackay insisted he had been transparent throughout the process."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-younger-generation-deserve-better-than-brexit","story":"Like John Milne , I value my European identity immensely and appreciate the fact that the SNP continues to stand up for Scotlandrsquos choice to reject the xenophobic, isolationist option chosen by those misguided souls south of the Border.

I happen to believe that our broad-minded and geographically unrestricted younger generation deserve a better future than the one currently bequeathed to them by those who seem unable to extract themselves from an imperial past.If it does come to leaving, I suspect that it wonrsquot be long until the cynically-misled, exploited Leave voters will turn on those who led the Leave campaign and rejoin the rest of us in order to be, once again, at the heart of European decision-making.Dave Stewart, Blairatholl Avenue, Glasgow.MARTIN Redfern asksNicola Sturgeon is capable of doing ldquowhatrsquos best for the people of Scotland. That is exactly what she is doing. For the last two years she has put Scotlandrsquos constitutional issues to the side and pushed for Scotland and the UK to remain within the customs union and single market. All and any analysis I have read has given that outcome as being in the best economic interests of the UK and Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish Government and Scotlandrsquos Parliament have all been dismissed with contempt.The May Government is only interested in the Tory party and the DUP. The EU has proved extremely flexible in dealing with Mmember territories in or out of the EU, so it was possible Scotland and Northern Ireland could have had a dferent status to England Wales but was never asked. Indeed it has been reported that London insisted to the EU that Scotland be denied sharing in any dferentiation on offer to others.Mr Redfern advocates for what he calls the ldquoMay compromise: trouble is that Theresa May changes the parameters of her deal on a daily basis. Donrsquot believe me ndash ask her own Tory MPs. It is the Tories who have led us to this clf edge, and it will be the Tories who tip us into the abyss. Scotland voted to stay in the EU but has zero status or leverage within the UK ldquoUnion. Ireland is respected and her interests are being protected in the EU Union. The dference is stark and should be an example to any Scot with an ounce of gumption.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ROBIN Gilmourdraws a somewhat simplistic comparison between Irelands long struggle for freedom from British rule and the UKs vote to leave the European Union.He is correct to state that the Republic of Ireland, over hundreds of years, fought against domination by Britain and eventually won its independence. However, Britains partition of Ireland, designed to keep the bulk of the Unionist population and heavy industry under the UK flag, sowed the seeds for future conflict in the north of Ireland.Our present vexatious issue with the Irish protocol has only arisen because the UKs decision to depart from the EU leaves Northern Ireland as, obviously, thanks to the partition of , the only part of the UK that shares a border with an EU country.The Irish Government and the EU are trying to work together with Theresa May and her Government to avoid future loss of le and conflict in Northern Ireland by ensuring that there is no hard border, now, and in the future.The only obstruction to Britain arriving at a solution at present appears to be from those who see the people on the island of Ireland as an irrelevance and a hindrance to a clean break with Brussels,despite  per cent of people in Northern Ireland voting to remain.Mr Gilmours exasperation displays an age-old condescending British attitude towards the Irish that I had hoped had evaporated into the mists of history.

as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

It was due to start its final phase of construction this year but it was axed from the councilrsquos capital programme in last yearrsquos budget.Then in March, funding for transport improvements in Dingwall was found to enable some housing development to take place prior to the commencement of the KLR.A transport study and modelling work considered the impact of ious levels of development in the town and improvements will include work at the Bridgend Avenue Junction and Docharty Road Junction as well as traffic signal works at Mart Road Junction. Proposals for walking and cycling improvements and traffic management measures will also be brought forward to enhance active travel facilities in the town.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Graham Mackenzie said: ldquoIt would be tempting to see it as a good news story for Dingwall. That is not the case.

If Dingwall is to grow and provide the range of housing which is required, the KLR must be moved up the list of priorities. This project needs to be reinstated.Fellow ward councillor Angela Maclean insisted the deal was good news. She said: ldquoWe as councillors have a leadership role and it is up to us to be helping our communities to move forward and this report has examples of when officers have looked for solutions to get round some of the fact that we donrsquot have all the money we would like.\"Whether it is through the infrastructure road plans or capital fund we are going to try and move forward with these houses in Dingwall, because Dingwall is a pressurised area ndash this is a positive move because we donrsquot have enough houses in Dingwall.Thursday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them. In some cases, depending on their set-up, it turns out after a thorough analysis that there are few specic risks.However, the process has been useful as a prompt to look at their operations in detail to see where there could get more general business efficiencies and opportunities. That may be the one silver lining to emerge from the Brexit process, whether there are any more remains to be seen.Stuart Murdoch is a solicitor advocate and partner at Burness Paull LLP©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4868785.1549464609!/image/image.jpg","title":"mike russell scotland facing deep recession under no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A No deal Brexit could plunge Scotlands economy into a \"deep recession\" with widespread job losses and firms leaving the country, Brexit Secretary Mike Russell has warned.Scots could also face food price hikes of -% with rural areas of the country facing particular issues, he told MSPs at Holyrood.The cabinet Secretary spoke out as the likelihood of a No deal scenario looks increasingly likely, with Prime Minister Theresa May struggling to salvage her much-maligned Withdrawal Deal after its Commons rejection.Read more: Donald Tusk: ‘A special place in hell’ exists for Brexit backersThe Scottish Government has been \"steadily intensying\" its preparations for a No deal in the early months of the year, Mr Russell revealed today.He warned: \"A No-Deal Brexit has the potential to generate a signicant economic shock which could tip the Scottish economy into recession -

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes. Andthis is why communities across the Northern Ireland have formed these community first responder schemes.Volunteers are trained, and dispatched at the same time as the responding ambulance crew, by NIAS.The Braid Valley is now joining this movement.Leonard Wharry, the scheme coordinator, explained: We aim to go live in early summer with a scheme covering Ballymena, Broughshane and the surrounding rural areas.Were raising money for defibrillators and other equipment, but our priority is to recruit and train volunteers.

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"mcdaid double ends stars cup hopes","story":"Irish Cup Sixth RoundLarne Crumlin Star A SECOND half brace from David McDaid crushed Crumlin Star#s dreams of a place in the last eight of the Irish Cup as runaway Championship One leaders, Larne fought back from a goal down to claim the win at a sunny and cold Inver Park on Saturday.The Ardoyne side dared to dream when Joe McNeill put them into the lead on  minutes, but the hosts drew level on  thanks to a Jeff Hughes header and after the break, they went ahead when McDaid converted what looked a harshly awarded penalty after Hughes# shot hit the arm of Ciaran Hughes and the ex-Cltonville striker make sure of victory with a late goal.Star were far from disgraced in this game and their large support could be proud of their team#s efforts on the day as they put it up to the Premiership-bound opposition who were laden with players who have played at the top level including former Reds in McDaid, Martin Donnelly, Tomás Cosgrove and Conor Devlin.In front of a big crowd that added to the occasion, the visitors opened with confidence and two minutes in, Devlin had to get down to his right to claw Barry McKervey#s free-kick around the post for a corner that led to a shot from Mark Lyons flying wide right.Larne gradually got to grips with the early pressure and looked to move the ball quickly in order to find gaps in the Star defence.Their first chance fell to McDaid who didn#t get hold of his shot and it was easily saved by Shane Harrison.On nine minutes, Martin Donnelly weaved his way past a number of challenges from the right and found himself just yards out, but he elected to place his shot rather than put power behind it with the goal at his mercy and Harrison was able to get down to stop it and get his behind for a corner that was aimed at the back post, but McDaid headed just too high.Star remained a threat and were always looking to create an opening # something they did to perfection on  minutes when brothers, Aidan and Joe McNeill combined to perfection with Aidan playing a perfectly-weighted ball in behind the Larne defence with Joe beating Devlin to the ball and lted it over the goalkeeper and into the net to send the away support into raptures.The pressure was now on Larne and they bombarded Star in search for the equaliser.Patrick McNally # a replacement for the injured Shane McEleney # headed over from Tomás Cosgrove#s shot and Cosgrove then saw his shot at the near post saved.The hosts were getting closer and on  minutes, the goal came when Hughes rose to meet Donnelly#s corner from the right and thundered a header high into the net.The momentum was with Larne and Donnelly then saw his brilliant free-kick saved onto the post and cleared by Harrison, while on the stroke of half-time, Cosgrove#s curling effort from the edge of the box went just outside the post with the goalkeeper beaten.With the sides level at the break, it was all to play for and both tried to establish themselves early in the second period.Chances were thin on the ground with Larne#s Jeff Hughes hooking a th minute effort well off target, but they really should have gone ahead on  minutes when Cosgrove cut in on the left and rolled a good ball across the face of goal to McNally a couple of yards from goal, but he inexplicably lted the ball over when it looked much easier to score.Larne did get their noses in front on  minutes from McDaid#s penalty, but Star certainly felt the award was hard as Hughes# shot at goal seemed to just hit the arm of Burns who had no time to get out of the way, but a spot-kick was the decision of referee Shane Andrews and McDaid made no mistake, firing high into the net.Star now needed a goal, but they were unable to carve out any clear chances with Larne looking to put the game away and Martin Donnelly had a couple of chances, but couldn#t find the goal his performance deserved.Instead, it was left to McDaid who swept home in the final minute from Lee Lynch#s cross from the right to seal his side#s passage into the quarter-final.LARNE: C Devlin, C Ramsey, T Cosgrove, J Hughes, L Lynch, S McEleney , F Sule, G Kelly, B Tiney , M Donnelly , D McDaid.

He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

We believe that in attempting to coerce the north of Ireland out of the European Union against the democratically expressed wishes of the people, that the concept of consent has been damaged.“We also know from polling data north and south that public sentiment is of a view that in the event of a crash Brexit, that people’s preference would be for Irish unity.“The only way that anyone can act in a democratic fashion is to respect consent, to respect the democratic wishes of the people of the north of Ireland and to use the Good Friday Agreement, its provisions, to guide us in the time ahead.“Sothere is a Tory crash, and Mrs May has conceded as much on the floor of the House of Commons, in that event, not alone will there be pressure for a referendum on Irish unity, there will be absolute democratic imperative to call such a referendum.”When pressed over how Mrs May had responded to this during their meeting, Mrs McDonald said that neither the Prime Minister or Secretary of State Karen Bradley committed to saying when oran Irish unity poll would be called.She said: “But that is the secondary consideration, the primary issue here is the concept of consent which is hardwired into the Good Friday Agreement, the fact that the people of the north of Ireland have not consented to Brexit, the fact that business, farmers, academia, community sector, trade unions and political system almost unanimously regard Brexit as damaging and negative, almost unanimously regard the backstop as the absolutely bare minimum and the bottom line.“The exception to that consensus is the DUP, the DUP cannot rule the roost on these matters, actually the people need to be in the driving seat, just as they voted against Brexit, in the event of a crash, I think the democratically correct thing to do, the compliant thing to do as regards the Good Friday Agreement, is toto the people again, and in a structured way, to allow for the debate for the conversation for the transition and to put the question on Irish unity.“Mrs May is a Unionist, she takes a dferent view.”The Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters in Westminster: “The conditions for a border poll are set out in the Belfast Agreement.“It remains the Northern Ireland Secretary’s view that the majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support the current political settlement and that the circumstances requiring a border poll are not satisfied.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charles to meet members of the spice girls at princes trust event","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brussels for crunch Brexit talks insisting that the UK must not be “trapped” in a backstop deal..pushThe Prime Minister is meeting EU leaders on Thursday in the wake of the latest war of words between the two sides.The spat was triggered by European Council president Donald Tusk saying there was a “special place in hell” for those who pushed for Brexit without a plan.Mrs May’s latest diplomatic offensive comes as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to the PM setting out five demands, including joining a customs union, that would need to be met for Labour to back the Government on Brexit.The PM will use the top level Brussels talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Mr Tusk and other prominent EU figures to press for legally binding guarantees on the Northern Ireland backstop.At present the backstop, which is intended to prevent theof a hard border in Ireland, would see the UK continue to obey EU customs rules after a transition periodno wider trade deal had been reached.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council Donald Tusk Downing Street said that Mrs May is “open to dferent ways” of achieving her objectives on the backstop.The PM will use the meetings to state that Parliament has sent “an unequivocal message that change is required”.One of the PM’s key messages for EU leaders will be that the Commons has now made it clear it could support the Withdrawal Agreement as long as concerns about the backstop are addressed.Mrs May also intends to stress that Labour leader Mr Corbyn also has concerns about the backstop, so it is not just an issue for the Tories and their DUP allies.In Mr Corbyn’s letter to the PM, which follows their Brexit meeting last week, he insists that Labour’s Brexit demands must be enshrined in the Political Declaration setting out future relations with the EU.Mr Corbyn said that securing in law the demands is the only way of achieving Labour support and uniting the country.He calls for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union” that gives the UK a say over future trade deals, and close alignment with the single market, underpinned by “shared institutions”.Mr Corbyn also calls for “dynamic alignment on rights and protections” in order that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU, as well as commitments on participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, and “unambiguous agreements on the detail of future security arrangements, including access to the European Arrest Warrant and vital shared databases”.The letter drew criticism from some pro-EU Labour figures who said it went against Labour’s Brexit stance.Among the prominent EU figures Mrs May is set to meet is European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt who joined in with Mr Tusk’s Brexit “hell” analogy.Mr Verhofstadt tweeted that Lucer would not welcome such Brexiteers because “after what they did to Britain they would even manage to ide Hell”.Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Mrs May is seeking to delay another Commons “meaningful vote” on the Government’s Brexit stance until the end of February – just a month before the UK is scheduled to quit the EU on March

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths.

His nearest runner-up was Rev David Bruce, with four votes.He said he is “evangelical” when asked where he would be on the liberal-traditionalist spectrum.He had also stood as moderator last year.Hailing from Mallusk on the north-west edge of Newtownabbey, Rev Henry has a chemistry degree but eschewed a science career to pursue the Gospel.In the roughly  years he has been minister in Maze Presbyterian Church, west of Lisburn, it has grown from about  Sunday worshippers to about .At age  now, he will be one of the youngest moderators in history.However, from - a man called Rev Dr Gilbert Patton MC served in the role, at age .Rev Henry lives in Lisburn, is married to Nora, and has three children – Bethany , Megan , and Connor .Here are his views on a few topics he was quizzed about:• Brexit:“We’re an all-Ireland church [with an] all-island perspective. We’d be wanting to make sure there is something workable on both sides, in both jurisdictions...Teenage murder accused ‘under threat’ from other inmatesHusband and we jailed over child cruelty and sexual abuse Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I’m not going to try and pretend I’ve an answer to the technicalities our politicians are needing to work through just now. If I’d an answer to that, Theresa May wouldn’t be up at Stormont – she’d be here listening to me.“But certainly what I can do is I can encourage people to pray for a solution – because we need a solution, something that gives a degree of certainty for our people...“There are of course deep feelings around the backstop, but I think as a church we’ve a responsibility to pray. So we’ll be praying for Mrs May, praying for Mr Varadkar, praying for the EU officials – particularly as there are discussions going on today and tomorrow there’d be a resolution that can get that broad consensus and bring real change.”Asked by the News Letter whether he was a Remainer or a Leaver, he would not answer – with Presbyterian clerk Trevor Gribben chipping in to say “probably none of you as journalists would tell us what way you voted, either!”He said it was “immaterial” how he voted, and pressed by the BBC on whether he would ever reveal his Brexit stance, he said: “I wouldn’t think so!”• Homosexuality:Last year the General Assembly adopted a position that children of people in gay relationships would not be baptised, sparking criticism from more liberal quarters.“There are very few within our denomination that could disagree this has been a dficult year for our church. It has been deeply challenging,” said Rev Henry.“Our present moderator Dr McMullan and others have expressed that sense of hurt many people will have experienced because of the decisions of our last General Assembly.“We’ve a recognition that our denomination is a family. And sometimes when any family gets together there’ll be those fallouts, as it were. Maybe ‘fallouts’ is a bit extreme, but certainly a dference of opinion.“We’ll be stressing of course that everyone is valued. Everyone is loved by God.“We as a church would reject all aspects of homophobia – that’s clearly wrong in every situation.”He went on to say thatgay marriage is legalised, “we’d accept that”, albeit “with a degree of sadness”.However “it would not change the position of our church” – namely, thata Biblical perspective on marriage is exclusively between one man and one woman.• Women moderators: Rev Henry was asked at one point by the BBC: “Another year goes by and still no woman moderator – what is going on within the church ”He said “realistically I do think it’s only a matter of time”.Women have been elders since the s and ministers since .Currently about .% of the church’s ministers, both retired and active, are women. Of the active ones, about % are women.He does not believe there was any “anti-woman vote going on,” noting that a woman, Rev Mairisine Stanfield, was among the contenders in Tuesday’s gathering, garnering three votes.“Even Mairisine I don’t think would necessarily see herself as a woman minister. She’s a minister who happens to be a woman.”• Union Theological College:The Presbyterian-run college has long been part of the Institute of Theology at Queen’s University Belfast, but the university recently suspended enrolment of undergraduates for   after a review which voiced concerns over the “breadth and ersity of the teaching”.“I’m certainly disappointed with the decision, because what that does is it denies some of our young people the choice to follow their dream, and to study theology at the highest academic level...“My middle daughter had an th birthday just recently. Even at a relatively small gathering in our house... in that one social gathering, there were three -year-olds who wanted to apply to study theology at Queen’s this year and that’s been denied.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

This is about people being able to do their jobs, it’s about workforce planning in our health service, in our schools, it’s about all of those things. It’s not about philosophical debates in Parliament.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who was third in to see Mrs May, said she needed to understand there was “no alternative” to the backstop.“The bottom line is this – for the people of Northern Ireland, for our peace process, for all of our political progress, we need to remain within the customs union and single market in order to avoid a hard border,” he said.‘Hell is too good for them,’ NI academic says of no-deal BrexiteersDamages case could open door to hundreds of secondary Troubles victim claims Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I think that will begin to be understood at all levels in the British parliament because they don’t have an alternative. They talk about vague alternatives but there aren’t any alternatives.”Following her discussions with the PM, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald accused Mrs May of coming to Belfast with “no plan, no credibility and no honour”.She added: “We regard the position adopted by Mrs May and her government as one of hostility to Irish interests, we have told her that Irish public and political opinion is united on the matter of protecting Ireland north and south, and we have told her that certainly we will not blink.”Mrs May’s partners in government, the DUP, were the final party to meet the PM at Stormont House.Speaking afterwards, DUP leader Arlene Foster reiterated her position that the backstop is the “main problem”.She said her party has an “ongoing engagement” with the government over Brexit.“This was another useful opportunity to press for a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom. We want a deal which respects the Union and the referendum result,” she said.“Our message was very simple. The draft Withdrawal Agreement is flawed because the backstop would undermine the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. “The backstop is the main problem. It must be dealt with in the terms set out in the Brady Amendment which secured a majority in the House of Commons.“During that debate, the prime minister made commitments that there would be legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. That is what is needed.“It is welcome that the prime minister is travelling to Brussels to seek changes but she must stand strong and by the commitments she made.”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

We have already set forth, set out within Westminster, ways in which we believe as a UK government we would deliver on that.“I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about regulatory dferences but as I say, we were absolutely clear in that December joint report, and we retain our absolute commitment to that, to ensure Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market.”Ken Reid of UTV asked:“Fty six per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, it has wide support in the business community here as well. How are you going to persuade particularly nationalist politicians, the nationalist parties, to accept a deal that doesn’t contain a backstop ”Mrs May replied: “Well I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy.

The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
