(Nicola Frega)Cristiano Ronaldo interrupted a post-match interview to hug Gianluigi Buffon after the Juventus goalkeeper was sent off against Real Madrid on Wednesday evening.After losing 3-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final, Juventus scored three times at the Santiago Bernabeu to set up a tense finish.As the match appeared to be heading for extra time, referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty for Mehdi Benatia’s foul on Lucas Vazquez.Juventus’ players protested the decision for several minutes and a furious Buffon was sent off for his angry reaction towards Oliver.Buffon was sent off for protesting to referee Michael Oliver. (AFPGetty Images)Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up to convert the penalty, which has sealed Madrid’s place in Friday’s semi-final draw.For Buffon, the match could represent his final appearance in the Champions League, although the 40-year-old has not revealed his decision over his future.After the match, Buffon insulted Oliver in his post-match interview, claiming that the Premier League official ‘has a garbage bin where his heart should be’.Ronaldo, meanwhile, insisted that Oliver was right to award a penalty.And in a special moment as the players were leaving the Santiago Bernabeu, Ronaldo interrupted Buffon, who was speaking to the media, to hug the Juventus goalkeeper and say some kind words to him.‘I have a lot of respect for Buffon, the words he has said about me, and what I’ve said about him,’ Ronaldo told RTP after the match.‘He is a great goalkeeper and I hope this is not his last Champions League appearance, he is one of the best goalkeepers ever.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7008469.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"get 600000 four bedroom house 5 thanks raffle fund dementia research","story":"(Picture: SWNS)Feeling a little glum about the current state of the housing market?Same. We’ve pretty much accepted that we’re doomed to rent forever.But rather than throwing £800 a month at the problem, there could be another solution to your property-related woes… if you’re lucky.A couple are raffling off their stunning £600,000 four-bedroom property for just £5 a ticket.As well as covering the cost of the home, Marty Pumbien and Annie Brown hope the raffle will raise money for research into dementia.The house is pretty snazzy, coming in at 2,500 square feet of living space and sitting on Abington Park Crescent in Northampton, right next to a large park.(Picture: SWNS)There are four double bedrooms, – three of which have en suite bathrooms – a state of the art kitchen, three reception rooms, a study, a utility room, and a back garden.It’s the little details that count: Exposed brick fireplaces, heated floors, and a whirlpool spa bath and waterfall shower in the main bathroom. Dreamy.The raffle is now open to entries, and the winner will be announced on 14 October. If you fancy trying your luck with a £5 ticket, you can buy a try on the home’s website.(Picture: SWNS)You’ll need to answer a question about Northampton correctly to be in with a chance of winning. Oh, and you can enter as many times as you want.‘It all sounds a bit mad but when you think about it, it’s a bit loopy but it’s a chance to make a difference,’ says Marty.‘It’s an idea we had a couple of years ago and I was chatting to the missus about it and she gave me a slap and told me not to be so stupid and move on.(Picture: SWNS)‘But I started looking at doing some proper investigation work into it and eventually she came around to the idea.‘It is quite a minefield legally, the terms and conditions, getting round the legalities of the gambling, all that kind of stuff – it’s been a bit of a headache but we got there in the end.‘We’re both nurses and we have 40 years of experience between us of A\u0026ampE and we see dementia patents all the time.(Picture: SWNS)‘The lack of support and facilities for them is scary really, especially in A\u0026ampE where the conditions are worse.‘I see it in the community a lot as well now – if they have mild dementia they can live on their own and have a bit of help but they’re locked in their own homes.‘We sorted out the legalities, got talking to the university through our solicitors about their scheme and what they’re looking to do – they have loads of ideas but a lack of funding.(Picture: SWNS)‘We are used to helping people on a day-to-day and one-by-one basis, doing it this way we can actually help an entire community in one go.’The couple hope to sell 500,000 tickets, which will generate £2.5million if all of the tickets are bought. They’ll give £1million to the dementia research fund run by the University of Northampton, and the Northamptonshire Community Foundation will match the funds.(Picture: SWNS)The couple will take £800,000 to cover the cost of the house and the fees associated with selling it.Marty said: ‘It is a massive house and there’s only me, the missus and a small dog.‘We refurbished it – it was all intended for children but it turns out we can’t have children.‘A lot of the house for us has become redundant, it needs a family – four double beds, three en-suites, walk-in showers, whirl baths, the whole kit and caboodle.(Picture: SWNS)‘The whole top floor, we never go up there – the two double beds on the top floor with en-suites, we never go up there.‘It’s not so much about why should you buy a ticket, but rather why not?‘We used to live in Manchester so we’re contemplating going there next.’MORE: Homelessness and mental health: what’s being done to help?MORE: Is this beauty membership club the new alternative to subscription boxes?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/97614936.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"i had a little nap on top of him mid coitus what its like to date when you have narcolepsy","story":"You’re more likely to just find us extremely groggy and a bit incoherent than completely passed out (Picture: Getty)A friend recently introduced me to a film called Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo.The scene that stuck out to me, though, was when Deuce takes a girl with narcolepsy on a date.This character blithely warns Deuce that she has a sleep disorder then promptly at random intervals keels over and starts snoring.I mean, it took a lot to not shout at the screen.As a Person With Narcolepsy (PWN) myself this is actually one of the myths that I come across daily, and there’s no area more awkward for it to than dating.For those of you who haven’t heard of narcolepsy before, it’s a neurological sleep disorder which, among other things, causes the sufferer to experience excessive daytime sleepiness, meaning we may fall asleep in really inappropriate places.Buses standing up, meetings, in a friend’s bath when I was meant to be cat sitting are all venues I’ve had an unwilling nap.Narcolepsy can be a really debilitating illness that interrupts nearly all sufferers’ lives to quite a degree.But what happens when you’re in your mid-twenties and you throw dating into the mix? A whole lot of awkwardness, let me tell you.First of all, let’s get one thing clear, we are not like the girl in Deuce Bigalow.Far from keeling over, most PWN fight the urge to sleep when it arises so you’re more likely to just find us extremely groggy and a bit incoherent.If the urge ever overwhelms us you’ll probably find us quietly slumped somewhere, as most of us get some warning before the sleepiness takes over.This doesn’t mean dating isn’t a minefield. For starters, try holding a conversation after eight hours at work when your brain is technically seven days’ sleep deprived.One fun symptom I experience is being able to half dream when I’m awake as I’m slowly starting to drift off and this leads me to say all sorts of weird stuff.Last summer I went on a date with a lovely guy to a pub. It was 28C (82F), and already a slumber-inducing warmth had blanketed the whole city.We were holed up on a sunny afternoon in the corner of an old pub. As he was talking I could feel myself succumbing to the lazy heat of the day and in that moment where I was both asleep and awake I dreamt that I was sat in a bowl of soup because the atmosphere in the pub was so warm and close.I ponder this then pipe up: ‘Wow, it’s really soupy in here.’ As the words leave my mouth I jolt awake to a look of utter confusion from my poor date.Lesson one: telling someone the room is like a starter food type is not winning conversation.A question that also pops up whenever I mention my narcolepsy in social situations, inevitably asked by men usually, is do I fall asleep during sex.I don’t tend to answer this on the basis that it’s none of anybody’s business, but my ex, who I’m still very close to, loves to wheel this out as his narcolepsy story.We’ll be casually sharing drinks with friends in a beer garden somewhere and he’ll throw in the time I was so exhausted from college then going to a gig back in Nottingham that I, er, well, had a little nap on top of him mid-coitus.I’d like to stress this is a rare scenario that was exacerbated by studying for my final major project. Nevertheless, it did happen.I was reminded of this more recently when staying at a new partner’s house.We’d done the will-they-won’t-they dance for month or so and finally we’d kissed and were going home. It had been a long day, and he lived on the opposite end of the city to me.Despite this we were still embroiled in the excitement of finally kissing, but as we entered his house I suddenly felt the familiar lead blanket of sleepiness come over me.I wasn’t really sure what to do – I didn’t feel I knew him well enough yet to say: ‘Let me have a nap for 30 minutes then I’ll be human again.’We lay on his bed and I gave him a head massage. I’ve often strangely been credited on the soothing quality of my head massages so my thought process was: ‘If you nap, I nap’.Low and behold, after five minutes of soothing scalp scratching he drifted off, and so did I, within seconds. Another slightly anticlimactic end to a date.Sometimes getting the other person to nap is the best option (Illustration: Liberty Antonia Sadler for usBut it’s not all been bad – sometimes the condition can actually come in handy.I always strongly opposed ever using my illness as an ‘excuse’ for any dating failures.But when I started using Tinder I quickly realised that there’s a significant amount of catfishing which goes on and began to rethink my stance.After matching with a guy who looked right up my street, I sat in a local cafe waiting to meet him, only to be greeted by someone who looked like his second cousin once removed. At best.This could be OK, I thought. He may be into everything I’m into and have great chat. It became apparent this was not the case about 20 minutes in.Now, I’m ashamed to this day about what happened next, but halfway into the date I really didn’t know what to do.My adult self told me to be honest, polite and leave. My teenage self was shouting ‘but that will crush him – lie!’Yes, I felt like an arsehole, until he tried to chase me to the bus stop and kiss me. Then I deleted Tinder.There are some s***ty parts of dating with narcolepsy – people can be intolerant of how tired you are and frustrated when you can’t do everything they can.But there are also from amusing anecdotes to be had from it, and I’m all about silver linings.One thing to remember is when you find someone who’s worth your time and company they will be respectful and supportive of your illness, and I know those people do exist because I was with one for seven years, even if he does sometimes bust out the sleep sex story.MORE: Bite guards, bedtime rituals and cutting out the caffeine: How I manage my narcolepsyMORE: Have you experienced sleep paralysis?

For about a year my eyes were constantly red and itchy.‘My pupils, they can’t adjust to light anymore so I’m very photosensitive now too.‘This surgery completely f***ed up my life.Nadinne after the surgery (Picture: SWNS)‘In September I was forced to go to hospital in Miami where the doctors said they had to remove the implants to save my sight because of chronic inflammation.‘In November I had emergency glaucoma surgery in both eyes.‘My vision damage is permanent, and I still have to have a cornea transplant and I have cataracts too.’Nadinne said the surgery impacted her career as she was unable to participate in photo shoots for her Instagram page, because of the appearance of her eyes.‘My sister became like my mom. She had to do everything for me,’ she said.‘After this surgery I went into a deep depression. I’m a very strong person, usually very brave and very smart, but with this I was completely stupid. I trusted the wrong person.‘Now I have the vision of a 90-year-old lady right but I’m hoping I can just keep my glaucoma under control.’‘Mrs. Bruna was our patient. However, I do not know any type of treatments that have been carried out on later dates and the results or diagnoses of them.‘I can not comment andor disclose information about patients’ cases or medical records.’She will have eye problems for the rest of her life (Picture: SWNS)Nadinne has not taken legal action against Dr Carbera’s practice as she said she isn’t in the financial position to do so.The model said: ‘It’s crazy, because even though I’ve been open about this surgery on Instagram, people are still are asking me where they can do it.‘But I don’t think surgeries are bad. I just didn’t know the risks and I made a mistake by not doing my research.‘Next month I’m going to have a surgery to reduce my boobs because I’ve lost a lot of weight this year and it’s something I have to do.’Dr Ranya Habash, Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology in Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, said procedures like the one Nadinne opted for cause ‘irreparable’ damage to the eyes.She said: ‘The issue with injecting a silicone plate into the eye is that it clogs the drain of the eye, just like as if a sink was blocked.‘The pressure builds and builds inside the eye, causing inflammation and damaging the structures.‘There’s a reason these procedures are not FDA approved and that’s because we’ve seen the long-term and irreparable damage they can cause.‘Nadinne’s eye problems are something she will have to deal with for the rest of her life.

Debbie Dingell (left) pointed out how many things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (right) didn\u0027t seem to know about his own website           Rep. Ben Ray Luján told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he didn\u0027t like how non-users would have to sign up for a Facebook page in order to see what the social network had scooped up about them Luján took issue with the practice because non-users currently had to sign up for Facebook if they wanted to see what data of theirs the social network collected. \u0027You\u0027ve said everyone controls their data, by you\u0027re collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement,\u0027 Luján said, encouraging Zuckerberg to fix the problem. During the five-hour hearing, the Facebook CEO revealed that his own personal data had been included when 87 million or so Facebook users had their data improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered when asked by Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, whether his data was included in the data sold to malicious third parties. \u0027Your personal data?\u0027 Eshoo clarified.  But he pushed back on  suggestions from the members of the House of Representatives that users do not have enough control of their data on Facebook in the wake of the privacy scandal at the world\u0027s largest social media network.\u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 he said.\u0027Not buried in the settings somewhere but right there,\u0027 the 33-year-old internet magnate told the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.          Push back: \u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 Zuckerberg said to the House Energy and Commerce Committee    Facebook CEO is swarmed by photographers as he arrives to testify before House members on Wednesday            No boost for Zuck: The Facebook CEO was back in a regular chair after he got an extra cushion on Tuesday when he appeared in front of the Senate joint committee  The way he was: How Zuckerberg got a boost as he testified to the Senate joint committee on Tuesday           In one of the odder moments of the day, Rep. Michael Burgess made a point to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) using a Dilbert cartoon about \u0027terms and conditions\u0027           Rep. Michael Burgess also shared the cartoon on Twitter explaining that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data\u0027 Once again wearing a dark suit instead of his usual gray T-shirt, the hearing was Zuckerberg\u0027s second in two days. CONGRESSMAN BRINGS DILBERT CARTOON TO FACEBOOK HEARING Beyond Cambridge Analytica, lawmakers asked questions Wednesday about Facebook\u0027s terms of use, and if the social network censored certain types of political speech.  Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, brought along with him a vintage Dilbert cartoon to make a point about Facebook\u0027s \u0027terms and conditions.\u0027  \u0027I consulted my technology consultant Scott Adams, in the form of Dilbert,\u0027 Burgess said. The cartoon strip shows Dilbert telling Dogbert, \u0027I didn\u0027t read all of my shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it. Apparently I agreed to spend the rest as a towel boy in Bill Gates\u0027 new mansion.\u0027  \u0027Call your lawyer,\u0027 recommends the small white cartoon dog.  \u0027Too late, he opened software yesterday. Now he\u0027s Bill\u0027s laundry boy,\u0027 Dilbert responded, referencing Microsoft\u0027s CEO. Burgess\u0027 broader point, which he articulated in a tweet, is that too few Americans read the \u0027terms and conditions,\u0027 adding that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data.\u0027 ZUCKERBERG ASKED ABOUT FACEBOOK PREDECESSOR \u0027FACEMASH\u0027  Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, deployed an interesting line of questioning, asking Zuckerberg about the origins of \u0027Facemash\u0027 and if it was still up and running. \u0027No, congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,\u0027 Zuckerberg replied. \u0027There was a movie about this, it says it was about this, of unclear truth, and the claim that Facemash was somehow connected to the development of Facebook, it isn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 the CEO continued, referencing the 2010 movie, \u0027The Social Network.\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that he created that website in 2003. \u0027It actually has nothing do to with Facebook,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you put up pictures of women and decide which one was the better, the more attractive of the two, is that right?\u0027 Long asked. Zuckerberg said that was right. \u0027Congressman, that is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was sophomore in college,\u0027 the CEO said, as Long made comments about the website\u0027s beginnings.           After asking about Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s \u0027Facemash\u0027 website, Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, brought up perceived bias against Trump-supporting sisters, Diamond and Silk          Rep. Billy Long even went as far as to have an aide hold up a picture of the two women and asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who they were. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 the 33-year-old CEO answered LAWMAKERS FIXATE ON DIAMOND AND SILK CONTROVERSYLong then asked staff to hold up a large photograph and asked Zuckerberg to describe who was pictured. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 Zuckerberg asked. Long said it was. \u0027That is Diamond and Silk, two biological sisters from North Carolina, I might point out they\u0027re African-American, and their content was deemed by your folks to be unsafe,\u0027 Long said. \u0027Diamond and Silk have a question for you. And that question is, What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\u0027 he continued. A number of Republican lawmakers asked Zuckerberg questions about the Trump-supporting sisters over his two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. \u0027Well Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\u0027 Zuckerberg answered.  Facebook acknowledged sending a message to the sisters, prominent conservative video bloggers, deeming their content \u0027unsafe,\u0027 but the social network said the contents of the message were \u0027inaccurate.\u0027 \u0027We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,\u0027 Facebook\u0027s spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said. In front of lawmakers, Zuckerberg was caught flat-footed, as the Diamond and Silk situation had developed over the past several days. \u0027The specifics of this situation I am not as up to speed on as I would be,\u0027 Zuckerberg told Long.   Other Republicans brought up the Diamond and Silk incident to ask the Facebook co-founder questions about political bias. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, deployed that line of questioning on Tuesday.  \u0027There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\u0027 Cruz said. \u0027There have been numerous instances with Facebook.\u0027  Rep. Joe Barton, another Texas Republican, held up his phone and told Zuckerberg he was going to ask him a question that someone had submitted to the congressman\u0027s Facebook account. \u0027First question: Please ask Mr. Zuckerberg, why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them unsafe to the community. That is absurd. They hold conservative views. That isn\u0027t unsafe,\u0027 Barton said reading the question, and adding his own, \u0027What\u0027s your response?\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that his team had made \u0027an enforcement error.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027ve already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,\u0027 he said, referring to Diamond and Silk. Later on in the hearing Wednesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican running for Senate, asked whether free speech is being censored by the site.Zuckerberg used the example of terrorism, as the types of posts that would be pulled from Facebook. \u0027Let me tell you right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism,\u0027 Blackburn scoffed.  WALL STREET INVESTORS LOVE ZUCK On Tuesday, Zuckerberg took questions for nearly five hours in a Senate hearing without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business, foiling attempts by senators to pin him down. Investors were impressed with his initial performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years on Tuesday, closing up 4.5 percent. They were down 0.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday Zuckerberg\u0027s testimony further bolstered investors\u0027 views of the company, with the CEO\u0027s performance leading them to believe that the company would weather the storm surrounding Cambridge Analytica.   Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u0027 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted President Trump\u0027s election campaign among its clients.Zuckerberg faced broad concerns from members of Congress about how Facebook shares user data.          A number of lawmakers have complained over Facebook\u0027s treatment of Diamond and Silk, prominent Trump supporters, which the company has said it\u0027s remedying  Lawmaker turns on Zuckerberg telling him \u0027as CEO you didn\u0027t...Dow Jones drops 200 points as markets get jittery over...Zuckerberg warns of ¿arms race¿ with Russian trolls who will...Facebook launches \u0027bug bounty\u0027 program offering up to...Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are sued by British and US...Zuckerberg is quizzed repeatedly on perceived left-wing bias...Share this article    Back in the hot seat: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned Wednesday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee after a joint committee of the Senate had questioned him on Tuesday\u0027How can consumers have control over their data when Facebook does not have control over the data?\u0027 asked Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce committee.The latest estimate of affected users is up to 87 million.Patience with the social network had already worn thin among users, advertisers and investors after the company said last year that Russia used Facebook for years to try to sway U.S. politics, an allegation Moscow denies.Lawmakers have sought assurances that Facebook can effectively police itself, and few came away from Tuesday\u0027s hearing expressing confidence in the social network.\u0027I don\u0027t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God, I will,\u0027 Republican Senator John Kennedy told Zuckerberg on Tuesday. \u0027A lot of that depends on you.\u0027Zuckerberg deflected requests to support specific legislation. Pressed repeatedly by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey to endorse a proposed law that would require companies to get people\u0027s permission before sharing personal information, Zuckerberg agreed to further talks.\u0027In principle, I think that makes sense, and the details matter, and I look forward to having our team work with you on fleshing that out,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.But those qualms didn\u0027t rattle Wall Street as Zuckerberg testified that despite the #DeleteFacebook movement, the number of uses of the website hasn\u0027t gone down significantly.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Man Booker Prize 2018 festival lineup revealed","story":"Jason Aldean returns to Las Vegas for first time since Mandalay Bay shooting for ACM Awards 2018Hug an Australian Day: Everything you need to know What is FaceMash?

Sources told the magazine that Barris is looking to go to Netflix, which recently signed former ABC powerhouse Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure contracts.It may be difficult for Barris to get out of his contract, since he just signed a four-year deal with the network last year. And sources told Variety that the network is not interested in losing one of their top talents. While Rhimes also left early, she only had a year left in her contract and ABC agreed to release her.Barris\u0027 alleged dissatisfaction with the network, where he has worked since 2015, may have to do with executives pulling a \u0027racially-charged\u0027 episode of Black-ish last month, which dealt with the NFL national anthem kneeling protest.

Israel launched a missile strike on the site in September last year. A nearby base storing surface-to-surface missiles was also hit, monitors said.Jamraya Scientific Studies and Research CentreWestern intelligence has claimed this site is one of three used to produce chemical weapons - despite being promoted as a civilian research facility. Barzeh facilityBelieved to specialise in installing chemical weapons on long-range missiles and artillery.

It is thought to be protected by Russia\u0027s fearsome S-300 and S-400 air missile defence systems and has been strategically important for Moscow as its forces prop up Assad\u0027s regime.In December Putin made a surprise visit to the airbase in Latakia where he ordered a partial pullout of the country\u0027s troops, saying their task had been largely completed.

It is positioned to the west of the ancient city of Palmyra.Forces from regime allies Russia and Iran, as well as fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, are known to have a presence at the base. In December 2016, ISIS fanatics attacked the base a day after overrunning pro-government forces in nearby Palmyra. The terrorists claimed to have destroyed four Syrian military aircraft.           Israel carried out strikes against a Syrian government base in the country\u0027s centre in February, with war monitors identifying it at the time as T-4In February this year, Israel\u0027s Air Force launched an attack on the airbase, destroying the main observation tower, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel was accused of launching a bombing raid on the same site on April 9 in the wake of a horrifying chemical attack in Douma.The base was used by the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s for the occasional deployment of naval aircraft. Al Typhur Syrian planes have been evacuated from the Damascus base and positioned closer to Russian forces after the chemical attack in Douma. Al-DumayrBase, 25 miles north east of Damascus, from which Assad\u0027s planes are believed to have launched Saturday\u0027s chemical attack in Douma, according to experts.

All the indications are that the Syrian regime was responsible.‘We will be working with our closest allies on how we can ensure that those who are responsible are held to account and how we can prevent and deter the humanitarian catastrophe that comes from the use of chemical weapons in the future.’Tory MP Mr Lewis insisted there should be a vote before the UK took action. ‘There is a real danger that what starts out as justified punishment for the use of chemical weapons ends up with the Royal Air Force serving as the air arm of the jihadi extremist rebels in Syria,’ he said.‘It sends a very bad signal to the country that they don’t submit themselves to parliamentary scrutiny before involving in taking military action by choice in the context of a civil war where both sides equally atrocious.’          The poll, conducted on Tuesday and yesterday, underlines the problems faced by Theresa May if she pushes ahead with military strikes          Mrs May has said Britain will co-ordinate its response to the incident in the rebel-held town of Douma - where at least 40 people are reported to have been killed - with the US and FranceThe US military appeared to be in position to carry out any attack order this morning with a Navy destroyer – armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles – underway in the eastern MediterraneanAll three of the main opposition parties – Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats – yesterday called on Mrs May to hold a Commons vote before embarking on action.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ‘Parliament should always be given a say on military action. That’s a case that I’ve made going back many, many years in parliament.‘Listen, what happened last weekend was terrible.‘What we don’t want is bombardment which leads to escalation and leads to a hot war between Russia and America over the skies of Syria,’ he added.n Jeremy Corbyn’s brother has claimed the chemical weapons attack in Syria was a hoax. Piers Corbyn retweeted a fake news video from a US conspiracy theory website and tagged his brother in the tweet.Piers Corbyn tweeted: ‘Video of Syria chemical attack is fake news. Some actors masked, others not in danger zone. Slosh water on children to cry. That’s it!’The video, on the Infowars website, suggests the attack on Douma was not carried out by the Assad regime and was the work of actors.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/11/4B131AE300000578-5607281-image-a-24_1523527959056.jpg","title":"Chickens filmed living corpses squalid conditions farms supply Nandos","story":"    Chickens are allegedly being forced to live in squalid and cramped conditions at Stewkley Farm in Buckinghamshire          The video, released by animal welfare charity PETA, shows the small chickens cooped up in long rows with barely any walking spaceThe charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable.\u0027PETA director Elisa Allen said: \u0027Faccenda Foods is trying to hoodwink compassionate consumers with its glib, baseless nods to animal welfare.\u0027PETA is calling on authorities to hold this company accountable for duping people into thinking otherwise.\u0027A PETA spokesperson added: \u0027This footage was recorded at a Faccenda farm.\u0027Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK, supplying five of the largest retailers.\u0027The company claims: \u0027\u0027All our farms are certified to Red Tractor Farm Assurance standards, or equivalent, and we have a zero tolerance attitude toward anything that jeopardises the health and well-being of the animals in our care.\u0027Our birds might not able to talk but they are still the ones who tell us we\u0027re getting it right.\u0027\u0027The charity say they had also spotted signs of bumblefoot - a condition which causes pus-filled abscesses - on some birds.           The charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable\u0027          Many of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds          They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even standMany of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds.They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even stand.PETA said that chickens are killed at around 40 days old, when they reach \u0027slaughter weight\u0027.Other practices are said to include chickens being scalded in de-feathering tanks - sometimes while still conscious.Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK and sells meat to national firms such as Asda, Lidl, and Nando\u0027s.A spokesman for the company said: \u0027All of our farms operate to standards above EU and UK legislation.\u0027They are independently audited and visited on a regular basis by an external vet to monitor bird health and welfare.\u0027Revealed: Salmonella in chicken salad killed 1 person and...Is the most Australian athlete ever?

The space was incorporated into the crypt of St Michael’s when the church was built in 1831 near the top of Highgate Hill in north London.“It has been said that you could see it as appropriate, but it is not in a very fitting state for him, and the family would support the plans to improve it,” said Richard Coleridge, the poet’s great-great-great-grandson, a police officer based in Newham. Coleridge’s well preserved lead coffin is just visible through a ventilation brick, together with those of his wife, Sara, his daughter, also Sara, his son-in-law and his grandson.The church plans to clear and restore the crypt – which is still half full of rubble from the demolished mansion, Ashhurst House, that preceded the church – and allow access to the last resting place of one of the most renowned English poets.At present the only way of visiting it is to go down a flight of stairs, through a door and then to clamber over and around piles of bricks and dust. “From a safety point of view it would be quite impossible to bring members of the public down here,” said the vicar, Kunle Ayodeji. “But we hope that the whole crypt can be cleared as a space for meetings and other uses, which would also allow access to Coleridge’s cellar. I don’t think we would open up a view of the coffins, but we could place a suitable inscription on the wall.”Coleridge, author of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, was a genius who suffered from poor health and depression. A heavy drinker, he also became addicted to opium in the form of laudanum originally prescribed for his health, and died aged 61 in July 1834.Coleridge could see the distinctive red door of the handsome new church from his last home across the green, where he lodged with a doctor he hoped could cure him – a house now owned by the model Kate Moss. He was buried in the nearby chapel of Highgate school. In 1961 it was noted that Coleridge’s vault had become derelict, and after an international fundraising appeal the coffins were moved to St Michael’s, with the poet laureate John Masefield giving an address at the unveiling of the stone. But in the words of Drew Clode, a member of the St Michael’s stewardship committee, “poor Coleridge was moved from a tip to a tip – they put the coffins in a convenient space which was dry and secure, and quite suitable, bricked them up and forgot about them, and never did anything about the rest of the space”.As people died or moved away from the parish, the exact location of the coffins was forgotten, until a recent excavation revealed the entrance to the wine vault. The gap was just large enough to shine a torch through the ventilation block in the 1960s brick wall, and the excavators discovered the five lead coffins. They lay not where most thought, in the far corner of the crypt, but almost directly below the inscription “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge” on the prominent memorial slab in the nave. “So that was a bit of a clue really,” said Clode.The church is planning a special Coleridge day in June with recitals and lectures, with several members of his family expected to be present, to raise funds towards the restoration project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de373182fc370930fccde74e93f4b63e542eeaa/544_213_1818_1091/master/1818.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7f9969d203ea73999524f7c9f6adc1c1 2600w","title":"science fiction and fantasy roundup review","story":"Autonomous (Orbit, £8.99) is the debut novel from Annalee Newitz, a science journalist and co-founder of the SF website io9.

She also pirates a drug known as Zacuity, designed to aid concentration. When she learns that it has lethal side-effects undisclosed by its makers, the Zaxy Corporation, Chen turns whistleblower and must flee the ruthless agents of the International Property Coalition. What could easily descend into a routine run-around chase\u0026nbspcaper is given moral and intellectual depth by Newitz’s examination of corporate behaviour and the limits of personal freedom. A grim dystopia which asks pertinent questions about the role of artificial intelligence and the ethics of the pharmaceutical industry, Autonomous is thrilling and stimulating.After the terrible global conflict known as the climate wars, humankind has constructed a last redoubt: the floating city of Qaanaaq in the Arctic Circle. In Sam J Miller’s first novel for adults, Blackfish City (Orbit, £12.99), we follow the lives of a gay playboy suffering a debilitating mental disease, a\u0026nbspbrain-damaged fighter fallen on hard times, a well-off government administrator and a gender-neutral courier who works for the underworld. What links these well-drawn and disparate characters is the story of a woman who came to the city on the back of an orca, offering hope. Qaanaaq is vividly brought to life in all its squalid glory, and Miller excels at depicting a metropolis bursting at the seams and populated by both refugees and the elite. Blackfish City is a compelling dystopian thriller.In The Wolf (Headline, £16.99), the ambitious first novel in the Under the Northern Sky series, Leo Carew depicts the island of Albion sundered by war between the Anakim, warrior-giants of the north, and the smaller Suthernors. When the Anakim’s revered leader is killed in battle, his son Roper must utilise all his scheming wiles to take his place – and it’s the convoluted political intrigue, as Roper retreats to his icy northern fastness and plots against usurpers in his own kingdom as well as against the invading warriors of the south, that Carew handles so well. Roper is at once clever and vulnerable, and touchingly aware of his own limitations and inexperience. It’s an absorbing study of one man’s rise to power, and something of a slow burner – imagine Game of Thrones rewritten by John le Carré – with some magnificent world-building (the northern Black Kingdom is graphically rendered in all its wintry bleakness). Featuring excellent anthropological observations of the opposing cultures of the Anakim and the Suthernors, and building inexorably towards its climactic battle, The Wolf is a marvellously accomplished debut.“Mallory wouldn’t return to the bathroom because that’s where the dead man was …” Stephen Lloyd Jones’s fourth novel, The Silenced (Headline, £8.99), hits the ground running and never lets up. Mallory Grace has killed the assassin who came to kill her, but\u0026nbspthat’s only the start of her troubles: her pursuers will stop at nothing to see her dead, and the chase is on… Meanwhile, reclusive SF nerd and animal lover Obe Macintosh is\u0026nbspmysteriously targeted by gunmen at an animal sanctuary at Land’s End. What follows, as Mallory and Obe meet up andare pursued across Europe by a fanatical death-cult called the Vasi, is an\u0026nbspelectrifying supernatural chiller that slowly reveals the reasons behind this merciless pursuit. Mallory is an Arayici, part of an ancient bloodline which has served as “an accelerator\u0026nbsppedal for humanity’s development” for 80,000 \u0026nbspyears, and the Vasi are her mortal enemies, whose aim is to wipe out not only the Arayici but the\u0026nbspentire human race. While The Silenced will win\u0026nbspno\u0026nbspprizes for prose-style or originality, it’s a\u0026nbspgripping page-turner.In The Tangled Lands (Head of Zeus, £18.99) by Paolo Bacigalupi and Tobias S Buckell, the ancient city of Khaim is the last stronghold of a crumbling empire, and the city itself is under siege. The invader is not the marauding army familiar from so many fantasy epics,\u0026nbspbut a pernicious weed, a bramble that sprouts and takes irrevocable hold wherever magic is practised. The use of magic is forbidden on pain of death, a rule broken only by the very desperate and those wealthy enough to get away with it. Against this rich, intriguing background the authors have each written two novellas, charting the fates of a erse cast in the dying city. The stand-out tales open and close the volume. In Bacigalupi’s “The Alchemist”, the eponymous old man runs the risk of \u0026nbspdeath by using magic spells to save his dying daughter while inventing a device to kill the weed, with unforeseen and moving consequences. Buckell’s harrowing “The Blacksmith’s Daughter” depicts the plight of Sofija, who must fight injustice to save her parents. Exploring themes of power, corruption, greed and thwarted hope, the authors deliver an absorbing and sensitive fantasy.• Eric Brown’s latest novel is Murder Takes a Turn (Severn House).

The BBC appoints a prominent radical leftist, a lifelong Bennite, the chairman of the publisher of a prominent leftwing publication no less, as its flagship political presenter and interviewer. This person has made speeches in homage of Karl Marx calling for the establishment of full-blooded socialism in Britain, including a massive increase in public ownership, hiking taxes on the rich to fund a huge public investment programme, and reversing anti-union laws. They appear on our “impartial” Auntie Beeb wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of a hardline leftist thinktank. Their BBC editor is a former Labour staffer who moves to become Jeremy Corbyn’s communications chief. They use their Twitter feed – where they have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to a platform handed to them by the BBC – to promote radical leftist causes.This would never happen. It is unthinkable, in fact. If the BBC establishment somehow entered this parallel universe, the British press would be on the brink of insurrection. And yet, the strange case of Andrew Neil, the ultra-Thatcherite former Sunday Times editor who is the BBC’s flagship political presenter, is an instructive example about how our media works.Neil is a formidable political interviewer in many ways: forensic, unrelenting, quick-witted, sardonic. But consider the background of this former Conservative party researcher. When Jeremy Corbyn had the audacity to meet with leftwing Jewish group Jewdas, Neil smeared them as “nutters” last year, he made a speech denouncing antisemitism on the left. To be clear, leftwing antisemitism exists and must be vanquished. But Neil has no moral authority on this issue. As editor of the Sunday Times in 1992, he hired Britain’s foremost Holocaust denier, Nazi apologist David Irving, to work on the Goebbels diaries. To hire a sympathiser of Hitler and denier of the worst atrocity in history to do respectable work for a national newspaper – to offer a reputational lifeline to a man who should have been treated as a pariah – was a disgrace for which he has never apologised. As the Wiener Library, the oldest institution devoted to the study of the Holocaust, said at the time: “David Irving denies the gas chambers. Anyone who deals with him is tainted with that.”Not long after becoming a high-profile BBC presenter, Neil made a speech in homage to rightwing radical Friedrich Hayek, in which he called for a “radical programme to liberalise the British economy a radical reduction in tax and public spending as a share of the economy” as well as a flat tax “and the injection of choice and competition into the public sector on a scale not yet contemplated”. During last year’s general election, he presented the Daily Politics wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of the hardcore neoliberal Adam Smith Institute. His editor was Robbie Gibb, a former adviser to Michael Portillo – another longstanding colleague of Neil on This Week. Last year Gibb became Theresa May’s head of communications.Neil’s Twitter account – which has hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to his BBC gig – is routinely used to promote rightwing causes. He uses this platform to denounce the scientific consensus on climate change, reviling what he calls “the climate mafia” and claiming that deviation from the consensus meant “the witch-finders want to burn you”. It is not the first time he has deviated from scientific consensus. When he was Sunday Times editor, his newspaper ran a series of articles arguing that HIV did not cause Aids. It was a theme picked up by the Spectator 15 years later. Let’s be clear: this contemptible myth risked people’s lives. His Twitter feed, too, reveals a relentless sympathy for Brexit and denunciation of its critics. A valid political perspective, but not coming from the BBC’s main politics presenter on the biggest issue facing Britain. Again unsurprising, given that he once called “for a reorientation of British foreign policy away from Europe towards Asia and Latin America”and “unilateral free trade, regardless of the policy in Brussels”.His firebrand rightwing politics aside, Neil skins politicians alive across the political spectrum, comes the inevitable retort. There is no question that Neil is exceptionally bright and well-read with an acute eye for detail: it is a grave error to turn up unprepared with him in the chair, as I discovered in one of my earliest TV appearances. And yes, he did recently take down a Tory minister for the absurd smears against Corbyn over a crank ex-Czechoslovak spy: that he was applauded for doing his job here shows how low the left’s expectations are. But as a general rule, while Neil will fillet politicians on both left and right on the basis of competence, he reserves his ideological assaults for the left, ridiculing Corbyn over Russia – which one would expect on US TV networks, where impartiality rules do not apply.Last month, when Green MP Caroline Lucas tabled an Urgent Question on bullying and harassment in Parliament, Neil excoriated her for not talking about rape in Telford instead. When Lucas responded that the Telford case was “absolutely appalling” and that she backed an urgent public inquiry into the matter, but that didn’t mean MPs shouldn’t get their own House in order, Neil denounced her for making a comparison between “what some middle class women had suffered” and the Telford scandal – one he alone had made. The consequence was an online pile-on. Imagine if a prominent leftwing BBC journalist existed and launched such a baseless out-of-nowhere attack on a rightwing politician?Why does this all matter? Critiquing any prominent journalist normally results in a defensive backlash: it is regarded as the ultimate sin within media ranks. But the issue here is about a system. The media are one of the most essential pillars of any democracy, and must be critiqued as such. The usual BBC defence is that the corporation is attacked from both sides, and therefore must be neutral. This is a logical fallacy. For one, it does not take into account which side is more assertive or dominant. Our press overwhelmingly supports the Tories and is intolerant of even mild deviations from rightwing orthodoxy. The BBC itself is dominated by social and economic liberalism, which is why it provokes ire from left and right: but that isn’t neutrality, either. Its daily news priorities are set and framed by the front pages of Conservative-supporting newspapers.Neil himself would be the most intimidating and effective rightwing polemicist in Britain if he was freed from the BBC. But the fact that somebody as stridently leftwing as he is rightwing would never be appointed to such a position is indicative of how our media operate. Many on the left fear that any critique of Auntie will play into the hands of a right wing that would privatise and gut the BBC if it could. This deference means that BBC political output remains framed by rightwing assumptions. The Media Reform Coalition has suggested a series of proposals, such as freeing the BBC from all government interference and a BBC board elected by licence-payers and BBC staff. At the very least, as the case of Neil underlines, the left – which, after all, represents millions of Britons – must stop accepting its continued media marginalisation as just one of those things. It isn’t – and it must change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c5b9eebc9236f96aecae916f8bd3017714cbcd/0_95_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2af4bfa75d62f5686918a963aba19d6b 1240w","title":"young people free bus passes labour","story":"Free bus passes for the under-25s – that’s Labour’s latest retail offer to the young, unveiled today by Jeremy Corbyn. It’s a good idea, but still a lot less generous than many older people’s free travel passes. Outside London over-65s get bus concessions in London the over-60s get not just free buses but free tubes as well, even for high earners still in work. So no one should begrudge this modest offer to the young.It will save 13 million young people an average of £1,000 a year on fares that low-earning families often can’t afford. Labour has pledged to restore the education maintenance allowance, worth up to £30 a week to 16- to 19-year-olds still in education. Its abolition by the coalition had a devastating effect on low-income families trying to keep teenagers in school and college with no free school meals or travel.Free buses would be one step towards an urgently needed intergenerational shift against the tide of wealth and income flowing away from the young into the well-protected pockets of the old. The £1.4bn cost would come from vehicle excise duty, using funds currently allocated to road building, which would then be covered by its new National Transformation Fund.This policy is a tiptoe towards universal basic services, a policy idea that sprang last year from King’s College’s Prof Jonathan Portes and UCL’s Prof Henrietta Moore. Rather than universal basic income, they suggest providing universal services such as free buses, free wifi and telephones, plus free food and housing for the poorest, as a more effective redistribution.Their universal free buses would cost £5bn, a price that looks like a remarkably good bargain. The message it sends out – that anyone has the right to travel anywhere – embraces a sense of universal community it would be hard to obtain with £5bn spent on anything else. Bus passes for the old are so popular with Tory and Labour voters alike that no party in its right mind would dare take them away – or even to means-test them for those needing no subsidy from less well-off taxpayers. To offer free buses to all is the right way to make it fairer.However, the political question is whether Labour announcing yet more spending at this point does anything for Corbyn’s weak economic credibility, as he stays a dismal 10 points behind Theresa May as best to run the economy and lead the country. Labour needs policies that shore up public belief in its fiscal probity to reach beyond its young base – already pollsters find age is the single biggest determinant as to whether someone votes Labour or Tory. Good policies don’t win without good politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478bb21ec54d098e66a10fd785c41962e6f351a2/0_309_5142_3085/master/5142.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77d3e551793ee7fded4795957501267f 1240w","title":"tips student tenants red flags spot housing","story":"From legal questions about the tenancy to budgeting for bills, here’s how to find the right student propertyMoving into your first student house or flat is a rite of passage for a lot of young people. It’ll be your home from home for many months, so you need to find the right property. Whether you’re after a warm place to study or a pre-drinks venue, here’s what to consider before signing up.A shared student house is usually a house in multiple occupation (HMO) governed by strict criteria under the Housing Act 2004, which stipulates that rooms must be a minimum of 6.51 sq metres. The local authority will set amenity standards, such as the number of bathrooms, toilets, handbasins and sinks, and the size of worktops and fridge space. Most shared student homes require a licence, so you should make sure you see one before signing the tenancy. Landlords and agents are legally required to provide certain documents to tenants, including the gas safety certificate, energy performance certificate (EPC) and deposit protection certificate. Squeezing in with your mates may sound like fun, but space is hugely important for students, says Les Back, a sociology professor at Goldsmiths, University of London. Landlords may use shared space as extra bedrooms to maximise profit, so be aware of how this can affect your studies and wellbeing. “The lack of study space to work at home can’t be healthy at all,” says Back. “Students need support. Degrees can be incredibly demanding socially, intellectually and emotionally and it doesn’t help when accommodation is pressurised.”Students today are more discerning about the type of property they are prepared to rent than they were a generation ago. This means landlords are no longer able to buy rundown properties, throw in some secondhand beds and desks and sit back while the rent comes in. Nowadays, students can expect high-speed, reliable internet connection, a communal living area and some well-kept outside space.Always ask to see the EPC. According to an NUS spokesperson, half of students report feeling uncomfortably cold in their accommodation, and many properties are draughty or poorly insulated: “The most commonly encountered complaint in rented accommodation is damp, condensation or mould. Alarmingly, almost a quarter of respondents reported having slugs, mice or another infestation in their home – so make sure to ask plenty of questions about the state of the property.”Talk to the current tenants if possible. Finding out why they are leaving and the worst thing about the house could help raise red flags.For most students, this will be the first time they have had to look for a house and take out a private tenancy. So, with less experience of how the market operates, they are at higher risk of being exploited by landlords or agents. Getting a fair break clause is one way to ensure you can leave the property if you have to. Six months is the legal minimum of a tenancy. Agents are increasingly offering longer-term tenancies, but David Cox, chief executive of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, says they should rarely be taken up without a six-month break clause. This also means private landlords need to up their game to remain competitive. “Purpose-built accommodation is likely to be a lot swankier and possibly offer on-site facilities unlike traditional houses converted for student living. That said, the latter may offer a greater opportunity to meet and get to know your landlord and build a direct connection with them, which can be invaluable in resolving any issues that crop up,” says Davis.Decide what you can afford before you start house-hunting. Remember you will have to budget for gas, electricity, water, phone, internet and a TV licence, as well as food and general household items. Find out which, if any, bills are included. Beware of agency scams. “One thing I remember is just before you sign the lease they always ring you up and pretend someone has just put a last-minute offer in and ask if you want to go higher to beat it, to squeeze more money out of you,” says former law student John Cole, 28, from Yorkshire.Ask yourself how convenient the area is. That means looking at local amenities, but also considering costs such as transport. Although it can be cheaper to live further away from your university, it may be important to be close to the library and be around other students who can provide support.

The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur.The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current.Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches.“Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought.The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa.They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so.The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.”A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/333a2d5255a1873663b85aaa376ea2f52f683911/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9d92759e93f0e6e7a8844ba6a7d312f4 1240w","title":"worlds first electrified road for charging vehicles opens in sweden","story":"Stretch of road outside Stockholm transfers energy from two tracks of rail in the road, recharging the batteries of electric cars and trucksThe world’s first electrified road that recharges the batteries of cars and trucks driving on it has been opened in Sweden.About 2km (1.2 miles) of electric rail has been embedded in a public road near Stockholm, but the government’s roads agency has already drafted a national map for future expansion.The technology behind the electrification of the road linking Stockholm Arlanda airport to a logistics site outside the capital city aims to solve the thorny problems of keeping electric vehicles charged, and the manufacture of their batteries affordable.Energy is transferred from two tracks of rail in the road via a movable arm attached to the bottom of a vehicle. The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected.The electrified road is ided into 50m sections, with an inidual section powered only when a vehicle is above it.When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user.The “dynamic charging” – as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts – means the vehicle’s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs.A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road.Hans Säll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology.In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, Säll said.“If we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,” he added. “The distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.”At a cost of €1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line.Säll said: “There is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.”National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5737084aebc6349dee3cf65659b5b9717c15c8/0_0_4000_2693/master/4000.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6413ceb21b140c9362ec1386d4696046 1010w","title":"in to flora the best floral dresses in pictures","story":"Florals at springtime may not be groundbreaking, but they always make you feel good.

Veteran French auteur Godard’s film Le Livre d’Image is a video essay in the style of many of his recent works, while Pawlikowski’s Cold War tells the story of a romance set across multiple countries in the 1950s. Lee, meanwhile, will debut BlacKkKlansman a crime drama about an African American man who infiltrates a Ku Klux Klan chapter, it is likely to be among the most provocative films in this year’s competition. The trio are joined in the race for the Palme d’Or by directors from Egypt, Japan, Lebanon, South Korea and China. Also included in the official selection films by two dissident directors who have been in conflict with the governments of their homelands: Jafar Panahi, who has been banned from leaving his native Iran, will debut Three Faces, while Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been under house arrest since 2010 over fraud charges, will debut Leto, a drama about the underground rock and roll scene in Soviet Russia. Cannes festival director Thierry Frémaux urged both Russia and Iran to let the directors attend this year’s event.Another Iranian director, Asghar Farhardi, will open the festival with his film Everybody Knows, a thriller that stars Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem. David Robert Mitchell moves from horror (It Follows) to film noir with Under the Silver Lake, which stars Andrew Garfield while Gomorrah and Tale of Tales director Matteo Garrone will present his “urban western” Dogman.Wim Wenders, meanwhile, will appear out of competition with Francis: A Man of His Word, a behind-the-scenes documentary about Pope Francis’s time as head of the catholic church. The Star Wars spin-off Solo will also premiere out of competition, while Christopher Nolan will present a special 70mm screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey.While the lineup for this year’s festival was global in scope, there was a notable absence of female directors. Only three of the 18 films competing for this year’s Palme d’Or are directed by women, the same number as at last year’s festival, a situation criticised at the time by Cannes jury member Jessica Chastain. Notable too is the absence of several major films that had been tipped for inclusion. There is no place The House That Jack Built, the serial killer drama directed by von Trier. Von Trier had been banned from the festival in 2011 after the director describing himself as “a Nazi” and said that he “understood Hitler”, but had been widely expected to be welcomed back for this year’s event.Also missing is Leigh’s historical epic Peterloo, while Gilliam’s long-awaited comedy The Man Who Killed Don Quixote cannot be screened at the festival due to a legal dispute between Gilliam and one of the movie’s backers.It is possible that one or more of those films will be added to the lineup at a later date, with Frémaux promising more news on Von Trier’s film in “a few days”. However, one name that will definitely absent from this year’s lineup is that of Netflix, with the company’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos announcing on Wednesday that none of the streaming giant’s films would be screening at the festival. The move comes in response to a ruling by Cannes that demands that all films competing for prizes at the festival receive a full theatrical release.Australian actor Cate Blanchett is president of this year’s jury, which will award the Palme d’Or and the other main prizes. Usual Suspects and Sicario star Benicio del Toro will head the Un Certain Regard jury.The Cannes film festival will be held from 8 to 19 May.

A part of that journey is captured in the Netflix film Come Sunday, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, premiering on 13 April.For the director, Josh Marston, Pearson’s story was especially important to tell right now in an era of “fake news” and hardening isions. “In this day and age when people have become increasingly entrenched in their views, here’s someone who examined what he believes and actually revised his thinking right before thousands of people who had him under a microscope,” Marston said. “It just takes an incredible amount of bravery.”Pearson was born into the Pentecostal tradition and preached the gospel for more than forty years. He cast out his first demon when he was just a teen. A gifted orator and disciple of the late Oral Roberts – whom many consider the godfather of televangelism – he rapidly built a large national profile in the 1990s, counseling presidents alongside the likes of Billy Graham.“I lived at that same street – theologically mentally and emotionally – in that same street address for 50 years. For generations, actually,” he said.But in the early 2000s, Pearson began to question one of the most fundamental elements of his faith: hell. In the film, his character breaks down, poring over his Bible as he watches a program on the Rwandan genocide. How can a loving god cast all people – babies and children – into hell just because they haven’t heard the word?“For all the Bible says that the only way to heaven is through Christ, there’s just as much that says we don’t need to,” Ejiofor’s character tells his congregation in the film, to gasps and confused stares. The film mostly rests on the concept of Pearson’s rejection of hell, but in some ways that was only a jumping-off point for the bishop, who ultimately came to reconsider the most bedrock elements of his faith. Today even the language of personal revelation – a core evangelical tenet – is strained for him. “It’s really me thinking out loud or thinking to myself it’s not really God talking to me from some outer source,” he said.The questions Pearson battled were not exactly new in Christianity, and neither were the answers he arrived at. Reconciling the jealous, genocidal and cantankerous God of the Bible with his terrestrial avatar, Jesus Christ, the prince of peace, has been a central occupation of Christian theologists for generations. The conclusion, too, that all humankind are to some degree redeemed by Christ’s “perfect” sacrifice on the cross, has been around in various sects for about as long.What makes Pearson’s story so unique is his starting point: the harsh biblical literalism of Pentecostal faith, and the smarmy world of American televangelism. In that world, Pearson wasn’t asking deep and probing theological questions – he was a heretic who had probably been possessed by the devil. “Satan is a snake, a ventriloquist, and he chose to speak through you,” Roberts, played by Martin Sheen with just the right amount of Oklahoma drawl, tells Pearson in the film. Pearson said the extent of his shunning was nearly total. “Most of them just walked away, but the ones who turned on us were vicious – and it was like sticking a knife and just turning it in there.”But where others saw demons, Pearson saw liberation. There was always this omnipresent strain of guilt embedded in his Pentecostal faith. Not the personal, probing guilt of say, Roman Catholicism, but something far more grandiose. As the faith held, and still holds, only those who are “saved” or “born again” – those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal lord and savior – can go to heaven when they die. For Pearson, then, any time he made no effort to convert a stranger, it was as though he’d made a callous decision to let them burn in hell, just to spare himself the trouble. This thinking left Pearson in a constant state of judgment. He said he would walk by someone smoking a cigarette or drinking a beer and think to himself: if they died today, they’re going straight to Hell. “Stupid thoughts like that had invaded and corroded my whole consciousness for years,” Pearson said.“I cannot tell you how liberating that was,” Pearson said, of relinquishing those beliefs. “This tension, the stress and the constant sense of failure – I finally went from self-loathing (that I didn’t know I was experiencing) to self-loving.”He continues to preach his new, more progressive message, which he calls “Metacostalism”, and it seems to straddle the line between faith and a more secular strain of self-actualization teachings. His profile and his flock are smaller, but Pearson has peace.“That’s why I’m so desperate to get other people to hear this, whether, Jew, Christian atheist or other. It’s not that bad. It’s all in our hands. We can fix this since we’re the ones that screwed it up.”Marston, for his part, hopes the streaming release will open up the film’s message to folks who would otherwise be discouraged from viewing it.“The advantage of Netflix is that there are a whole population of people for whom getting in their car and driving to the local theater in a small town and being seen by fellow congregants going into a movie about a heretic would be unthinkable,” Marston said. “They’ll be able to sit at home and, in the privacy of their living room, give into their curiosity and maybe be provoked to think critically about what they believe and where they stand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d347b4273c16ae653674ecee2b2fb28510125878/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bfac315d364d30692c8f009da75dbc36 1240w","title":"the titan review sam worthington","story":"Lennart Ruff’s feature debut starts with an ingenious premise but takes a wrong turn by sacrificing scares for schmaltzNot a bad idea, this. But where it could have delivered a mounting sense of dread, crowned with horror, the film seems concerned to hedge its bets by balancing the disturbing stuff with a feelgood drama about a family pulling together. It’s a sci-fi mystery thriller, distributed by Netflix and directed by feature first-timer Lennart Ruff, based on an original story idea by screenwriter Arash Amel.We are some decades in the future overpopulation and ecological calamity have made Earth uninhabitable, and our only chance is to send some tough pioneers to Titan, a moon of Saturn with an atmosphere in which homo sapiens could conceivably survive with the right genetic modifications. Sam Worthington plays Lt Rick Janssen, a tough military man who has volunteered for the top-secret medical programme, Taylor Schilling plays his wife Abi and Noah Jupe is their son Lucas. Tom Wilkinson plays the careworn Professor Collingwood, who is masterminding this last-chance scheme for Humanity 2.0. At first, Rick and his family are pretty thrilled by the luxurious LA-style home that they are allowed to occupy for the programme’s duration, and this is interestingly presented. But as Rick and his fellow guinea-pigs undergo a brutal drugs regimen it becomes progressively clear that they have not been told everything about what is happening to them. It is the kind of sci-fi drama in which the point is not interplanetary space travel, it is all about the tension and conspiracy on the home front.

Could his Crossrail-tunnel-proportioned arms take him even further?Dwayne Johnson is big. Really big. The WWE wrestler-turned-Hollywood star is 6ft 4in, a solid 250lb-worth of hunk – a muscular alpha monument of a guy, much like the “Brahma bull” logo which he has tattooed on to one of his Crossrail-tunnel-proportioned arms.Yet his shaven head, which he has sported for some years now, also gives him a kind of Buddha-like calm to go with the bulk, an easy geniality that makes him castable in family adventures and action comedies. Aged 45, he is up at 5am every day to work out for at least a couple of hours, a regime he inherited from his dad, Rocky Johnson, himself a professional wrestler, from whom Johnson adapted his wrestling name – The Rock. Johnson is of impeccable wrestling lineage. His Samoan grandfather, Peter Maivia, was a legend among wrestling fans.And Johnson is big in another way. He is now simply the world’s biggest movie star. In 2015, his films reportedly made $1.488bn at the box office . In an industry which desperately needs tentpole stars and above-the-title players, people whose simple presence can “open” a movie, Johnson is a prince. As he today opens his new, outrageously silly extravaganza, Rampage, Johnson is entering his celebrity prime, now confident enough to discuss his problems with depression, his tough upbringing and the agony of witnessing his mother’s attempt at taking her own life after they were evicted from their apartment when he was a teenager.But how did this happen? What exactly has he done? Has he ever made any good films? It is difficult to pin down quite what roles Johnson has made his own. Arnie had The Terminator, Sylvester had Rambo and Rocky, Bruce had Die Hard and, these days, Tom has Mission: Impossible. But Dwayne isn’t like that, and he’s not a classic action star, either. He has spread his career and brand identity into a wider portfolio of genres and franchise properties, and the return on these has collectively added up to a colossal amount of celebrity clout.Like Arnie with Conan the Barbarian, Johnson began by parleying his muscles into a “mythic” role. He was The Scorpion King in 2002, a role spun off from his small part in The Mummy Returns the year before. Johnson made action movies such as The Rundown in 2003 and the not-much-liked Doom in 2005, based on a video game. He had a brief and very surreal flirtation with auteur-arthouse, making his debut at the Cannes film festival in Richard Kelly’s cult movie Southland Tales in 2007, alongside Seann William Scott. But his career takeoff really came at the end of the decade, when he made his debut in the fifth movie in the petrolhead Fast and Furious franchise, playing Luke Hobbs, the Government agent dedicated to taking on Vin Diesel’s daredevil criminal Dominic “Dom” Toretto. Johnson siphoned off the huge popularity of these movies into his own career petrol tank. But he also played the lead in Disney’s Race To Witch Mountain, the action-adventure remake of the 1975 film Escape To Witch Mountain. And if you’ve got tweenage children and they’ve ever had a sleepover, with a DVD being put on, then you will have witnessed the awesome power of this film. Johnson is a lovable dad.His secret is that he didn’t go down the pure action route, still less the “Hulk” blind alley suffered by someone like, say, Lou Ferrigno. Like Arnie, he is self-aware and good-natured enough to play comedy and family-oriented movies – but, unlike Arnie, it wasn’t a matter of irony or sending himself up. With his open, wide-eyed face and unassuming, essentially unaggressive persona, he could carry it off. And he can be funny — developing a genuinely successful odd-couple double-act with the standup Kevin Hart in the films Central Intelligence and Jumani: Welcome To The Jungle. They are like Schwarzenegger and DeVito in Twins. He is the action Dean Martin to Kevin’s Jerry Lewis. He is also working on a double-act spinoff from Fast and Furious with Jason Statham, and he cheerfully declares they will be called “Dwaytham”.For Johnson, being a nice guy is a central part of his persona. But it wasn’t always like this. As a college football star at the University of Miami, he had a ferocious temper, and was always getting into fights. In his wrestling career in the 90s and early 00s, Johnson was originally cast as the “heel”, the bad guy, always trash-talking and insulting his opponents – including that other wrestler-turned-actor, John Cena. And even now, in his movie career, we have seen flashes of Johnson’s dark side. “Vin and I had a few discussions, including an important face-to-face in my trailer,” Johnson icily told Rolling Stone of an incident during the filming of Fast and Furious. “And what I came to realise is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach movie-making and collaborating.” Quite a paraphrase.For the moment, The Rock is the colossus of the industry. Will he progress to something more solid? Does he even need to? As he grows into character roles, Johnson might have something bigger to show us before he taps out. He has spoken about how he hopes one day to host the Oscars … maybe even win an Oscar. And, last May, while hosting Saturday Night Live, he announced his bid for the US presidency in 2020, with Tom Hanks as his running mate. Of course, he was just kidding. Or was he?"},{"url":null,"title":"a savage and sadistic way to go out italian press reacts to real madrid v juventus","story":"There was considerable anger in Italy after Michael Oliver’s late penalty gave Real Madrid a 4-3 aggregate win over Juventus“Not like this.” Those words recurred over and over throughout the Italian media’s coverage of Juventus’s Champions League elimination, with Tuttosport turning them into a front-page headline. There are occasions when the Turin-based newspaper’s journalists seem to witness games very differently to those elsewhere on the peninsula. This was not one of those times.“If there is a savage and sadistic way to be eliminated, then this is it,” wrote Fabrizio Bocca in La Repubblica. “Better, much better, to go to the Bernabéu, lose the match and amen. See you again next year. Like this, no, like this everything stays open and everything feels unfinished, like a door slammed in your face.”And who had closed that door, exactly? Not Madrid, not Cristiano Ronaldo, even if his penalty was beautifully struck. There was little more than a grain of criticism to be found for Mehdi Benatia, whose injury-time challenge on Lucas Vázquez led to the spot-kick.Instead, the focus fell squarely on the referee who had awarded it. “If Mr Michael Oliver, United Kingdom, 33 years old from Ashington, wanted to put his name down in history then he succeeded,” wrote Tuttosport’s Guido Vaciago. “Real Madrid will not easily forget him, honoured as they were with a penalty that perhaps was not counterfeit, but certainly generous. “Juventus will not forget him either, a dream snatched away, that is if Gigi Buffon dreams, he who Mr Oliver sent off just to be sure of adding a legendary touch to his display.” Analysis of inidual refereeing decisions are a regular feature of Italy’s sports pages. There were subtly different takes from the various “moviola” (replay) columnists, with some defining the penalty as soft and others as an outright travesty. Even those who could see why the incident was punishable under the letter of the law still argued that Oliver should have read the situation better. “To concede a debatable penalty that decides access to the semi-final of the Champions League, on a refereeing level, qualifies a mistake,” opined Francesco Ceniti in Gazzetta dello Sport. “We need to start with this premise before analysing the incident which rightly infuriated Juve. Because every referee knows well that there are moments in which your whistle has a different weight and so you only punish (or should punish) obvious fouls. “Was Benatia’s challenge on Vázquez one of those? No, because the defenders’ intervention was risky, but at the same time open to interpretation. The Spaniard tried to control with his chest from Ronaldo’s knock-down, Benatia arrived from behind and tried everything with his left foot to take the ball off him.“Sure, there was a tiny push with his hands, and then a contact on his underarm. So doubts over the challenge are legitimate, but so is the argument that says this challenge was not worth punishing.”One or two journalists did try to bring readers’ attention back to the football. “Leave the regrets for tomorrow, or maybe never,” wrote Vaciago. “Yes, the first leg, the distractions, the missed chances: tomorrow, or maybe never. Don’t ruin the sensation of having witnessed one of the most beautiful football stories of our lifetime, don’t contaminate that unequivocal certainty that Juventus are one of the strongest teams in the world, on a level with Real Madrid, superior to many other more celebrated sides.”For most, though, the fury was too much to bear. “Juve won on the pitch, and Andrea Angelli won big off it,” wrote Corriere dello Sport’s Alessandro Vocalelli, noting the Juventus president’s criticisms not only of Oliver but of the man who assigns the officials for Champions League matches – Pierluigi Collina.His newpaper’s front-page headline put it more concisely. “What a robbery,” it read."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744724dab64b26b0a50d319006fb28531633296e/0_33_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1aa55178f48e284cfef4efade6f57330 1240w","title":"six of the most dramatic nights european cup champions league","story":"The almost shocking conclusion to what had been a notable Juventus recovery against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu has not only ided opinion – it was a penalty all day long, one could only admire the stealth with which Medhi Benatia administered his shove in the back of Lucas Vázquez and the bravery of Michael Oliver for punishing it – but has also inspired much talk of the evening being one of the most dramatic in the history of the European Cup and Champions League. However the latter stages of the competition have frequently produced controversy, spectacle and drama. Here are six other notable European nights to consider.Comebacks do not come any more unexpected or spellbinding than this. Call it the greatest of escapes, the miracle of Istanbul or just the ultimate games of two halves but the fact is the first half was so embarrassingly one-sided that some Liverpool supporters are said to have attempted to leave the stadium during the interval, only to find the gates locked. Cue a little tactical adjustment by Rafa Benítez, who brought on Didi Hamann for the second half, and heroic performances by Steven Gerrard and Jerzy Dudek, and Liverpool recovered a three-goal deficit, negotiated extra-time and then won on penalties. Unforgettable.Almost certainly the height of European injustice, as the Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø waved away four reasonable Chelsea penalty appeals before a 90th-minute goal from Andrés Iniesta swept Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona into the final with their only shot on target. One of the most memorable images of the night was Michael Ballack sprinting half the length of the pitch while remonstrating with the hapless official, before Didier Drogba’s sweary rant to the camera at full-time earned him a five-match ban. Øvrebø apologised some years later but it was far too late to earn Guus Hiddink the shot at Manchester United in Rome he so craved.Barcelona were at the height of their supremacy under Guardiola in 2010 but Inter arrived at the Camp Nou with a 3-1 lead from the first leg. The visitors soon went down to 10 men when Thiago Motta was dismissed in the first half but what followed was a defensive masterclass, more organisation than improvisation, as Inter virtually abandoned attack to concentrate their resources on stopping Barcelona from scoring again. This was peak José Mourinho who, after outwitting Guardiola while short-handed, was presented with few problems by Louis van Gaal’s Bayern Munich in the final. Perennial underachievers in Europe, Inter had suddenly landed the treble of the Serie A title, Coppa Italia and Champions League.A 10-goal final certainly sounds dramatic, even if the distribution of goals suggests the showpiece might have been a tad one-sided. In Britain at least, this felt like it was the moment when the European Cup came of age, when the scales fell from insular eyes and the attraction of continental competition was suddenly grasped. The final provided royal entertainment for an immense Hampden Park crowd of 127,621, an audience that seemingly included – just like the Sex Pistols at the Free Trade Hall or the Velvet Underground’s first LP – a great many people who would later be inspired to achievements of their own. If this was football, Britain wanted more.Strange as it might seem now, it came as news to the nation at large to discover there was something intoxicatingly special about European nights at Anfield. Liverpool under Bob Paisley were breaking new ground – in Bill Shankly’s time the club had never been synonymous with European success – and when the French champions scored an away goal the home side needed two more to progress. Thanks in part to a hugely partisan crowd, Ray Kennedy and David “supersub” Fairclough they got them, though knowing what we know now the most arresting sight of the evening was the spilling, seething, all-standing Kop.“Football: bloody hell,” as someone said. The last part of United’s treble was undramatic in normal time – an under-strength side appeared to possess neither the wit nor the will to cancel out Mario Basler’s early goal. The most famous three minutes of stoppage time in history changed all that, however. The substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added one late goal and then another to leave the opposing defenders on the floor in dismay. The Uefa president Lennart Johansson had to remove Bayern’s ribbons from the trophy before presenting it. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “The winners are crying and the losers are dancing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53ae76c2b492cec738fff30997a13067ecff6adc/1053_158_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b570c3860b93c530b42e0a7fb6769fa7 1240w","title":"world cup fiver england russia","story":"Sign up for our free weekly email featuring the latest news, intrigue, analysis and blunders from the 32 competing nationsIn the summer of 2006, as England blundered inexorably through the early stages of the World Cup, Team Fiver made a pact. Should England reach the final, we would spend the entirety of the match going round and round the Circle Line on the London Underground. The train would be totally empty, with the entire country watching the game, allowing us to solemnly quaff cans of Super Tin while praying there would eventually be a slow, weary procession of the glum and the heartbroken, impotent tears slowly moistening the Union Jack paint plastered across their beetroot phizogs. If the opposite happened, and we heard the kind of lusty cheering that could only signal the start of the apocalypse well, we had the emergency Derringer for that.We didn’t particularly mind the England team, but the typhoon of witless presumption that surrounded them was too much to bear. That summer was the apex of English football’s Halfwit Years, when all the Golden Generation had to do was turn up, kick Johnny Foreigner up the trousers and lift the trophy – a plan that was foolproof until they were taken to penalties by Portugal in the quarter-finals.The culture was very hard not to dislike. The Fiver, admittedly, went a bit far with the Union Jack Andrex incident, but we won’t apologise for youthful exuberance. Besides, things have changed since then. In recent times The Fiver has had to wrestle with the most confusing sensations since we were blindsided by puberty. If you tell anyone this, you’re dead … but we kind of want England to do well this summer. Any residual arrogance in the coverage of England is more than leavened by the kind of self-awareness and self-deprecation previously reserved for the England cricket team. The football team has created something new, a likeable kind of gallows hubris.Rather than entering the tournament as certain winners, England go to Russia with the more dignified status of useful outsiders. They have one or two weak points (in goal, in defence, in midfield) but they also have some of the world’s better young players. Harry Kane is the first man to score 1,000 goals in a season, and a youthful core of the team will have benefitted enormously from the Premier League’s galacticoach era. Marcus Rashford is good, too. Nobody really thinks they are going to change the world, but at least they are trying to make it a more interesting place. Their style is the most sophisticated since Terry Venables was in charge, and there is so much to like about Gareth Southgate – not least his utter disdain for the Foreign Secretary he dare not name.It’s always unwise to project too far ahead when a tournament draw is made, so that’s exactly what we’re going to do. The best England can probably hope for is to lose a quarter-final to Brazil or Germany. That’s OK. It’s not how you lose, it’s the way that you lose it. Football tournaments have a habit of turning goodwill into murderous hatred. But if England play good football if the country doesn’t get woefully carried away with a 3-0 win over Panama and if they don’t lose to Iceland, this could be England’s most enjoyable World Cup campaign for a long time. And The Fiver might not need to seek sanctuary on the Circle Line.“It’s about the road more than the arrival. If it were just about the World Cup, I would take a plane.

Rumours regarding a possible successor to the PlayStation 4 have been swirling around tech sites and forums for several days, prompting a few bites from larger news outlets. According to some sources, we could see the PlayStation 5 as soon as this winter.It all started last month, when games writer Marcus Sellars posted a tweet suggesting that PS5 development kits were already being sent out to studios around the world. This was followed last week by subscription-only site Semiaccurate.com claiming to have seen technical details of the machine. According to its report, the PS5 will be based around an AMD accelerated processing unit featuring the manufacturer’s next generation Navi-series GPU and its Zen 2 CPU. These specifications align with a speculative news piece on the Japanese news site PC Watch, posted last June, but while that story predicted a PS5 launch date of 2019 or 2020, the Semiaccurate story states that a 2018 release is technically feasible. Historically, five years has been a sweet spot for developers on Sony’s machines – it’s enough time to have produced a couple of titles, learned the hardware inside out, and developed tricks and techniques to squeeze every pixel out of the graphics processor. It was five years after the launch of the original PlayStation that we got Gran Turismo 2, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Driver and Spider-Man: titles that really pushed the 3D graphics architecture. It was five years after the arrival of PlayStation 2 that we got God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Final Fantasy XII, Bully and Black for the PS3 it was Uncharted 3, Skyrim, Dark Souls and Batman: Arkham City. The consoles were still being pushed at that point, still throwing up new possibilities.True, things are a little different this time. After the hugely complex PS3 Cell processor, which confounded developers for many months, Sony specifically designed PlayStation 4 to let studios get up and running relatively quickly, using a PC-based architecture and involving developers in the design process.However, system architect Mark Cerny also added flexibility into the design to ensure that, from mid-life, developers would have some wiggle room, including the use of the graphics processor to perform other game calculations. Speaking to Gamasutra in 2013, he said: “Our belief is that by the middle of the PlayStation 4 console lifetime, asynchronous compute is a very large and important part of games technology.” He talked about a dozen programs running simultaneously on the GPU and using it to perform physics and collision computations, adding extra depth to the simulation. So even now, we may not be seeing the absolute limits of the hardware.Look at the PS4 this year, and it is clearly not a console in creative or technical decline. God of War and Monster Hunter: World are astonishing, and later we’ll see Spider-Man, Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, The Last of Us Part II and (eventually) Death Stranding. All of these are pushing forward in the areas you’d expect – environmental fidelity, lighting complexity, character modelling – and, more important, they’re doing fresh, interesting things with the hardware, whether that’s exploring new forms of narrative realism or developing AI mass flocking behaviours.Another facet of the current rumours is that virtual reality technology will be an intrinsic part of the PlayStation 5 offering – perhaps via a new dedicated AMD VR chipset. But we’re really not in a place where consumer virtual reality is living up to the hype and excitement generated when Oculus Rift first emerged. The headsets remain bulky, the experiences are limited. Sony may have sold over a million PS VR units, but how many people are regularly using them? Yet maybe, with a couple of years of extra development – both in terms of hardware and game design philosophy – we might be somewhere much more interesting we might be in a place where designers can show us what this uniquely immersive technology can achieve.Sony is winning the console war against Xbox in terms of sales and first-party development it doesn’t need to rush to the end of this cycle. There is an irresistible forward momentum in the games industry, and of course, everyone loves the drama and excitement when some shiny new box is looming on the horizon. But winter 2018 is too soon. Heck, 2019 is too soon. But the year after, with a new generation of processors in place and a couple more years more to get the hang of VR? Well, 2020 does have a nice ring to it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43aa1715ad36aee694d4fbbe76f809d5039da2fe/1345_1100_3791_3792/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=57f8294da13d2768d2d11ba93f86e11f 1240w","title":"felicity cloake masterclass mayonnaise recipe","story":"Back away from the shop-bought stuff and make a mayo to remember with these easy stepsWith a few exceptions, commercial mayonnaise is to homemade as processed cheese is to mature cheddar – convenient, but hard to get excited about. Proper mayo, gently wobbly and yolk-yellow, is a quite different beast: too good to hide away in a sandwich, it deserves to be the star of the show, served with crunchy baby veg, fresh seafood or just a big pile of hot, salty chips.1 egg yolk1 big pinch salt1 tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp white-wine or cider vinegar, or lemon juice250ml light olive, grape seed, sunflower or other neutral oil25ml extra-virgin olive, walnut or rapeseed oilEnsure everything is at room temperature before you get going. This makes the finished product much less likely to split. So, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, take them out at least 30 minutes before you start work.This small amount of mayonnaise is hard to make in most food mixers, but electric beaters will do the trick, as will a whisk and a bit of elbow grease. You will also need a large, sturdy bowl. If you happen to have a stick blender and a tall jug in which it fits snugly, go to step 7.Put a damp cloth under the bowl to anchor it, then put the egg yolk and salt in the bowl. Whisk for about 20 seconds, until slightly thickened, then add the mustard and acid (and a teaspoon of cold water if you’re nervous, though it’s not strictly necessary). Whisk for another 30 seconds. Familiarise yourself with step 6 before going any further.Begin to add the oil into the bowl, drop by painstaking drop, whisking all the time. Don’t be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, because this will make a heavy, often bitter mayonnaise, especially if you’re using electric beaters. It’s far better, and cheaper, to start with a neutral oil and add some extra-virgin at the end.Keep whisking and pouring until the mayonnaise begins to thicken, at which point you can begin to add the oil more quickly, followed by a second, more flavourful oil, if you like. Once all 275ml of the oil has been incorporated and you have a thick, glossy mixture, season to taste. If you’d prefer a thinner consistency, beat in a little water, lemon juice or vinegar.If your mayonnaise splits, it’s easily rescued, as long as you have another egg yolk. Crack this into a fresh bowl, whisk for a minute until thick and sticky, then gradually beat in the split mayonnaise a little at a time, followed by any remaining oil.If you have a stick blender, put all the ingredients except the extra-virgin olive oil into a jug just slightly wider than the blender head. Plunge the blender down to the base of the jug, then turn on and, keeping the blender still, blend on high power for 10 seconds, until you can see the mixture start to emulsify.Once the mayonnaise begins to billow out from the sides of the blender, very slowly move the head upwards through the oil until you have a creamy mayonnaise (repeat this process, if necessary). Beat in the extra-virgin olive oil by hand, then season to taste.Mayonnaise is easy to tailor to need or occasion: fold in a clove of crushed garlic, or a handful of chopped herbs, the zest of an unwaxed lemon, black pepper, chilli sauce, horseradish or wasabi, smoked paprika and lime juice, crumbled blue cheese and chives, curry powder, finely chopped capers anchovies or cornichons, wholegrain mustard – but preferably not all at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e4245e683c703eb722af6978719efdb671cdf/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d6db19fddb35dd028bc204a07afcc5f 2600w","title":"ultra processed truth 10 bestselling foods cherry bakewell fray bentos pies","story":"From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands? Nutritionists assess them – and just what they might mean for our healthAs the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today.We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go.Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although inidually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term.The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says.A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”.His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.”We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating?Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment.Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process.Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.”Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.”A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick.Young’s said it would not be able to comment.There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.”Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other.Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment.“As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing.The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.”A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.”There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil.McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says.A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.”Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott.Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins.Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate).“There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.”Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.”Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate. It also has emulsifiers and flavourings – as well as cheap palm oil – that you wouldn’t have in the kitchen cupboard. These are engineered to give the right silky mouthfeel for a chocolate bar.Cadbury did not respond to requests for comment.“In this environment, it’s really not surprising that we’ve ended up in the situation where half of our calories are coming from ultra-processed foods,” Scott says. Like other food campaigners, she wants TV advertising bans before 9pm and a clampdown on promotions – and some way of making healthy food as cheap as the factory-made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084a7bf986386908fb321828720a1437084f84c6/186_271_3826_2296/master/3826.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f56db9c60b6a4666637639c555bd3ee1 1240w","title":"arts council music funding unfair opera pop","story":"At the beginning of this year, Arts Council England boss Darren Henley launched what he hoped would be a “public conversation” about the future funding strategy for his organisation that allocates millions of pounds of public money to the arts. In the spirit of that conversation, UK Music – the umbrella body that represents the collective interests of the commercial music industry – decided this week to get the ball rolling.When I pointed out this disparity, things kicked off with our friends from the opera world. Passionate fans took to Twitter to voice their outrage at what they saw was an attack on opera – but it’s not anti-opera to highlight a stark unfairness. Opera makes a fantastic contribution to our cultural life, and I strongly back the council’s role in helping to maintain our place as a world leader. Some of the arguments that followed my intervention have been revealing and depressing. One person told me that it was the job of the Arts Council to fund “the arts”, and pop music should therefore get “not one penny” of public funding. Many others were under the misapprehension that popular music – perhaps we should call it “contemporary music” – means “commercially successful music” and is therefore highly lucrative. Certainly, there are those at the top who do amazingly well. But for every global star, there are thousands of hard-pressed artists, musicians and songwriters desperately trying to make ends meet with pop music. Average earnings in music are less than average earnings for workers in the UK economy as a whole, and that goes for musicians, whether they play in a string quartet or a four-piece rock band. One or two suggested that, given pop music has generated some fabulously wealthy stars, pop music doesn’t need public money. That’s as preposterous as saying that since Jonas Kaufmann has done alright for himself, opera can fend for itself. Music also has a key role to play in enabling social mobility, and the council’s Music Education Hubs – groups of organisations such as local authorities and schools that work together to create joined-up music education provisions – do help increase that. Worryingly, there is no clear plan in place for them after 2020, and venue closures have left aspiring musicians with even fewer places to hone their craft. That’s why arts council funding is required to expand rehearsal spaces and help safeguard grassroots venues.There is a strong body of evidence that young people who are engaged in their education through music, or who play a musical instrument, make greater progress at school and achieve better academic outcomes in core subjects including maths and English. And given that the creative industries are growing at twice the rate of the wider economy and are now worth £92bn to the UK, we also need to ensure young people are receiving an education in creative subjects and that we are equipping them with the relevant skills.When it comes to funding from Arts Council England, the status quo is simply not good enough. Its boss, Darren Henley, knows this. He said back in January: “There remains much to be done, especially in widening access to the arts to all socioeconomic groups and erse audiences, and ensuring that the workforce and leadership of the arts and culture world is representative of England in the 21st century.”I couldn’t agree with him more. But his vision will demand changes and some facing up to difficult realities, not least the current unfairness of music funding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c507bb1354046ab8568890b7b3727fed8110d6e/0_596_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=12266a8b48efdf76911992ec9db35e4e 2600w","title":"manic street preachers jobs meaning jeremy corbyn doesnt understand that resistance is useless","story":"Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield are seated in the latter’s hotel room in Marylebone, central London, ostensibly promoting the Manic Street Preachers’ forthcoming 14th album, Resistance Is Futile, but instead talking about the possibility of Manic Street Preachers splitting up. Wire says he finds the prospect “terrifying”, which is understandable: they have been in the band for 31 years – they formed at secondary school in Blackwood in south Wales – and neither of them seems to know what else they might do. “I can’t go and teach at the Cardiff Institute of Music, you know,” smiles Bradfield. “My first lecture on how to make it in the music business: ‘Piss everybody off, dress like your mum and learn how to play on the job.’ ‘Er … can we have a new lecturer, please?’”Nevertheless, they say, splitting up is a thought that has occurred to both of them in the four years since they last released an album, a trying period during which Wire’s elderly parents fell ill, his mother gravely so, and their Cardiff studio, Faster, was closed after the building that housed it was earmarked for redevelopment and demolished – its closure made the local news in Wales. The process of building a new one, Bradfield protests, turned him into “a low-rent version of what’s-his-fucking-name from Grand Designs”. “He would ring me up and go: ‘I’ve got a bit of bad news – steel prices have gone up,” sighs Wire, with the unmistakable air of a man who didn’t join a band in order to discuss supporting joists.To most observers, the Manics seem to have spent the past decade in the kind of creative Indian summer that has eluded most of their peers. They enjoyed their commercial zenith in the late 90s, when, as Wire disbelievingly points out, they were so big that a single such as The Masses Against the Classes, which opens with a sample of Noam Chomsky and ends with a quotation from Albert Camus’ book The Rebel, could knock Westlife’s Seasons in the Sun off No 1. If they have never recaptured that high point, the past 10 years have still come replete with gold albums, arena tours and critical acclaim. That last record, Futurology, in particular was widely hailed as one of the best records the band has made. But Bradfield says he has found himself wondering if the Manics still had an audience – an odd thing to worry about given the size of the venues they still play, but as he says, the band were always “fucking obsessed with a desire to be huge”.“It’s dictated by role models, icons, whatever you want to call them,” Wire says. “Music used to be the leader in terms of that, everything about the way we looked growing up was about searching out how to look like those kind of people. Now they’re getting it from avenues that I can’t comprehend why they’d want to.” He sighs. “The emptiness of it. Actually, I feel a certain sense of pity, because I think our youth was so definite and tangible and exciting and full of space to dream and magic and all those kind of ephemeral things. Whereas now, it’s just ratcheted at you at such a fucking speed. And we all know, because we’ve all got kids, and you try to kind of … not influence them, but pass on things that made your life magical, and they just seem completely fucking irrelevant. It’s not nostalgia, that’s a key thing it’s actually things just disappearing. It’s like the NME closing, that was the worst thing about it: it’s just another nail, telling you music is less relevant.” Nevertheless, he says, “the one thing I know for certain, in this world of absolute doubt and uncertainty, is that when the three of us get in the studio, there is still a magic there”.Hence they didn’t split up, and while Resistance Is Futile certainly doesn’t shy away from addressing the band’s doubts – they are there in everything from its title to its cover photo, featuring “one of the last samurai warriors – someone who knows his time is over thanks to the coming of the gun” – it arrives filled with brashly anthemic songs that deal in what Wire calls “ecstatic miserablism … effervescent melancholy”.The latter’s story keys into another of Wire’s obsessions about the internet era: that nothing is ever truly secret, that everyone’s lives are constantly documented and held up to public scrutiny. “One of the greatest things Francis Bacon ever said was that you self-realised,” he says. “There was a period of five years in his life, literally no one knows what the fuck he did. He destroyed everything he painted, there were rumours he was an interior decorator, he was in Berlin … Just no one knows what went on for that period, and that can never happen again, that self-realisation where you really form yourself through isolation and scarcity and ideas. I actually feel sorry for the generations coming after us, because of that. How can you do it? Everything is there, laid out for you to be embarrassed by when you’re older, without realising. All our embarrassing songs that we wrote when we were 15, you know, thank fuck no one heard them. So there’s humiliation, as well, that idea of one false step … If you look back at me and Richey at the start, fuck me, we’d have been killed today. I dread to think what I would have put James and Sean through, because some of the interviews are just … there’s so much talk, and it’s only by the end that we talk any sense. But that was the process, wasn’t it, of just going through all that stuff.”There is also a considerable amount of fretting about politics, which seems faintly surprising: given the band’s past political allegiances to Tony Benn and Arthur Scargill, I had assumed they would be quite gung-ho for Jeremy Corbyn, but apparently not. “I’m coming around to him a lot more, but not gung-ho, no,” says Bradfield. “I’m not one of those people that goes on about the liberal elite in London, but I don’t think he understands what makes the working classes tick outside of London and that is just hardcore industries. We’ve operated at our optimum as people when jobs give us meaning, and in the post-industrial hinterlands, he doesn’t understand that. I remember somebody at a meeting down in south Wales, an old guy, ex-miner, wanted his son to have a proper, real, blue-collar job, and he was saying: ‘What do you expect us to do, Mr Corbyn, make fucking love spoons out of hemp?’ I don’t think Jezza gets it, I don’t think he connects with people on that level, which is part of the reason we’re having political problems in Wales.”Wire says he’s “completely baffled by my own political vacuum” since Brexit: “A lot of it’s just about political intelligence, the frustration where I think we grew up in a time when there was a lot of political intelligence on both sides, to be honest. Now … there’s never any answers, it’s just statement after statement of opposing vitriol, you know, which I just … I just can’t see a middle way at the moment.”And Bradfield and Wire go off on a lengthy tangent about politics: they talk, as much to each other as to me, about Tony Benn’s notion of the EU as “a gentleman’s club for millionaires” and how the remain campaign failed because it didn’t make enough of the EU’s failings and the need to reform it, whether or not the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is “an old-school totalitarian communist” (this, I should point out, is a phrase Wire uses with approval, rather than censure), and the proposed 2016 closure of the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot. They don’t, it has to be said, sound much like an irrelevant band stuck for things to say.“There is a sense of a massive fun and excitement being in our band,” says Wire. “Every record we’ve made recently, whether you like them or not, they’ve all been convincing. It’s still full of vitality. You can’t really fake that. We have to be completely committed to this.” He smiles. “At our age, if you’re not, then it’s fucking over.”Resistance is Futile is released on Columbia on 13 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e144f45ff996d4e2fb94f538270728b76800ad5/0_0_3500_2502/master/3500.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c3c84ec8d5b5cea2d44d5d32391037 1010w","title":"all women rallye aicha des gazelles du maroc","story":"The world’s largest all-female motorsport competition draws women from across the globe to the western Sahara desert. Welcome to the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles du MarocOver the course of an average year, the Sahara desert plays host to a wide variety of automotive sporting events, but none like the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles du Maroc.The off-road rallies typically held in this vast, desolate automotive playground utilize modern GPS and mapping technology, last only a couple of days and predominantly, if not entirely, consist of male competitors. Every year during the last week of March, however, 330 adventurous women from nearly every corner of the planet gather in Morocco for one full week of competition designed by women, for women. For the rally’s competitors, referred to as ‘Gazelles,’ points are deducted for requesting mechanical assistance or erging from the most direct route between checkpoints, meaning they are penalized for sidestepping any of the obstacles the desert throws their way. Those who have never been to the Sahara might imagine a relatively consistent landscape – endless miles of flat, sandy terrain – but in the desert’s northwestern edge the scenery can change dramatically from one mile to the next. From behind the wheel of an off-road vehicle drivers will witness the ersity of the terrain in rapid succession, the rocky ground below their tires switching from slippery sand to bumpy pebbles to jagged rocks to towering mountains and back again with little indication of what challenge lies around the next bend. One moment they’re driving through herds of wild camel grazing in the flat grasslands, the next they’re climbing wave after wave of tsunami-sized sand dunes that give little traction even to tires built specially for desert driving. “I wanted to make an intelligent rally, rather than an adrenaline rally something that went beyond just putting your foot on the accelerator and advancing along in a straight line,” said the event’s founder, Dominique Serra, speaking through a French translator in her mobile office one evening midway through the competition. “I had to come up with a concept that would prevent people from driving fast.” Serra first conceived of the rally, now in its 28th year, as a member of France’s largest employer association, MEDEF. “Women were not being represented in the automotive industry, and I was asked to find a way to empower these women,” she explained. The first Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles was held in 1990, and consisted of nine French teams of two. In its 2018 iteration the rally welcomed 165 teams from 16 countries in four different vehicle classes, with a majority competing in the 4x4truck category. In addition, nine teams competed this year in dune buggies, five teams raced each other in crossovers and five more drove fully electric cars through a modified course that allowed for sufficient charging time between legs. Even with a modified course those driving electric vehicles had to overcome the significant challenges associated with traversing off road terrain in vehicles designed primarily for urban driving, but Serra says their incorporation last year was a natural next step for what she labels a “responsible rally.” In 2010, the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles became the first automotive competition to obtain the international environmental certification in accordance with the ISO 14001 (2004) standard, and those painstaking efforts are plainly visible at the ‘bivouac’ or base camp where competitors mingle, eat and set up camp each night. All garbage produced there is either recycled or incinerated, with food waste donated to local farmers as animal feed and plastic water bottles converted into building material in local villages. “They take the empty water bottles and fill them with sand to use as building blocks,” said Serra. “All of the C02 emissions are offset. Even the mechanic’s area, which is a potential source of pollution, every measure is taken so that not a drop of oil hits the ground.”The medical teams that support the rally also provide free consultations and assistance to villagers in this remote region of Morocco, many of who have no other access to health services of any kind. The organization is also involved in local initiatives that help build schools, daycare services, provide job training to women, donate wheelchairs and glasses and much more. As a direct result of these efforts the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is the only event of its kind to bear the Moroccan royal coat of arms, which can be found on the left shoulder of each competitor’s uniform vest. “There are a huge number of motor sports that go on in Morocco – this is the world’s playground for off road races – but this is the only one that has that level of respect from the host country,” said Serra, who was awarded the Order of Ouissam Alaouite, the country’s equivalent to America’s Legion of Merit or France’s Legion of Honour, by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI in 2013. “He follows the rally every year, and he appreciates the efforts we’ve made for Morocco.”While the event officially kicked off with an inspection and opening ceremony celebration in Nice, France, on 16 March, competitors have been preparing themselves and their cars for months. “The first part of the job, which is the biggest one, is to find sponsors,” French racer Julie Kohlman said. “You meet people, you talk to them about the event, you try to get money to register for the event, so that’s the first part.” While the event is primarily comprised of amateur drivers Kohlmann explains that they need to think and act like professionals in order to raise the nearly €15,000 (approximately $18,000) entry fee on top of the significant investments that needs to be put into their vehicles.“You need to have a good car, you need to prepare the car, and you need to know exactly what you want to do with the car,” she said, adding that each team is really comprised of three competitors, “the third being the car”.While the competitors are left to old-school navigation techniques behind the scenes a complex machine is plotting and tracking their every move. “From here we can know the position of each Gazelle team on the terrain, and we receive their position on a radar screen, like the ones used in aviation traffic control,” said Serge Barbieux, the rally’s assistant sport director, sitting behind a radar screen inside a trailer at basecamp. “A system installed in each of the cars, called Aerotrack, sends us the position of the car every five minutes.”While the onboard GPS system doesn’t reveal any information to the Gazelles about their position, it can be used to call for mechanical or medical assistance if needed. Barbieux explains that there’s only one situation when the system is used to communicate with drivers unprompted. “If we see a car getting close to the Algerian border we phone them through the Aerotrack satellite box and we tell them just to check their navigation again,” he said. An air traffic controller in Lyon, France, the rest of the year, Barbieux sees a lot of similarities between his day job and his work at the rally. “It’s very similar to watch vehicles moving on a radar screen, taking care of them like I do with aircrafts, just without being able to help them,” he said. Barbieux also assists in testing the course before the competitors arrive, and helps conduct the day and a half long navigation training program that each Gazelle must complete in order to participate. “I train them before they come, but when I’m here I’m just on mute,” he said. When designing the course Barbieux explains that organizers need to set up multiple checkpoints and plot multiple paths for each of the six legs of the competition, which includes two marathon legs that  two days each. The variation in routes ensures that competitors are not unable to follow tracks or other cars to the next checkpoint, nor can they practice their designated route in advance. In fact, competitors are only provided the coordinates of their checkpoints at the daily 5am roll call. While speed and timing is not a factor in the scoring checkpoints close at 7pm each day, providing some level of urgency to an otherwise unhurried competition. “It’s hard slowing down, because we’re used to speeding up,” said Keanna Erickson-Chang, a 23-year-old American professional rally competitor who is more accustomed to racing the clock. Though speed is less of a factor Erickson-Chang says it does provide an advantage. “We still want to keep our time up because as the sun gets higher the sand gets looser,” she explained, while releasing air from her tires to help increase traction in preparation for the slippery patch of sand dunes that sit between her and the next checkpoint. Since its inception Serra says there has been interest from men wanting to compete in a compass-and-map style rally, and this past November they finally got that opportunity when first annual Gazelles and Men rally welcomed mixed-gender and all male teams for the first time.“It’s exactly like the Gazelles, and you have a lot of former Gazelles that want to compete with their husbands,” said former competitor and current Gazelle and Men project manager, Maud Garnier. “It’s very funny because we were thinking wow, woman and husband in the same car, it will be very difficult, maybe we should have a ‘orce’ button on the dashboard.” All jokes aside Garnier says the event was a success, and she’s proud to report that no orce filings directly resulted. “It’s the first time a women’s rally has served as an example to a men’s event usually it’s the other way around,” adds Serra. While there is a designated E-Gazelles category with five competitors the rally actually included six electric vehicles this year. Car number 313 competed in the crossover section, and the vehicle – a modified Renault Zoe, Europe’s most popular electric vehicle – was piloted by two of the car manufacturer’s engineers. Team 313 ultimately placed second amongst the five crossover competitors. The team was followed throughout the competition by a support truck carrying emergency batteries, but the team would have been penalized for charging the vehicle more than once per day. As a result Poisson says she and her teammate had to consider not only the most direct path between checkpoints, but also the most battery conserving. “We’re not thinking in kilometers, we’re thinking in kilowatts,” she said. Serra hopes to see the event become entirely electric one day, adding another point to the laundry list of reasons why the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is unlike anything else in the sport.

Heather Knight had won the toss and elected to bat, but opener Tammy Beaumont, making her 50th ODI appearance, had managed just four when she edged Jhulan Ghoswami behind. Danielle Wyatt also failed to make an impact, playing the seamer onto the stumps for only 17, leaving England in trouble at 27 for two. Knight then managed 36, before she was caught at long-on by Harmanpreet Kaur off Deepti Sharma, while Natalie Sciver was bowled by Poonam Yadav four just four. But a career-best 94 from wicketkeeper Amy Jones lifted England to 201 for nine – though she fell just short of her century, run out in the final over by Rajeshwari Gayakwad. England had earned a deciderby bowling India out in less than 38 overs to win the second match of the series, but though Jemmiah Rodrigues and Veda Krishnamurthy were both out cheaply to Anya Shrubsole inside the opening seven overs, Smriti Mandhana, Sharma and captain Mithali Raj all hit half-centuries as the target was achieved with 4.4 overs to spare.There was brief alarm for the hosts when Mandhana, who had pushed the team on alongside her captain, had to retire unwell on 53, having faced 67 deliveries. But Raj, whose half-century was her 50th in ODIs, saw her team home she finished on 74 not out, while alongside her, Sharma remained undefeated on 54.

Whether he will be disqualified or not remains to be seen – England have appealed. Elsewhere, another great day for the hosts, although they were denied a clean sweep in the beach volleyball. Another gold in the pool for Jack Laugher in the ing, and an appearance from Usain Bolt to boot. Thanks for your company. Here’s our report from the Gold Coast:Melissa Wu takes the final medal of day eight, edging out Meaghen Benfeito, of Canada, and England’s Lois Toulson, who takes bronze. Wu’s score of 360.40 is enough to take gold from Benfeito, who registered 359.75 points. It’s not been dull on the Gold Coast! Day eight is almost done and dusted, with just the women’s 10m platform to be finalised. The images of Zharnel Hughes being told about his disqualification, a few minutes after completing a full lap of honour, was absolutely excruciating. The medal ceremony has been postponed until tomorrow, as the panel assess England’s appeal. That was a stonking run by Langford, though. Meanwhile, England are reportedly appealing Zharnel Hughes’s disqualification ...No drama, this time. Wycliffe Kinyamal wins fair and square. Kyle Langford, of England, is shaking his head, gutted after taking a close silver. Kinyamal gets over in 1.45.11min, while Luke Mathews bags bronze for the host nation. In the ing, the 10m platform is coming to its climax. Meaghan Benfeito looks set to claim gold for Canada, while Melissa Wu, of Australia and Lois Toulson, the girlfriend of fellow er Jack Laugher who has two golds to his name already on the Gold Coast, could yet also get on the podium. Back to the men’s 800m final ...Confusion reigns, with Zharnel Hughes still out on his lap of honour ... who’s going to tell him? You or me? He will be gutted.But, hang on a minute ... Zharnel Hughes has been disqualifed! He’s been penalised for running right on the edge of the lane, impeding into Jereem Richard’s lane, and not necessarily for his arms appearing to make contact with the Trinidad athlete. That’s gutting for Hughes, after a corking run. The one positive is that Leon Reid sneaks on to the podium, for bronze.Zharnel Hughes steamrollers towards the line, he almost loses it at the last as he tired but an incredible race by the 22-year-old, born in Anguilla, means he clinches England’s 29th gold of these Games in some style. Trinidad’s Jereem Richards is neck and neck alongside him, with his arms flailing. Aaron Brown, of Canada, finishes third. Richards did not look best pleased with Hughes about that ... The men’s 200m final is on the way now. Usain Bolt, who holds the world record 19.19sec for this discipline, is among those watching on. Zharnel Hughes, of England, and Leon Reid, representing Northern Ireland, both run at the Carrara Stadium. It’s always a showpiece event ...Dani Stevens smashes the field with a Games’ record of 68.26m, ahead of India’s Seema Punia and Navjeet Dhillon to sit top of the podium.Before the men’s 200m final and 800m final, let’s take a look at the ing. In the women’s 10 platform, Canada are looking good, with Benfeito and Toth leading the way, ahead of England’s Robyn Birch. Shaunae Miller-Uibo gets over the line fastest, in 22.09sec, setting a new Commonwealth Games record, while Thompson, the Olympic champion, misses out but her Jamaican compatriot, Shericka Jackson nabs silver. England’s Asher-Smith gets bronze in a great 200m field.The women’s 200m final is imminent, followed by the mens’ event. The field for the women’s event includes Dina Asher-Smith, as well as Bianca Williams representing England. Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson will probably start as the favourite after a blistering heat, finishing in 21.66sec.Pavan and Humana-Paredes, the top-ranked pairing in the world, deny Australia a double win on the sand on day eight. Kurtis Marschall with a beautiful third and final jump to clear 5.70m. He celebrates deliriously, high-fiving fellow competitors and his coach along the way in front of 30,000-odd Aussies. Great scenes. Shawn Barber, of Canada ends up clinching silver, with Cutts taking bronze. A great moment for England’s Sophie Hahn, up on the podium, as she collects her gold medal from the T38 100m after a bursting sprint earlier. Still to come? The women’s 200m final, men’s 200m final and the men’s 800m final, so plenty of medals still up for grabs. Elsewhere, there’s the 10m platform women’s final while the beach volleyball is coming towards a close, with Canada looking good for victory in the gold-medal match. They hold a very slender 1-0 lead on the sand.Christabel Nettey takes top spot, with a mammoth first leap ultimately securing victory. Brooke Stratton earns silver, and England’s Shara Proctor a bronze, with the latter pulling out, presumably through injury, of having a final jump, a last tilt towards toppling Nettey.In the pole vault, Shaw Barber cannot clear 5.70m. Can Kurtis Marschall? Elsewhere, we’re in the final round of the long jump, with Lorraine Ugen registering a mighty 6.69m, to move up to fourth for now. KJT storms her heat, with a lightning time of 23.57sec, leaving the rest of the field in her wake. That’s over 1,000 priceless points to take into tomorrow, when the heptathlon comes to a climax.The heptathlon continues, with the final event of day one on the track. Katarina Johnson-Thompson is among those looking for a timely boost in the 200m heats at the Carrara Stadium. Here we go ...On the beach, Australia trail Canada early on the women’s finals after losing the first set. Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar have it all to do. Meanwhile, England captain Alex Danson has been speaking after a galling defeat to New Zealand in the hockey semis. “We are devastated,” Danson says. “We played a fantastic game and I’m so proud of how we came out. We have to hold our head and come out fighting for the bronze.”It is the end of the Commonwealth road for England’s Luke Cutts, he fails to clear 5.55m but his hair-themed colleague, Shaw Barber, of Canada, clears that height with his third and final attempt, to leave him in with a sniff of a medal. Adam Hague, another Englishman, also fails to clear 5.55m. Cutts is line for a bronze medal in the pole vault as it stands but he may get bumped down the pecking order.Marschall goes one better! He’s just cleared 5.55m to jump to the top of the leaderboard. In the long jump, Shara Proctor has registered an impressive 6.75m but it’s Canada, through Christabel Nettey, who leads with 6.84m.Back towards the track and field, and the pole vault, where Kurtis Marschall, the 20-year-old Australian, has just quite comfortably cleared the 5.45m. He’s all smiles. Adam Hague, of England, also flies clear.New Zealand have done it! They prevail against England on penalties, winning 2-1, with Stacey Michelsen’s superb, dinked finish eventually getting the better of Maddie Hinch in goal. NZ will compete in the final for gold or silver, while England will have to settle for a place in the bronze-medal match.England and New Zealand are level pegging, but if the Kiwis can score with their fifth and final penalty then they’ll progress to the final ...England are up and running, Martin scores the first ... These are penalties with a twist, Maddie Hinch, the England keeper is playing the role of Jerzy Dudek ... no one has scored yet.In the hockey, it’s quite the stalemate between England and New Zealand, with Maddie Hinch making a stunning save to deny the Kiwis victory. Normal time ends 0-0, after a breathless match, which means we are heading for another penalty shootout. When England ousted NZ in Rio, that was also on penalties. “Both teams will have done huge amounts of homework,” says Kate Richardson-Walsh, the former skipper. Two medals in two days! Jack Laugher wins by 66.70 points, smashing the 3m springboard in the pool. Phillipe Gagne takes second for Canada, James Connor earns Australia bronze. Ross Haslam, one of the brothers from Sheffield, has to settle for fourth and Heatly, of Scotland, fifth.Not as fast as his qualifying time but gold for Ndodomzi Ntutu. Langenhoven makes it a South Africa one-two – they are speed merchants, aren’t they – while Malaysia earn bronze.In the ing, Jack Laugher has established an unassailable lead, he’s a few minutes away from a fourth Commonwealth Games title. Laugher’s on 519.40, way ahead of second-place James Connor on 438.00. In the pole vault, things are looking good for Luke Cutts, who has cleared a season’s best 5.45m to stay in medal territory.Ah, drat. Shara Proctor’s first attempt in the long jump final ends in a foul. Still 0-0 as such, and a helluva way to go yet. Lorraine Ugen set a 6.35m while Jazmin Sawyers is up next ...“The Pocket Rocket does it again, in blistering form – absolutely unstoppable,” emails Chris Page, of the electric Sophie Hahn. “She has the full set of titles at this distance.”Sophie Hahn earns England’s first gold on this track at Carrara. “I’m so, so happy,” she says. “The key thing is to be consistent.” Australian Rhiannon Clarke took silver and Olivia Breen claimed Wales’ 25th medal at these Games after earning bronze. Now, for the long jump final, with Shara Proctor among those competing ...Katarina Johnson-Thompson looks pretty nonplussed out there, throwing a 11.54m in her third and final throw. Whether that’s going to be enough to keep her dreams of gold alive remains to be seen. In terms of the shot put itself, that score sees her way down in ninth. After three events, she’s down in third and with it all to do if she wants more than that.In the ing, Jack Laugher is on top spot as it stands, with a 345.20. James Heatly, of Scotland, had jumped into second, only for Phillipe Gagne, of Canada, to go one better. Matthew Carter is trying to redeem himself after that earlier mistake in the pool. The Aussies breeze past Scotland 21-12 to clinch triples gold. The Scots take silver, while England beat Canada for bronze. Kyron McMaster earns the island country’s first medal of these Games, running a time of 48.25sec. The Bahamas take silver, Jaheel Hyde bags bronze for Jamaica. It is some story for McMaster, the 21-year-old who lost his coach, Xavier Samuels, last year, who died in Hurricane Irma. “I still think and talk about him every day,” McMaster said. “I even got a tattoo on my inner arm made of his favourite phrase, which was ‘guidance’. Every day I look at it and it acts as motivation.”Jack Green, of England, takes a very respectable fourth. “I run for a living which is ridiculous,” Green says. “I’m very lucky to do what I do.”It’s not massive, Johnson-Thompson appears to play it a little safe but she gets the white flag and registers a 11.36m. She could do with finding the 12m mark in her third and final throw but she’s still primed for a tilt at a podium finish in the heptathlon, which finishes on Friday. Here comes KJT, for take two in the shot put ...A couple of untimely errors in the ing has left Jack Haslam and Matthew Carter with work to do. A false start for the former and a messy exit from the somersault means Laugher is sitting pretty at the top. Janieve Russell runs a slick 54.33sec. Eilidh Doyle takes silver for Scotland while Wenda Nel, of South Africa, earns bronze. Russell had to settle for bronze four years but this time she has gone not one better but taken the top prize. A great run by Russell, the 24-year-old. In the ing, after two of six attempts: Laugher scores 94.50 with his second e (3.5 reverse somersaults) to take a big lead. James Connor of Australia and Ross Haslam are in second on 141.90. James Heatly is 4th on 140.70, with Yona Knight-Wisdom just behind. Ah, that’s not the start Johnson-Thompson was after in the shot put, fouling with her first effort (of three). Time for the women’s 400m hurdles ...In the pool, Jack Laugher has work to do. Matthew Carter, the 17-year-old Australian leads the way with a stonking 81.60 score. In the shot put, the heptathlon is back under way, with Niamh Emerson registering a 11.86m, with Katarina Johnson-Thompson and co still to come. “How’s England getting on in women’s triples lawn bowls medal match?” tweets Jennifer. They lead Canada 16-12 after 14 ends. They led 10-3 after seven ends but have been pegged back a little. It’s looking good though in the bronze-medal match for Sian Honnor’s team. Jack Haslam kickstarts the 3m springboard, with a healthy score of 63.00. He is one of three Englishman in the final, alongside Jack Laugher and his brother, Ross. In the hockey, it’s still 0-0, with three minutes left of the 1st. In the lawn bowls triples, Australia are heading for a 60th gold. There is plenty of athletics, all manner of medals on the way but first England are under way against New Zealand in the hockey. A few minutes into the first period, England are enjoying a decent spell of possession.Everybody’s limbering up, from Jack Laugher, ready for his 3m springboard final in the pool to England’s hockey team, who are preparing to do battle – again – with New Zealand in the women’s semis. Alex Danson will make her 300th international appearance in that duel. The 10m platform complete the day, as far as ing is concerned anyway. On Danson, the 32-year-old from Southampton, her former team-mate and captain Kate Richardson-Walsh tweeted: “A true inspiration, authentic leader and best striker in the world. A lioness on the pitch, her desire to better herself has never lessened.” High praise indeed. So, the men’s pole vault final will be upon us in no time. Adam Hague and Luke Cutts will compete for England, but Australia’s Kurtis Marshall will enter as the favourite. Another event, wrestling, has finished for the day, with joy for Georgina Nelthorpe and Curtis Dodge, who both bag bronze medals. Meanwhile, here’s a story to warm the cockles a little:As thought, Kumar Sushil notches another success for India at the Carrara Sports Arena, this time in the men’s 74kg freestyle. He batters South Africa’s Johannes Botha, to clinch victory inside all of 90 seconds. Lovely jubbly. A little earlier, Curtis Dodge bagged a bronze for Wales, with a win over Nigeria’s Assizecourt. KJT speaks about being numero uno. “I’m never normally in this position, normally heptathlon’s on the first day or one of the first events,” she says, given her lead after two events and the shot up next. “I’ve been itching to get going in the village, watching everybody. I like being the favourite because that means everyone rates you and I’m enjoying it.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c5fc2b42591243e6292fc83f8a97ed78807b57/206_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e0aab9f557ca706d7b7ecce5770d94e1 1240w","title":"racism slurs reddit post ceo steve huffman","story":"Steve Huffman says communities can set own guidelines, but racism is permitted on wider site as people have ‘different beliefs’Racist slurs are permitted on Reddit, says the popular social news and discussion site’s chief executive, Steve Huffman.Within a discussion thread that followed the publishing of the site’s transparency report on Russian propaganda, Huffman, in reply to a question from a Reddit user about whether “open racism, including slurs” are allowed on the platform, said their use was not against Reddit’s rules.“On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs,” said Huffman under his username spez. “This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users’ actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.”Hoffman’s controversial response explains why outwardly racist and high-profile communities have been allowed to operate on a site that has 542 million monthly visitors.“Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules,” Hoffman said.Reddit’s approach to offensive behaviour has evolved from a position of actively banning users for hate speech to one allowing it under the guise of free speech.In July 2015 Hoffman said of banning hate speech: “I don’t think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I’m sure our thinking will continue to evolve.”That evolution appears to have created a light-touch moderation policy that permits racism and hate speech unless otherwise banned by the particular subreddit’s rules. Reddit will still take action when there is evidence of direct threats or incitement of violence. But some high-profile subeddits, including The_Donald, have been accused of participating in the organisation of events such as the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, with seemingly little consequence."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

The youngsters are still expected at the gate on Sunday evening or at the latest Monday morning and are not allowed to go outside before Friday,” he said.“We are also looking into extending the free weekend by focusing more on the lessons. The army is even studying whether the boarding regime can be relaxed or even lifted. Then the recruits who live near the military school or the barracks can go home in the evening.”The defence ministry has been on a major recruitment drive, but it has been a hard sell because of pension reforms, poor job prospects on leaving the army and a demand in recent years for soldiers to patrol the streets of Belgium’s major cities under the counter-terrorism operation Vigilant Guardian.Danny Lams, a former paratrooper who chairs a veterans’ organisation representing Ostend and the areas bordering the Netherlands, nevertheless condemned the army’s plans to allow soldiers to sleep at home.“That’s how you grow a defence of nothing, an army that you cannot count on. You do not go to a war zone with men who miss their mama,” he said.“We used to sleep on the cold ground under a leaky tarpaulin. We wanted to serve our country.

In general, the line is used by both sides,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. The US has threatened retaliation after a chemical attack at the weekend on Douma, a town in eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus.On Thursday, Donald Trump appeared to row back on the prospect of an imminent strike with a tweet that said action could take place “very soon or not so soon at all”.On Wednesday he had warned Russia to “get ready” for a missile attack on its ally Syria, suggesting imminent retaliation. But on Thursday he wrote that he “never said when an attack on Syria would take place”. President Emmanuel Macron said France, a possible partner in US action, had proof the Syrian government carried out the chemical attack and would decide whether to strike back when all the necessary information had been gathered.The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, said western threats to strike were based on “lies”, and that the west was lashing out after it lost its “bet” on opposition forces in eastern Ghouta.The deconfliction hotline was established in 2016 between US central command in Qatar and its Russian equivalent in Syria. It is used to prevent a direct clash between US and Russian forces in the Syrian conflict, where Russia is backing the Assad government and the US supports some opposition forces.Dozens of Russian mercenaries and other Assad supporters were killed at a Kurdish base earlier this year after an ill-fated assault backed by US airpower. The deconfliction line was used during that clash.On Thursday, Peskov sidestepped more detailed questions about the discussions over the expected US strike, saying only that “both sides are using the line”.In April 2017 the Russian military threatened to close the line after Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airbase involved in a chemical attack. Moscow did not follow up the threat.At the United Nations security council earlier this week, both Russia and the group of western allies led by the US voted against each other’s proposals for setting up a body dedicated to investigating the repeated use of poison gas in Syria.On Thursday, the Russian foreign ministry called for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to deploy specialists before an expected missile strike by US forces, possibly supported by France and the UK.“Any delay in visiting the location of the alleged incident could lead to another reckless move of Washington, which already fired missiles on Syria’s Shayrat airbase in April 2017 in violation of the UN charter and international law,” the ministry said in a statement. There were signs that Moscow was already preparing for a missile strike. Satellite images released by the Israeli company ImageSat International showed ships had been deployed from Russia’s naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus. Russian media, including the respected business daily Kommersant, reported on Thursday that Russian officials were in contact with the Pentagon over the potential strikes and expected to receive coordinates of the targets before any attack.

The report, jointly published by Safefood, the HSE and Healthy Ireland, warns the empty calories found in processed food are leading to dangerously high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer.It indicates that 19 per cent of the average weekly food shop goes on highly processed “treat” foods like crisps, chocolates and sweets. By contrast only 10 per cent of the weekly spend goes on fruit and just 7 per cent is spent on vegetables. Families with children spent on average €1,037 last year on highly-processed food like crisps, chocolate and sweets and just €521 on fruit and only €346 on vegetables, according to the research. Chocolate and sweets made up for the largest portion of the treat spending pie with €228 on this category. On €199, sugary drinks was in second place while the spend on biscuits was put at €161 and the amount of money spent on crisps was €129.The research only includes supermarket shopping trips and does not account for purchases in outlets such as garage forecourts, cafes or cinemas, suggesting that the spend on treats is even higher than the report has found. Separate research published earlier this year found that almost 100,000 children living on the island of Ireland today will die prematurely due to overweight and obesity.“These foods which are full of empty calories are now a staple in our weekly shop,” said Dr Cliodhna Foley-Nolan, director of human health and nutrition at Safefood.“We accept them as the norm in our children’s daily diet and they are not seen as a real treat any more.” She said the balance was “all wrong” and families were “under-consuming the vital nutrients in fruit and vegetables. “Undoubtedly this level of consumption by families is contributing to our dangerous levels of overweight, type 2 diabetes and cancer.”She said highly-processed foods “were everywhere, at all times of the year and are so cheap. it’s no wonder that we are finding it difficult to not overindulge our children and ourselves. Regarding being healthy as a family, 40 per cent of parents² cited trying to cut back on sweets, ice-cream and other treats as the number one barrier to healthy eating.“This research confirms the need for parents and all those who care for children to work together to improve children’s eating habits” said Minister for State Catherine Byrne. “Not only are these so-called treat foods and drinks mostly high in fat, sugar and salt and contribute to overweight and obesity but equally important is the fact that if children fill up on these foods, they don’t have an appetite for the nutritious foods they need for good health and wellbeing.”She said the such foods should not be every day foods and only consumed once or twice a week at most and in small amounts. “Eating vegetables, fruit and salads are healthier choices and lay down the foundation of good eating habits for life. This campaign is by parents and for parents, and the motto is try and try again - parenting is tough but we know parents are tougher.”The new research was carried out to coincide with the latest phase f a five-year public health awareness campaign from Safefood, the HSE and Healthy Ireland labelled START. The campaign is encouraging families to take the first step towards a healthier lifestyle for their children by supporting them to start with “one daily win” and to persist with the changes, no matter how difficult they become.The “START” campaign has been created to help parents get started and build momentum by achieving one daily win for example, having fruit after school as a snack. Not buying treats in the weekly shop means there are less of them to have at home. And by linking treats to real occasions like family birthdays and events helps children to understand the value of what is a treat and that it’s not an everyday thing.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458513.1523469092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government looks to push closer german ties ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman foreign minister Heiko Maas (above left) will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet Tánaiste Simon Coveney, while German  finance minister Olaf Scholz (above centre) and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe will meet in Berlin. Photograph: Fabrizio BenschReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will today unveil proposals for closer Irish-German ties when Germany’s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, visits Dublin.The plan is expected to involve a new consulate in Frankfurt, a joint Irish-German economic council, closer political and ministerial exchanges and a greater arts push co-ordinated by a new cultural director in Berlin.The Irish Embassy in Berlin has since December been consulting on proposals to boost Ireland’s profile in Germany ahead of Brexit and next year’s 90th anniversary of the first Irish diplomatic mission to the country. Germany is not just first among equals in the EU: it is Ireland’s second-largest source of inward investment, third-largest source of foreign guests, fourth-largest trading partner and fifth largest food export market.Bedded down in the Government’s wider plan to double Ireland’s global footprint by 2025, proposals raised during German consultations include an award recognising people who contribute to Irish-German relations and greater outreach to emigrant Irish families and second- and third-generation Irish.The Department of Foreign Affairs plan is an attempt to adapt to new post-Brexit realities but also to catch up with Irish people voting with their feet. In the six years to 2016, the Irish community in Germany grew by 40 per cent to 14,000 and continues to expand.The plan is likely to make clear that a reboot of Irish relations must engage closely with Angela Merkel’s federal government but also with the decentralised Germany beyond Berlin: 16 federal states, many with populations and economies dwarfing most EU members, which have huge autonomy in everything from investment to education policy.It is expected to propose regular German visits by Irish officials to co-ordinate bilateral and EU policy.Closer ties will hinge on Irish officials identifying and implementing useful projects with Germany – from cybersecurity co-operation to arms control and development co-operation in Africa.A key factor in realising the policy review is funding. An embassy survey flagged culture as the single most visible platform for Ireland in Germany. Yet, even as Ireland’s economy recovers, its annual cultural spend in Germany is a quarter that of Denmark and a fifth of Finland’s, two similarly sized countries.While those countries have dedicated cultural spaces, the report is likely to recommend rebranding the existing Embassy space as an “Ireland House” for cultural events.Frankfurt has emerged as the likely home of a new permanent consulate, given it is home to the European Central Bank, major European banks, the IDA and Tourism Ireland.The plan also underlines how selling Ireland, its products and services to Germany cannot happen unless those doing so speak German. With that in mind, the plan identifies a need for a new German language-learning push in Ireland and renewal of German-Irish education links.German officials have welcomed Ireland’s strategic review as timely. Mr Maas will use his first visit to Dublin – before heading on to London – to underline Berlin’s backing for Ireland’s Brexit position.Berlin officials see the Republic as a litmus test for Brexit: if it can be made work with minimum disruption on the island, it will work for the EU27.While Mr Maas is in Dublin, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will hold his first meeting in Berlin with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz. As well as discussing post-Brexit EU budget planning, Mr Donohoe will sound out the Social Democrat minister on whether to expect continuity or change from Berlin on the EU tax debate which, in Germany, has focused on Ireland.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458482.1523467615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit is no excuse to start misunderstanding the eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit: the UK’s departure has led to a renewed spirit of togetherness among the remaining EU members. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGettyThere’s an inescapable link between the discussion of Brexit and that of the future ethos and shape of the EU of 27. But does that necessary link make it an opportunity to be embraced? Should we be seizing the moment to refashion and redesign the architecture of the European Union?We’ve got to change the treaties, if only to take the United Kingdom references out. So why not a full reworking, to recognise and institutionalise the “reality” that the UK has articulated, the need for a different kind of union, a vision shared by others? How about two unions in one? Concentric circles, with the most committed integrationists in the middle, and others, like the UK, in an outer association of those interested only in economic ties?Or so argues Federico Fabbrini, professor of European law and head of Dublin City University’s Brexit institute.But mention treaty changes – even the word referendum – to Irish officials or politicians and you see them age. Treaty changes necessitated by the specific requirements of Brexit are one thing an opening of the whole can of worms entirely another.Fabbrini was in Brussels on Monday to host, with the Irish representation to the EU, a well-attended Brexit seminar that heard assessments of the state of play in negotiations from commissioner Phil Hogan, a member of the EU task force, and a senior Irish diplomat.Fabbrini’s lively contribution rehearsed an argument he has made in several articles. It’s not Euroscepticism but a “realist” Europhile’s concern that the European integration project may be stalled irrevocably. And primarily by failing to address profound differences about the finalité, or end state, of union integration. Unanimity means the slowest mover can determine the pace of advance.But giving credence to the British line that “we never joined up to political union, only a common market”, and the suggestion other states share that analysis, provoked several members of the audience to demur forcibly.For one thing the distinction between “economic” and “political” union is somewhat artificial, and, as Fabbrini admits, the British position is a “misunderstanding” – some would say a deliberate obfuscation – of the reality that the EEC was founded as an explicitly political project. Economic integration was the means to an end indeed, as one member of the audience pointed out, but for a parliamentary mix-up in France the EEC was almost founded as a defence union.Fabbrini is right to say that the new model of “future relationship” being negotiated between the EU and UK, a trading partnership with much access to the single market and EU programmes, could become a template for other “association” relationships with “third countries” – although there are already good templates in the arrangements that countries like Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine and Turkey have with the EU.But the idea that such a formalised framework of concentric circles could also accommodate some of the “difficult” member states as second-class members is far more problematic.In recent years the EU has embraced a new form of integration , “differentiated integration”, in which it tries to accommodate those who want to move forward more quickly and those reluctant to do so – but without creating a hierarchy of members, or unpicking the basic institutional structure of the EU, a bargain in which all member states preserve equality in ultimate decision-making.“Europe has developed in variable geometry,” Fabbrini points out in a recent paper. “Two countries (the UK and Denmark) have a derogation from adopting the common currency two countries (the UK and Ireland) have an opt-out from Schengen and three countries (the UK, Poland and the Czech Republic) have obtained a protocol that seeks to exempt them from the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.“Moreover, 25 member states have embarked in the process of enhanced co-operation to set up a unitary patent court, and 10 euro-zone countries are discussing the introduction of a financial transaction tax.”And he could have mentioned the 25 member states that signed up in December to the military co-operation project Pesco.But preserving the essential equality of members, even if they are proceeding at different speeds, is vital. It is precisely the most “difficult” member states, like Poland and Hungary, so loath to share in common tasks like easing partners’ refugee burden, that are most resistant to any institutionalisation of a multiple-speed EU.They fear being treated as second-class members, and see in it an opportunity for the wealthier states to step back from their willingness to help poorer states catch up through cohesion and structural funding. “Solidarity, brothers,” they say, “is the backbone of the EU.” Although it may sound strange from those quarters.The UK’s declaration of intent to depart was seen by some as likely to herald a rush for the exit door. Instead, as many observers have noted, it led if anything to a renewed spirit of togetherness and determination not to see the project undermined by an always-reluctant member.Hard cases make bad law, and it would be mistaken to see Brexit as a rationale for institutionalising a profound “misunderstanding”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/04/13/TELEMMGLPICT000085051753_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkUE_BTgBOQu3VWKvpDGX9b6IT27HgWfEymhU_wUI4Tk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"day 1742 glorious tones ofhandels messiah heard first time public","story":"Händel’s Messiah performed at the Royal Albert HallOn 13 April 1742, the Great Music Hall on Dublin’s Fishamble Street was packed for a charity concert.

Dames Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright have let the cameras in on a friendship that goes back more than half a century.In a new film being released next month, the four acting greats discuss their careers and reminisce about their humble beginnings in the theatre.For Dame Judi and Dame Maggie, that was a production at the Edinburgh Festival back in the 1950s.“Were we good?” asks Dame Maggie, who can’t recall it at all.“No, I don’t think we were,” replies Dame Judi, dissolving into fits of laughter.The film, Nothing Like A Dame, will be released on May 2. It will air on BBC Two in the summer.The foursome were filmed over a weekend at Dame Joan Plowright\u0026#39s country retreatIt was shot at the country retreat that Dame Joan shared with her husband, Sir Laurence Olivier, until his death in 1989.Dame Joan, who is now blind, brought the friends together for a weekend of conversation. It was filmed by Roger Michell, director of Notting Hill and Enduring Love.The film-makers describe it as “candid, funny, caustic, irreverent, poignant and utterly engrossing”.There is a great deal of laughter - Dame Judi’s habit of nabbing all the plum roles is a target for her friends’ jokes, as is Dame Maggie’s less than enthusiastic reaction to becoming internationally famous thanks to her role as the Dowager Countess in Downton Abbey.But there are also tears as the friends, all widowed, discuss love and loss.The film’s producer, Sally Angel, said: “They had a lot of courage, to work without a script. We didn’t know what we were going to get.“But they are funny and witty and sharp. They are in their eighties, very lively women, and it is a celebration of friendship.”:: Nothing Like A Dame is in cinemas on Wednesday May 2\u0026#39Tiny\u0026#39 firms on Irish border could have tax free status after Brexit, says David Davis Sir Cliff Richard demands BBC pay for his autobiography cancelled after coverage of police raidWe can\u0026#39t think rationally without emotions.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The allegations centre around online strategies for the manipulation of voters deployed in the US 2016 Presidential election and the UK’s European Union referendum. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has given evidence to parliament. Meanwhile, across the pond, Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify in front of the US Congress. The backlash has been brutal with the #DeleteFacebook movement taking off. Markets have responded accordingly with Facebook’s share value plummeting.Writing in The Observer last year, Carole Cadwalladr posited that Britain (and one may as well add the US) are increasingly looking like “a ‘managed’ democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.”However, the real story is much bigger than the fallout from the Trump election and the Brexit vote. It is a story that extends beyond a limited set of players in Silicon Valley and the billionaire super class. It encompasses governments, the military and intelligence agencies intent on exploiting the internet and social media for surveillance, control and manipulation of citizens and societies. Facebook removes hundreds of pages controlled by Russian organisationThe concept of managed democracy stretches back a hundred years. After the introduction of universal suffrage, the establishment was concerned about the outcome of elections. During the 1920s Edward Bernays was one of the pivotal figures who helped to develop the concept of managed democracy. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the father of modern-day public relations. He understood that advertising could subliminally tap into the unconscious of repressed animal instincts, such as sexual desire. Bernays’ clients included some of the largest US corporations. Bernays transplanted the same techniques into politics as outlined in Adam Curtis’s 2002 BBC documentary The Century of the Self. This could be achieved through propaganda in various guises, such as the use of mass media in order to manipulate populations. The US military and CIA deployed psychological operations (mass propaganda induced through emotions) across the world in various theatres ranging from the wars in Korea and Vietnam to Central America during the Cold War. The only difference today is that the internet has become the new playground for 21st century psychological operations. How Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlHow Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlDonald Trump, Mike Pence and technology company chiefs at a meeting at Trump Tower in New York, 2016Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to testify before the US Congress following pressure from politiciansThe 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease around technologyGoogle’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in IraqChristopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica and now a whistleblower who exposed how the data firm harvested data from millions of Facebook usersAccording to The Observer, billionaire Robert Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10 million stake in the company Cambridge Analytica.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, prior to the US 2016 election, online automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Whisteblower Edward Snowden\u0027s files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook.Silicon Valley – from heroes to villainsFor a long time, Silicon Valley presented itself as the shiny, happy face of capitalism. It sold the promise of new technology that could connect the global village. Facebook’s mission statement was, “Making the world more open and connected”. The internet even held out the utopian possibility of liberating societies. Networks amplified political activism and bypassed the monopoly of the corporate media. The internet provided a cloak of anonymity for whistleblowers fighting state andor corporate power. Wikileaks and Julian Assange would even attempt to take credit for catalysing the Arab Spring through the Cablegate leaks revealing the corruption and vulgar excesses of tinpot dictators. Yet as with all technology, it has proved to be a double-edged sword. Disturbing revelations have exposed a darker side of exploitative, highly secretive and even sinister practices. Public sentiment has turned from infatuation to outrage. The 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease.The marriage of big data and neoliberalism enabled the metrics of the market to be extended to every sphere in society. A Black Mirror episode “Nosee” imagined the dystopian vision in which this process is taken to its logical conclusion. Every emotional experience, lived moment and interaction is exploited, mined, recorded and measured with constant recalibration interfacing with one’s personal score and therefore social status. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is one of those credited with creating the profession of public relations (Getty)From here it is a short step to Foucault’s concept of the panopticon in which each person is scrutinising and scrutinised by everyone else. The mass collection and retention of data became linked in with surveillance – big brother meets big data. Simultaneously, big tech managed to carve out a libertarian philosophy while being integrated with the national security state. In fact, Silicon Valley has increasingly become part of the military-industrial complex selling its technologies to US military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Google, for example, has a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) allowing the agency to use Google Earth Builder. Google’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in Iraq, while Google and the NGA purchased GeoEye-1, which is the world’s highest-resolution satellite. Lacie, the protagonist in the ‘Black Mirror’ episode ‘Nosee’, rating her social interactions on her phone (Getty)In fact, Google has a revolving door with the national security state employing managers with backgrounds in military and intelligence work and it partners with defence contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman focusing on drones and robotics. Similarly, Amazon has developed a $600m (£426m) cloud computing system for the CIA that also services all 17 US intelligence agencies. Data-mining tech company Palantir was co-founded by Trump donor and backer Peter Thiel. Palantir’s advisers include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. Its customers include the NSA, FBI and CIA due to the fact that it is a leader in the field of mining massive data sets. It has been deployed by the Marines in Afghanistan and in the Mexican drug war. Its commercial clients include Bank of America, JPMorgan, News Corp and pharmaceutical firms. Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley tech billionaire, who also co-founded PayPal as a system of electronic payment. He went on to give Mark Zuckerberg the first outside investment in Facebook consisting of a half-million-dollar loan later converted into a 7 per cent ownership stake and a seat on the board. Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital Management had assets of more than $7bn before the financial crisis. His venture-capital firm Founders Fund has an online manifesto that begins, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” – summing up his pessimistic stance on the demise of technological utopianism.Thiel has cultivated a libertarian persona outlined in a 2009 essay titled The Education of a Libertarian. This fleshes out the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy since the 1920s. He argues that capitalism is “not popular with the crowd”. Thiel disparages the “unthinking demos”, which has made greater demands for social democratic concessions thus constraining capitalism. Thiel is apparently obsessed with economic stagnation diagnosing that, “without a new technology revolution, globalisation’s discontents would lead to increased conflict and, perhaps, a worldwide conflagration”. He is contemptuous of the failure of imagination of disconnected elites with the danger being that people will turn against capitalism. This is supported by a 2016 Harvard study, which found that a majority of American millennials reject capitalism with a third supporting socialism. It is also in keeping with the demographic shifts driving the Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn phenomena, in turn fuelled by intergenerational injustice. Is Trump right to say Amazon is costing the US Post Office billions?Trump’s biggest campaign donor was Robert Mercer – a reclusive American hedge-fund billionaire and computer scientist. Mercer began his career at IBM working on breakthroughs in language processing integral to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). He went on to become joint CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which applies algorithms to model and trade on financial markets. One of its funds – Medallion – is reportedly the most successful in the world. All of which has enabled Mercer to coordinate with the Koch brothers donating tens of millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns and ultra-conservative organisations. As The New Yorker investigative journalist Jane Mayer relates, both Mercer and oil tycoon William Lee Hanley had commissioned polling from Patrick Caddell ahead of the 2016 election, which showed “mounting anger towards wealthy elites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class.” The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”.Caddell and partners later went public with the Candidate Smith project based on the idea that the public wanted an outsider Mr. Smith Goes to Washington figure as president. Worryingly, the data also revealed that the public was yearning for a strong man to fix the country. Thiel (pictured with Donald Trump in 2016) is contemptuous of disconnected elites who he believes are turning people against capitalismAccording to The Observer, Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10m stake in the company Cambridge Analytica. It managed to build a 230-million-strong US voter database collecting up to 5,000 pieces of demographic, psychological, consumer and lifestyle information about each inidual with Facebook proving vital to this data profiling. The company is focused on the manipulation of psychographics – the study of personality traits – although its officials claim that this was not deployed in the 2016 US election. The power of the computer algorithms in question is such that 150 Facebook likes can be modelled to predict a person’s behaviour better than a family member. Three-hundred likes effectively means that the algorithm knows you better than a spouse. The effectiveness of this manipulation remains disputed although the power to micro-target iniduals and to induce mass effects at a population level points to sinister implications. Some authorities, such as Emma Briant (author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change), have stated that Cambridge Analytica has the technological capability to effect behavioural and psychological change.Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told a conference in New York his company was able to predict the personality of every adult in the US (Getty)Cambridge Analytica’s parent company is British corporation SCL Group – formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories. SCL Group works on psychological operations and foreign propaganda campaigns. It collects large amounts of data about an audience in order to identify “persuadables” and target them with tailored messages.  Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, declared at a 2016 conference in New York that, “by having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America”. SCL has worked in more than 60 countries including Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Pakistan. It “offers military clients techniques in ‘soft power’”, specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”. It has worked for Nato, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US State Department amongst others in “changing the behaviour of large groups”. In 2012, Facebook conducted studies involving secretive psychological testing of approximately 700,000 of its users. This was through reducing exposure to positive or negative emotional content in order to measure the effects. The study concluded: “Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks.” This study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while another Facebook project looked at how users consumed information on Twitter.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, one-third of all traffic on Twitter prior to the EU referendum was generated by automated “bots”, which were all pro-Leave and prior to the US 2016 election, the same automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Similarly, there were hundreds of automated websites pumping out pro-Trump messages crafting a mass consensus or political climate. Reportedly, there are thousands of dormant “sleeper” bots presumably waiting to be activated during a future crisis. The war on terror has enabled the state to amass authoritarian control over iniduals. The Washington Post’s 2010 Top Secret America investigation painted a terrifying vision of the US morphing into an Orwellian big brother state.Militarisation of homeland security is now extensive. General Atomics’ Predator drones monitor the Mexican and Canadian borders through real-time, full-motion video cameras. The Department of Homeland Security collects pictures, videos and other data on American citizens. It even helped Memphis police set up a crime-analysis fusion centre fitted with walls of streaming surveillance video capable of matching army command controls, while Maryland Police have infiltrated and labelled political activist groups dedicated to human rights, anti-war and bike lanes as terrorists.This conflation of the war on terror with political activism means that the definition of terrorism is widened to include any enemy of the state andor corporate interests. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange can thus be viewed as political prisoners or exiles. The US Department of Defence has been funding research into the use of the internet for 21st century psychological operations. The Pentagon’s military research arm – the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) – has been conducting experiments on the internet in order to study social connections, propagation of messages and influence behaviour. In fact, Darpa invented the precursor of the internet – Arpanet, Darpa’s social media in strategic communication (SMISC) programme is developing algorithms for the “formation, development and spread of ideas and concepts (memes)” on social media. SMISC is channelling millions in funding for projects to corporations and academic hubs. This has included studies analysing how Occupy activists used Twitter, Twitter users’ opinions on fracking and interactions of Twitter users in the Middle East. Recent revelations suggest that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users (Getty)The journalist Glenn Greenwald has revealed that both the NSA (National Security Agency) and its UK sister GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) have been working on exploiting social media. According to the Snowden files, this entails “propaganda”, “deception”, “mass messaging” and “pushing stories”. While GCHQ described its intentions to seed “state propaganda” across the internet. GCHQ’s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is focused on “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world” including “information ops (influence or disruption)”.US defence corporation General Dynamics is also involved in information operations. This includes contracts with the Special Operations Command’s psychological operations unit to design websites in order to persuade foreigners to align views with US interests.In-Q-Tel – the CIA’s venture capital firm – has been investing in companies engaged in social media mining and surveillance. Dataminr streams data from Twitter to spot trends for law enforcement agencies and hedge funds. Geofeedia collects social media messages in order to track activists for police departments and corporations. Pathar is used by the FBI to mine social media in order to determine networks and signs of radicalisation. Netbase is capable of scanning billions of sources online and Recorded Future monitors the worldwide web to predict future events. Bruce Lund wrote in a 2012 paper that “monitoring social media” is increasingly essential for government tracking of “erupting political movements, crises, epidemics, and disasters, not to mention general global trends”. Such strategies can be exploited for counterterrorism but are also being turned against citizens by law enforcement and against activist groups by the private sector. Palantir was thus exposed in negotiations to track trade union activists and other critics of the US Chamber of Commerce. Various police departments and corporations such as McDonald’s have contracted with Geofeedia, which markets its research into student demonstrations, Greenpeace and other political movements. In 2008, an Obama adviser, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote a controversial paper advocating the use of covert agents in order to cognitively infiltrate online groups, sites and activists. The Snowden files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook, attempt to “control, infiltrate, manipulate and warp online discourse” and remarkably even carry out “false flag operations” in order to discredit targets.In a wide-ranging New Yorker profile, Peter Thiel told author George Packer that the failures of the establishment have rekindled his optimism pointing the way either towards libertarianism or, conversely, Marxism, although he was forced to concede that unfettered capitalism is not acceptable to ordinary Americans.Peter has cultivated a libertarian persona – a 2009 essay fleshes out what he regard as the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy (Alamy)His thinking essentially represents the extreme manifestation of a growing consensus amongst elites that the status quo is unsustainable. This could lead potentially to instability, systemic collapse and civilizational crisis. In turn, this could pave the way either towards progressive, radical post-capitalist transformation that would necessarily damage vested interests – or conversely an authoritarian order designed to cement those interests. In fact, the status quo is liable to exacerbate inequality, poverty, climate change and social isions ensuring that authoritarian measures are necessary in the face of increasing rioting, disruption and social unrest. Indeed, economist and writer Joseph Stiglitz, who was previously chief economist at the World Bank, has piquantly asked how long it will be before the scenes witnessed during the Arab Spring will be replicated on the streets of America. As Thiel has put it: “The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of iniduals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” It appears that Thiel conceives of himself as this John Galt-type heroic figure lifted straight out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The battleground of politics has expanded to include the virtual world of the internet. This is in keeping with media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s prediction that World War Three would be a guerrilla information war with no distinction between military and civilian participation. Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.The everyday examples of flipping a coin or rolling a dice are useful analogies. While both appear to be random, these too could be predicted if enough information were available.Something like a coin flip may seem random, but its outcome could be predicted if one could see the exact path of the coin as it tumbles, said Dr Bierhorst. “Quantum randomness, on the other hand, is real randomness.” Quantum mechanics is better at generating randomness as measurements of quantum particles in a superposition have results that are fundamentally unpredictable.The scientists used photons – or light particles – from a laser to generate their random numbers in a process known as a “Bell test”.If you can solve one of these 6 major math problems, you\u0027ll win $1mThis method uses an intense laser fired at a special crystal that converts light into pairs of entangled photons – a quantum phenomenon. Measuring these photons provided the researchers with their numbers.The scientists trialled their Bell test over 55 million times, each time producing  two digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons.For the first time, Dr Bierhorst and his colleagues were able to close any “loopholes” that would allow seemingly non-random numbers to seem random. The results of this work were published in the journal Nature.“We\u0027re very sure we\u0027re seeing quantum randomness because only a quantum system could produce these statistical correlations between our measurement choices and outcomes,” said Dr Bierhorst.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities.“Labour wants to help young people make the most out of life by investing in them, which is why today we are pledging the next Labour government will provide the funds to cover free bus travel for under-25s, to support them to travel to work, to study and to visit friends.He will add: “Our policy provides help where it is most needed. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working age households without children.“Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel.

The party hopes the policy will encourage people to get into the habit of using cars only when necessary.Speaking alongside Mr Corbyn, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, will say: “Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long, private bus companies have run our services for profit not people.How UK rail fares have risen against the cost of living since 1995“The public purse already pays 42 per cent of the costs of providing local bus services, but deregulated private companies choose to run only the profitable services and leave councils to plug the gaps left for non-profitable but vital routes.“That’s why we’ll encourage local authorities to take back control of their buses so they can provide a better and more sustainable service to young and old alike, wherever they live.”The announcement follows a worrying fall in the number of people using buses, which is now at its lowest level in ten years.In London, the reduction has prompted fears among Transport for London (TfL) executives over the state of the organisation’s finances.This, coupled with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s decision to freeze some fares, means TfL is facing a deficit of almost £1bn next year.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Eight of the UK\u0027s 10 best-selling albums of 2017 were by homegrown talent, with Drake and Pink being the only outside entries. Sheeran\u0027s third album Divide was the most popular record across all formats last year and broke several industry records.Best albums of 2017Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards, said: The changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit with rapid revenue growth in 2017.We are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness among consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of subscriptions, such as the launch of YouTube\u0027s premium music service and the growing popularity of smart speakers in the home.\u0027How did we do all that?\u0027: Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart on EurythmicsFollowing predictions that streaming would overtake physical sales in the UK last year, Taylor said that while the British music sector was in rude health, the government should prioritise creative industries in a post-Brexit world. It means making sure that UK artists can tour freely in EU markets and that UK businesses can access the best talent. It means taking firm action against illegal websites that deny artists a living, and it means making clear in UK law that huge online platforms must pay fair royalties for the music they use.If we do this, the future for British music, which is already one of our leading exports, will be very bright, he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.

And they say that, if scaled up, the process could be used to build energy efficient homes quicker and cheaper than current techniques allow.A specially created machine named BatiPrint3D took just 18 days to complete the initial shell of the property using a polymer material. Concrete was then filled into hollow walls for insulation.The project - called Yhnova - also saw the Y-shaped home equipped with multiple sensors to monitor air quality, humidity and temperature, as well as systems to evaluate the thermal properties of the building.
