Evans\u0027 son, Bill Evans III was stationed in El Paso as a soldier. His son Bill Evans IV told DailyMail.com that he saw a close resemblance between Lillie and Doria Ragland, her great-niece          Unknown link: Until DailyMail.com told him that Doria Ragland was his step-grandmother\u0027s great-niece, Bill Evans IV had no idea that his family story included royalty. He and his wife got up at 4am to watch the wedding and spoke of their pride    Major competition: William Evans IV played exhibition games with Babe Ruth (right) and Lou Gehrig in New York in the late 1920s. The Yankees duo were pictured in 1929 in Cleveland, Ohio, holding the ball with which Ruth hit his 500th home run  Disgraced: The 1919 World Series ended the careers of Charles \u0027Swede\u0027 Risberg (left) and \u0027Shoeless\u0027 Joe Jackson (right) when their Chicago White Sox were accused of accepting a bribe to throw the series. They were to play against Williams Evans, however, as he recounted in 1975.           When Evans played for the Brooklyn Royal Giants in the late 1920s he would play against Major League stars including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in New York in exhibition games, finally being paid $2,000 a time when they played with babe Ruth. He kept the photograph as a memory but it is unclear where he is in the group          Author and historian Phil Dixon writes about Evans\u0027 talent in his book, American Baseball Chronicles: The Great Teams, the 1931 Grays. Dixon says that Evans, a Kentucky native, scored over 70 runs      Another pioneering story: William Evans and his wife Lillyn Brown were famous performers in the jazz age. Brown in particular was known for her cross-dressing act, performing as a man until the very end of the act when she would remove her top hat. She starred on Broadway and toured Europe and her death in 1969 was marked by a New York Times obituary          How she was: Lillyn Brown, Williams Evans\u0027s second wife, was one of early jazz\u0027s biggest stars. Her band, the JazzBo Synctopators, accompanied her and she appeared dressed both as a woman and as a man as she performed in Harlem, on Broadway and even toured Europe          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed on May 19 in Windsor. Bill Evans and his wife got up at 4am to watch the ceremony of a woman he now knows as a relatives\u0027My grandfather\u0027s nickname was Happy because he was a joyful person and wherever he traveled he made people happy. He was also called the Gray Ghost because he was quick.\u0027He played center field, short stop, right field, he was multi-talented. You see the longevity too, he had a long career - 21 years. He used to talk baseball all the time.\u0027We used to throw a little bit, he used to do all kinds of tricks with a baseball. Even at his older age, he\u0027d throw the ball, make it spin, throw it round his arm.\u0027 In his profile of Evans in his book on the Grays, author Dixon wrote: \u0027In 1931 the Philadelphia Tribune reported, that Evans\u0027 father was an actor of some repute during the 1920s and 1930s.\u0027Bill confirmed the claim and revealed his great grandfather was William Demont Evans, a 1920s black entertainer who worked in a double act with his wife Lillyn Brown, who would dress up as a man.The pair were big names on the \u0027Chitlin\u0027 Circuit\u0027 a group of US performance venues were it was safe and acceptable for African American entertainers to perform during segregation.The pair were themselves pioneers with their risque act: dressed in top hats and tails, they would execute a surprise ending.Her Majesty¿s new right hand woman!

Brown she had a lengthy and hugely successful career, claimed to be the first professional to sing the blues in concert, and appeared on Broadway repeatedly, her last being a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 1952, when she was 67.Brown was also noted for recording her own blues records, was a member of the Negro Actors\u0027 Guild of America and ran a performing arts school. She was William Evans\u0027 second wife and the two did not have children - William Jr was his son by his first wife. It is unclear if the Duchess of Sussex knows of her intriguing family history.Towards the end of Evans\u0027 career he met Lillie Ragland in Tennessee, where she was from. The couple then moved to California where there was more opportunity.Bill said: \u0027My grandfather was probably still playing ball or retiring when they met. Of course they witnessed all kinds of segregation and racism in Chattanooga and Louisville.\u0027Back in the 1950s a lot of the blacks from the east coast and down south moved to California for opportunities and sure enough they found the opportunity.  \u0027Lillie became the first black realtor director, man or woman, so she was a pioneer. After Bill retired from baseball he got into the aerospace industry, I think he was an inspector.\u0027Before that, however, Meghan\u0027s aunt worked for one of the all-time Hollywood greats, Bette Davis. In his book about the 1930-31 Homestead Grays, black baseball historian Phil Dixon wrote: \u0027After retiring from baseball Evans\u0027 relocated to Los Angeles, California, at which time his wife became a maid for actress Bette Davis.\u0027  Evans\u0027 grandson Bill Evans IV had not known he was related to Meghan until DailyMail.com revealed the link. But now he has given a fascinating insight into his grandfather\u0027s career as a star player in the Negro leagues when baseball was still segregated          Bill (left), 61, and his wife Cynthia (center) got up at 4am to watch the Royal wedding after finding out about his grandparents\u0027 link to Meghan while they were on vacation celebrating their own Silver anniversary.

Also in the picture are the Queen and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s older sister Jane. A friend of the Duchess said today that she believed the picture was taken  at the exclusive Guards Polo Club at Windsor. Her late father, Ronald Ferguson, had helped to start the club together with Prince Philip. It wasn’t the first time the pair had met as Sarah had moved in royal circles since she was baby. But the friend added: ‘Even at the age of ten Andrew and Sarah knew that they would marry!’          Scott was  extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty                                                    He arrived in London via Paris on a train reserved for German generals, smuggling important intelligence reports in 1941 and became the private secretary of King Peter of Yugoslavia, who was also living in exile in a suite at Claridge\u0027s.He spent several years working for King Peter before setting himself up as a photographer. Voynovich took his small Leica camera everywhere and often his hosts at weekend country house parties would invite him to take pictures.He was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, Princess Elizabeth\u0027s private secretary, so it was not long before she saw some of these pictures. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested Voynovich photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies.   This launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work.The auction takes place on June 14. Shocking moment jilted boyfriend shoots his former girlfriend deadC\u0027mon, Bambi!

In 2005, and after 40 years and quite a few fractures, the Prince of Wales announced his retirement from polo - the sport he once described as \u0027my one great extravagance\u0027. He played in matches from the age of 15 and as a child watched his father play          This unusually candid snap of the Queen kneeling on the grass with a reclining Lord Mountbatten (left) at a horse show reveals how remarkably unruffled she could be.

The success of this image launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. Wearing a flat cap and a tweed jacket, the keen horseman has often taken part in races and polo matches. Last year he opened up about the emotional moment he cradled his  racehorse Allibar when it collapsed and died during training in 1981          Prince Philip cooling off after a polo match.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the M*A*S*H stars - most of whom were still in costume. According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) meeting Bionic Man actor Lee Majors with his then-wife, Charlie\u0027s Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and movie royalty Sophia Loren  and Cary Grant at a star-studded Hollywood party in 1977          One of the photos shows the Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

If you are not from the area you will not know about the dangers but people just need to use their common sense.\u0027But the South Downs National Park Authority who maintain the Seven Sisters cliffs in Newhaven, East Sussex, have said that fences are impractical because of erosion.           One of the heart-stopping images Mr Spring took was of a young woman with her legs dangling off the edge of the cliff - while an older man took pictures. In another, four people stood inches from the edge and peered over the side to see the dramatic fall          A couple were pictured together with their legs dangling over the side, enjoying the romantic view when police arrived to spoil their party and, possibly, save them from harm. The cliffs, are in the same national park that saw a South Korean student plunge to her death after asking a fellow tourist to take a picture for her yards from the edge. She lost her footing and fell, an inquest heard at the time          Police were pictured telling off tourists after they have strayed too close the edge. Residents have called for proper signage or fencing to be put up to warn tourists of the danger.

A Tube strike will be taking place from 12:01am on Wednesday, June 6, 2018 and will last until 11:59pm. The Jubilee line is also scheduled to be suspended on Thursday, June 14 for a second 24-hour strike.Jubilee line strikeWhile the Jubilee line is the only Tube service that will be suspended for the entire day, the Bakerloo and Metropolitan lines in north-west London are also expected to be busy, because commuters will be using these lines as an alternative mode of transport.Some Metropolitan services that call at Baker Street will also call at Willesden Green, however. Stations such as Stratford, West Ham, South Hampstead, West Hampstead Thameslink and Hendon are expected to be busier than usual.The rest of the London Tube network is expected to operate as normal, with no other planned closures announced for the day. TfL will be running extra buses in order to cope with the additional passengers using this mode of transport.          With the Jubilee line being suspended, other lines are expected to be extremely busyWhy is there a strike?Jubilee line staff from both RMT and Aslef unions will stage a walkout on June 6 in a row over a new timetable, that has been imposed by TfL.This new timetable has been introduced so that peak service is extended on the busiest sections of the line by an hour, which will benefit thousands of passengers.However, the unions fear for how the new timetable will impact the work-life balance of the drivers, as it will ‘ride roughshod over current rostering agreements’, the RMT said. With the number of drivers working on Saturdays, a previous arrangement agreed upon in 2015, would be broken.Is the Tube strike really going to happen?Despite efforts to try and reach an agreement with the conciliation service Acas, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ‘RMT is bitterly disappointed that Tube managers have knocked back an opportunity to negotiate a settlement to this dispute in extensive talks that broke up on Friday. They failed to put a single proposal forward.          Despite efforts to reach an agreement, the strikes on both days in June 2018 will go ahead‘It is outrageous that Tube managers are trying to bulldoze through timetable changes without agreement that ride roughshod over existing rostering agreements.‘Drivers are angry at the impact on work-life balance and rightly see this move as the thin end of a very long wedge that could see processes and agreements unilaterally shredded by Tube bosses.TfL’s Director of Network Operations for London Underground, Nigel Holness added: ‘We have adhered to the strict agreements and policies we have with our trade unions. This action is completely unnecessary and I apologise to customers for the disruption that it will cause.‘I call on the unions to continue working with us for the benefit of our customers and our staff and to call off these strikes.’Transformers Bumblebee movie trailer, cast and plot revealedRed Dead Redemption 2 release date, trailer, editions and pre-orderState of Origin 2018: All you need to knowMagic Mike Live in London: All you need to knowE3 2018: All you need to know about the Electronic Entertainment ExpoTfL Tube strikes: All you need to know about the Jubilee line walkoutsWho is Chief Keef?

At the time he denounced the Huffington Post expose and called the internal emails \u0027unkind and untrue.\u0027¿You have to be sexy, you have to look sexy¿: Creepy moment...Bullying, catfights and fraudulent entries: Inside the...Share this article\u0027Much of what was reported is dishonest, deceptive, and despicable,\u0027 he said in a statement in December. \u0027The story is so unkind and untrue, and hurts me, my family, and the stewardship of this nonprofit. Those who know my heart know that this is not indicative of my character, nor is it indicative of my business acumen.\u0027Haskell resigned the following day and, just 10 days later, Carlson was named the new CEO.Carlson said it was a \u0027form or justice\u0027 that she was able to take over the role and saw the volunteer position as a \u0027call of duty\u0027.          When it first began in 1921, Miss America was actually a swimsuit competition called a \u0027bathing beauty revue\u0027 (pictured here are competitors during the swimsuit round in 1945)          Carlson said she hopes young women will realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. Pictured are competitors in 1947The selection of Carlson marked the first time a former pageant winner has served as the leader of the  organization. Now the entire leadership team for Miss America is made up of women.\u0027This is a new beginning, and change can sometimes be difficult, but I know a lot about change,\u0027 Carlson said.\u0027My life has worked in mysterious ways. I never thought I\u0027d be the chairwoman of the Miss America Organization, but here I am and we\u0027re moving it forward and we\u0027re evolving in this cultural revolution.\u0027 On Tuesday Carlson also touched on her recent work as an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual harassment.Her lawsuit against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who stepped down from his role after mounting pressure from additional employees with similar accusations, is seen as one of the first sparks of the #MeToo movement.\u0027I could have never expected what would happen when I sued my former employer at Fox News for sexual harassment 22 months ago, but look what happened,\u0027 she said. \u0027Thousands of women have been inspired to know that they can stand up and speak up and their voices will be heard.\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027ve been a beacon of hope to any woman in that process, it has been worth it.\u0027Miss America is scrapping its swimsuit competition | GMA"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CE453C200000578-0-image-a-93_1528207471745.jpg","title":"Fly tipping travellers clogged M1 underpass tons rubbish just half mile away","story":"    Travellers have arrived in a field in Sundon in Bedfordshire just one day after they were evicted from an underpass half-a-mile down the road          The group are believed to have contributed to a huge mess at Junction 12: This monster-fly tip turned an underpass into a rubbish-filled cave  but the travellers who were caught living there on Monday were allowed to move on          The travellers who were evicted broke onto the land in Luton Road, Sundon just hours later - and the number of caravans appeared to have dramatically increased           It is not just one set of travellers on the field.

Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/18/4CEB5D7500000578-5809255-image-a-30_1528221377067.jpg","title":"Distance swimmer Ben Lecomtes children wave embarks 5 500 mile Pacific crossing","story":"    Ben Lecomte, 51, on the start line with his family - wife Trinh (second right), daughter Ana (right) and son Max (second left)          Lecomte comforting his wife Trinh as he prepares to enter the water in his full-length wetsuit          Lecomte paddling in the waters of the Pacific with his son Max and daughter Ana (right)According to Lecomte, who celebrated his 51st birthday two days ago, he is undertaking the journey as part of a scientific research project aimed at raising awareness about plastic pollution. On his journey he will be crossing a patch of ocean known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an area three times the size of France where large amounts of garbage and plastic waste have collected. \u0027Pollution of the ocean has a big impact,\u0027 said the father-of-two, who will be gathering oceanographic and medical data for 27 scientific organisations, including NASA.French man to SWIM 5,500 miles solo across the Pacific from...British ex-policeman Ben Hooper begins his 2,000-mile swim...\u0027I needed a change, so I thought why not?\u0027 Father-of-one to...Share this article\u0027When I was little and I was with my father walking on the beach, I didn\u0027t see any plastic, or hardly any.\u0027Now every time I go with my kids, we see plastic everywhere,\u0027 added Lecomte, who will also wear a device to test levels of radioactive material from the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant.\u0027It made me think what (the) future for my kids is going to be like.

The full list can be found at the bottom of the page.          Detroit, Michigan is the number one worst place to live in America 1. Detroit, MichiganPopulation: 672,829Median home value: $43,500Poverty rate: 35.7 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 14.9 percentWith its shrinking population and highly impoverished citizens, Detroit, Michigan  was ranked worst city in the country to live in. At its peak in the 1950s, the city was home to 1.8 million residents, but now that has dwindled to fewer than 700,000. With one in every three Detroit residents living below the poverty line, low incomes and a nearly 11 percent unemployment rate factored highly in this city\u0027s placement on the list. The city is also famously dangerous, with more than 2,000 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2016.     Flint, Michigan is the second-worst place to live in America, according to a new study2. Flint, MichiganPopulation: 97,379Median home value: $28,200Poverty rate: 44.5 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 10.5 percentFlint is ranked second worst city to live in in the U.S., based largely on the profound poverty of the area. Nearly 45 percent of the population lives below the poverty line - the highest rate of any city in the country. Flint also has an unemployment rate of roughly 10 percent. High crime rates make it a difficult place to run a business, and only 10.5 percent of city residents have a bachelor\u0027s degree, making for an under-educated job force. Rounding out the grim picture is the violent crime rate of 1,587 incidents per 100,000 residents in 2016.           St. Louis, Missouri ranks third on the list of worst places to live in America 3. St. Louis, MissouriPopulation: 311,404Median home value: $125,800Poverty rate: 23.8 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 34.1 percentSt. Louis came in third nationwide for worst places to live, with violent crime being a major factor in the city\u0027s ranking. The city had 1,932 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2016, the third-highest of any city in the country - and five times the national crime rate. The city is also very poor, with nearly 24 percent of residents living below the poverty line. St. Louis is also seeing a major decline in its population, with a decrease of 11.2 percent over the past decade.             Las Vegas comes in fourth place on the list of worst places to live in America4. Las Vegas, NevadaPopulation: 632,916Median home value: $228,300Poverty rate: 15.6 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 23.0 percentWith 2,136 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents, Las Vegas is the most dangerous city in the U.S. - a major indicator that placed the city in fourth on the list of worst places to live in America.Another major factor for Sin City\u0027s ranking was property crimes - including larceny, burglary and motor vehicle theft. The city had 7,268 property crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2016.If Las Vegas had lower crime rates, other factors would likely elevate the city off of the list of worst places to live.            A new study ranks Memphis the fifth-worst place to live in America 5. Memphis, TennesseePopulation: 652,752Median home value: $96,800Poverty rate: 26.9 percent Population with at least a bachelor’s degree: 25.6 percentQuality of life in Memphis is dramatically impacted by high poverty levels and crime rates, all elements that placed this city fifth on the list of worst cities in America.Nearly 27 percent of residents are living below the poverty line - more than in any other city in the state. Memphis also has a crime problem, with 1,830 violent crimes in the city for every 100,000 residents in 2016 - nearly five times the U.S. violent crime rate.             Wilmington, Delaware ranks seventh on the list of worst places to live in America 7. Wilmington, DelawarePopulation: 71,455Median home value: $145,600Poverty rate: 27.7 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 25.6 percentDelaware\u0027s low income levels, coupled with a high cost of living contributed to the city place seventh on the list of America\u0027s worst cities to live in.  The average household earns just $36,435 a year — significantly below the median income of $57,617 nationwide. In addition, nearly 28 percent of the city lives below the poverty line, nearly double the national rate. Despite that, the cost of living in Wilmington is about 17 percent more expensive than the the national average.Crime is a factor, too: Wilmington had 1,798 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2016.           Albany, Georgia ranks eighth on the list of worst places to live in America 8. Albany, GeorgiaPopulation: 74,904Median home value: $88,800Poverty rate: 32.5 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 20.1 percentAlbany, Georgia is losing residents faster than most other cities on this list - its population declined nearly 5 percent over the past five years.The hoards of people moving away is likely due, in part, to the limited economic opportunities in the region. Nearly a third (32.5 percent) live in poverty, and 7 percent of workers are unemployed - one of the highest rates of any city in Georgia.            Springfield, Missouri ranks 9th place on the list of worst places to live in America9. Springfield, MissouriPopulation: 167,313Median home value: $115,900Poverty rate: 24.6 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 25.7 percentSpringfield is a dangerous city, with violent crime a key factor placing it in ninth place on the list of worst places to live. The city had 1,345 violent crimes for every 100,000 city residents in 2016, more than triple the nationwide rate.  Springfield residents are also plagued by property crimes, with 8,518  for every 100,000 people in 2016, the third highest property crime rate in the country.Solidifying Springfield\u0027s place on the list is the fact that one in every four residents live below the poverty line - more than any other city in the state of Missouri.            Baltimore ranks 10th place on the list of worst places to live in America 10. Baltimore, MarylandPopulation: 614,664Median home value: $153,500Poverty rate: 21.9 percentPopulation with at least a bachelor’s degree: 30.8 percentPoverty coupled with cost of living helped land Baltimore on the list of worst places to live in America. The city has a median household income of $47,350, and Baltimore residents pay 12 percent more for goods and services than the nationwide average.Baltimore is also home to some of the most congested roadways in the country, contributing to a diminished quality of life. The average commute is more than 30 minutes, longer than in most other parts of the country.  50 Worst Cities to Live In - 247 Wall St."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/22/4CF3CEC600000578-5809955-image-a-5_1528235277869.jpg","title":"Al Roker takes Twitter moan bike thief later apologizes","story":"    Al Roker attends the Time 100 Gala at Frederick P.

You will have customs tariffs. It will make things difficult.’Mr Stadler’s comments came as European ports told MPs they could have efficient new customs systems up and running in time for the UK’s exit from the EU – provided ministers get on with making a decision on which model they want.Joachim Coens, chief executive officer of the port of Zeebrugge, said it was vital that an agreement on future customs arrangements was in place by the time the proposed transition period kicks in next March. He said: ‘The transition period of two years if fine, provided we know from the beginning of that transition period what we have to do.’Mr Coens also played down suggestions that a new customs system would result in catastrophic extra costs for business, saying: ‘I believe the costs are not the big issue.’Benoit Rochet, deputy chief executive officers at the port of Calais, also said he wanted more detail from the British Government on its preferred option. Asked repeatedly whether Calais would be ready in time, he replied: ‘We’ll have to be. Time is running, but we will not have a choice, we will have to be.’John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which runs the Channel Tunnel, said they were still waiting for clarity from the Government. ‘In order to make our contingency planning, we need to have a direction to go in,’ he added.Meanwhile, HMRC chief Jon Thompson faced criticism from MPs over his claim last month that the Government’s new customs plans could cost business £20 billion a year.Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said most industry experts, including one study used by HMRC, predicted additional costs would add just 1 per cent – a fifth of the amount claimed by HMRC. ‘You do seem quite out of line with everyone else,’ he told Mr Thompson.Mr Thompson acknowledged the figure was ‘speculative’, but insisted it was his department’s best estimate."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/01/4CF49BF200000578-0-image-a-18_1528244801719.jpg","title":"Number people living poverty line UK maybe half thought official figures show","story":"    ONS report said 22.8 per cent of the population is considered poor on the basis of declared income but when spending taken into account, that figure is halved (file picture) Its findings put a major question mark over claims of the poverty lobby that many millions are going hungry and undermines routine demands from charity chiefs, Left-wing politicians and churchmen for ever-larger state benefits to alleviate hardship.The report said that while 22.8 per cent of the population is considered poor on the basis of declared income, the share of the population who are poor when their spending is taken into account is 11.5 per cent.‘The degree of overlap between these groups may provide valuable information in supporting the effective development and targeting of policies,’ the ONS report said.The commonly used poverty line marks anyone as poor if they are living on less than 60 per cent of average income.

The commonly used poverty line marks anyone as poor if they are living on less than 60 per cent of average incomeONS researchers said some people may not be disclosing their full income when surveys are conducted. ‘Certain types of benefits tend to be under-reported,’ they added.It was also noted that ‘people towards the bottom of the income distribution often have multiple income sources, which makes measurement error harder to avoid’.The figures, which did not include housing costs, were based on the Family Resources Survey, which asks people in 19,000 homes about their income each year, and the Living Costs and Food Survey, which records the annual spending of 6,000 homes.Yesterday academic and researcher into the family Patricia Morgan said: ‘A large number of people are working unofficially and are unlikely to declare their incomes. There are many single mothers who are in fact supported by partners, but will be reluctant to discuss it because they wish to keep their benefits.‘All this is ignored by the poverty lobby. Spreading the idea there are very high levels of poverty is their business.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/02/00/4CD3CF9300000578-0-image-m-20_1527896362330.jpg","title":"Nikes new slides pocket store coins keys youre beach","story":"    Its £37 ‘bumbag sandal’ has a small zip bag fastened to the straps, with enough room for car keys or small changeGeorgia teen with no prior run-ins with the law is given a...That will teach them!

A friend of the Duchess said today that she believed the picture was taken  at the exclusive Guards Polo Club at Windsor. Her late father, Ronald Ferguson, had helped to start the club together with Prince Philip. It wasn’t the first time the pair had met as Sarah had moved in royal circles since she was baby. But the friend added: ‘Even at the age of ten Andrew and Sarah knew that they would marry!’          Scott was  extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty                                                    He arrived in London via Paris on a train reserved for German generals, smuggling important intelligence reports in 1941 and became the private secretary of King Peter of Yugoslavia, who was also living in exile in a suite at Claridge\u0027s.He spent several years working for King Peter before setting himself up as a photographer. Voynovich took his small Leica camera everywhere and often his hosts at weekend country house parties would invite him to take pictures.He was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, Princess Elizabeth\u0027s private secretary, so it was not long before she saw some of these pictures. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested Voynovich photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies.   This launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work.The auction takes place on June 14. Shocking moment jilted boyfriend shoots his former girlfriend deadC\u0027mon, Bambi!

In 2005, and after 40 years and quite a few fractures, the Prince of Wales announced his retirement from polo - the sport he once described as \u0027my one great extravagance\u0027. He played in matches from the age of 15 and as a child watched his father play          This unusually candid snap of the Queen kneeling on the grass with a reclining Lord Mountbatten (left) at a horse show reveals how remarkably unruffled she could be.

The success of this image launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. Wearing a flat cap and a tweed jacket, the keen horseman has often taken part in races and polo matches. Last year he opened up about the emotional moment he cradled his  racehorse Allibar when it collapsed and died during training in 1981          Prince Philip cooling off after a polo match.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the M*A*S*H stars - most of whom were still in costume. According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) meeting Bionic Man actor Lee Majors with his then-wife, Charlie\u0027s Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and movie royalty Sophia Loren  and Cary Grant at a star-studded Hollywood party in 1977          One of the photos shows the Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

I am sure it will matter to many young women in the future.\u0027   Others took aim at the many men who expressed disappointed at the news.           Carlson said she is not concerned that the changes will hurt the competition\u0027s viewership          \u0027Interestingly enough that’s not a highly rated part of the competition,\u0027 she said of the swimsuit round. \u0027People actually like the talent part of the competition\u0027\u0027The guys most upset about #MissAmerica dropping the swimsuit competition look exactly how you would expect them to,\u0027 quipped fashion bloggers Tom \u0026amp Lorenzo.  \u0027Someone actually just said that Miss America will no longer be a celebration of women without the swimsuit competition. Yes because the only way women can be celebrated is in a bikini,\u0027 another sarcastically joked.  Meanwhile, Carlson said she is not concerned that the changes will hurt the competition\u0027s viewership. \u0027Interestingly enough that\u0027s not a highly rated part of the competition,\u0027 she said of the swimsuit round. \u0027People actually like the talent part of the competition.\u0027 Carlson added that she hopes young women realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. \u0027I want to inspire thousands of young people across this country to come and be a part of our program,\u0027 she said.            Carlson (pictured before winning Miss America in 1989) is the first former pageant winner to serve as the leader of the organization  Carlson was specifically targeted in the leaked emails among Haskell and others, in which he wrote of tactics he hoped would drive her insane           Leaked internal emails made public in a HuffPost report showed Haskell (pictured, September 2017) and others demeaning the appearance and intellect of former pageant winners\u0027We want you and we want to celebrate your accomplishments and your talents and then we want to hand you scholarships.\u0027 Miss America made headlines last year after leaked emails showed Haskell and other male board members referring to former contestants as \u0027c***s\u0027. In one email, Haskell wrote of tactics he hoped would drive Carlson insane.  Haskell was initially suspended from his role.

Those who know my heart know that this is not indicative of my character, nor is it indicative of my business acumen.\u0027Haskell resigned the following day and, just 10 days later, Carlson was named the new CEO.Carlson said it was a \u0027form or justice\u0027 that she was able to take over the role and saw the volunteer position as a \u0027call of duty\u0027.          When it first began in 1921, Miss America was actually a swimsuit competition called a \u0027bathing beauty revue\u0027 (pictured here are competitors during the swimsuit round in 1945)          Carlson said she hopes young women will realize that Miss America is \u0027now open, inclusive, and transparent\u0027. Pictured are competitors in 1947The selection of Carlson marked the first time a former pageant winner has served as the leader of the  organization. Now the entire leadership team for Miss America is made up of women.\u0027This is a new beginning, and change can sometimes be difficult, but I know a lot about change,\u0027 Carlson said.\u0027My life has worked in mysterious ways. I never thought I\u0027d be the chairwoman of the Miss America Organization, but here I am and we\u0027re moving it forward and we\u0027re evolving in this cultural revolution.\u0027 On Tuesday Carlson also touched on her recent work as an outspoken advocate for victims of sexual harassment.Her lawsuit against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who stepped down from his role after mounting pressure from additional employees with similar accusations, is seen as one of the first sparks of the #MeToo movement.\u0027I could have never expected what would happen when I sued my former employer at Fox News for sexual harassment 22 months ago, but look what happened,\u0027 she said. \u0027Thousands of women have been inspired to know that they can stand up and speak up and their voices will be heard.\u0027 \u0027If I\u0027ve been a beacon of hope to any woman in that process, it has been worth it.\u0027Miss America is scrapping its swimsuit competition | GMA"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/15/4CE453C200000578-0-image-a-93_1528207471745.jpg","title":"Fly tipping travellers clogged M1 underpass tons rubbish just half mile away","story":"    Travellers have arrived in a field in Sundon in Bedfordshire just one day after they were evicted from an underpass half-a-mile down the road          The group are believed to have contributed to a huge mess at Junction 12: This monster-fly tip turned an underpass into a rubbish-filled cave  but the travellers who were caught living there on Monday were allowed to move on          The travellers who were evicted broke onto the land in Luton Road, Sundon just hours later - and the number of caravans appeared to have dramatically increased           It is not just one set of travellers on the field.

We love to sell cars to Great Britain.’Mr Stadler said there would be no winners if a trade deal wasn’t struck between the EU and the UK, and that it would ‘cost jobs’ in both Germany and Britain. The issue of tariffs was on everyone’s minds, but was still ‘hypothetical’, he said, adding that he hoped a deal would be done, but it was down to the respective governments.Mr Stadler’s intervention will pile pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to push Brussels to stop stalling on a trade deal with Britain.

You will have customs tariffs. It will make things difficult.’Mr Stadler’s comments came as European ports told MPs they could have efficient new customs systems up and running in time for the UK’s exit from the EU – provided ministers get on with making a decision on which model they want.Joachim Coens, chief executive officer of the port of Zeebrugge, said it was vital that an agreement on future customs arrangements was in place by the time the proposed transition period kicks in next March. He said: ‘The transition period of two years if fine, provided we know from the beginning of that transition period what we have to do.’Mr Coens also played down suggestions that a new customs system would result in catastrophic extra costs for business, saying: ‘I believe the costs are not the big issue.’Benoit Rochet, deputy chief executive officers at the port of Calais, also said he wanted more detail from the British Government on its preferred option. Asked repeatedly whether Calais would be ready in time, he replied: ‘We’ll have to be. Time is running, but we will not have a choice, we will have to be.’John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which runs the Channel Tunnel, said they were still waiting for clarity from the Government. ‘In order to make our contingency planning, we need to have a direction to go in,’ he added.Meanwhile, HMRC chief Jon Thompson faced criticism from MPs over his claim last month that the Government’s new customs plans could cost business £20 billion a year.Dover MP Charlie Elphicke said most industry experts, including one study used by HMRC, predicted additional costs would add just 1 per cent – a fifth of the amount claimed by HMRC. ‘You do seem quite out of line with everyone else,’ he told Mr Thompson.Mr Thompson acknowledged the figure was ‘speculative’, but insisted it was his department’s best estimate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd72de49c25689edaf925eefc10536009f342747/0_230_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801a69e63a10689f2a8154ace455d858","title":"its been my whole life alan and his photobooths a picture essay","story":"The famous photobooth at Flinders Street station in Melbourne has been the centre of one family’s life.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland.

People will be able to make their homes suit them, personalise them, and make them more aesthetically pleasing.” Van Gurp said he believed that the use of 3D printers in the construction of homes would be “mainstream” within five years.The five homes – being constructed consecutively in a wood in the district of Meerhoven close to Eindhoven’s airport – will be completed by the middle of 2019. They will be rented out by the real estate company Vesteda. “We have to get the permits and the houses will be built in line with all Dutch housing regulations,” said Van Gurp. “We can make all the calculations but we actually have to do tests which involves making the walls in real life.”Asked whether he would live in one of the homes, Van Gurp said: “For the first house we already have 20 candidates, and that is after only a week of having the images on our website. I have three children, and so the first one would be too small for us. But I would live in the biggest house, yes.”All the houses will have foundations built using the conventional methods. “We only use 3D printing where there is value to it,” Van Gurp said.Eindhoven University of Technology has been a pioneer in 3D printing using concrete. Last year the south-eastern town of Gemert opened the world’s first 3D-printed cycle bridge, which had been made at the university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/948084d12f34edaf4929b0d381e8cf92d5303fc3/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daadbdfff8bd91c83a43f7ba8b4dd289","title":"british sculptors in pictures anne katrin purkiss photographs","story":"Cornelia Parker, Elisabeth Frink, Damien Hirst and Grayson Perry are among the artists Anne-Katrin Purkiss captures in striking portraits"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11694b8ffcf4e919842b0eeac040bdbef986045e/0_50_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=618f246b3683de15f53e486854c425e7","title":"tsb chief receives stinging rebuke from city watchdog","story":"Bank failed to be ‘open and transparent’ over IT meltdown affecting 1.9m customers, says FCAThe City regulator has launched a stinging attack on the chief executive of TSB over the bank’s failure to be open and transparent with customers when an IT upgrade went badly wrong, locking as many as 1.9 million customers out of their accounts.The Financial Conduct Authority accused Paul Pester of “portraying an optimistic view” of services after the botched operation in April that is still causing disruption for customers more than a month on.“The FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB’s communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced,” Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said in a letter to the Commons Treasury committee.The City regulator’s damning assessment increased the pressure on Pester as he prepared to make a second appearance in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday.In a critical assessment of Pester’s personal handling of the IT meltdown, Bailey also suggested that the TSB boss might have been more forthcoming with MPs on the Treasury Committee when he gave evidence on 2 May. Bailey said at the time of the hearing Pester may have had information from tech experts at IBM who had been drafted in to help cope with the meltdown. “We are … concerned that at the time of the committee hearing, the CEO may have been in possession of an initial set of slides by IBM which provided initial views on the incident, and could therefore have shared more detail on this with the committee.”The FCA has the power to fine TSB over the incident and said it was investigating the crisis jointly with the Prudential Regulation Authority. The system failure happened when TSB transferred customer records to a new IT platform. Noting the extraordinary nature of the situation, Bailey said: “We do not normally make this information public, but given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.” He said Pester and the TSB board were accountable for the decision to press ahead with the systems upgrade.Responding to Bailey’s comments, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury committee, said she was deeply concerned by TSB’s failings.“The regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB’s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced by its response to customer fraud and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the committee.“The committee will discuss Mr Bailey’s letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.”“In the meantime, we continue to focus on doing whatever it takes to put things right for our customers, and ensuring that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the recent IT issues.” During his first encounter with MPs, Pester was accused by Morgan of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he said the bank’s move to the new IT system had mostly run smoothly.Up to 1.9 million online and mobile banking customers at TSB began experiencing problems with their accounts on Monday 23 April after the bank – now owned by Spanish lender Sabadell – migrated from an IT system inherited from the previous owner, Lloyds Banking Group.Bailey also said that the risk and scale of customer fraud had increased since the migration, and that TSB had failed to meet regulatory requirements of refunding all affected customers “as soon as practicable and in any event by the end of the business day after the day which it became aware of the fraud”.The FCA said “operational challenges” still persisted in some TSB bank branches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce93dc284baa28c6e249cf9af32df33fadf3aec9/0_244_5050_3029/master/5050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb5f6e6eee45ebfddbe8fe072c00e18e","title":"primary school girls boys sports day","story":"It’s astonishing what people can work themselves up into a lather about these days. A primary school in Inverness has announced that girls and boys will compete together on sports days. Incredibly, the news has prompted national debate.As Dr Hilary Jones said, introducing the debate on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, girls and boys are physically on an even level at primary age so there is no scientific reason to separate them.For the local councillor who noted that the Olympics didn’t do mixed-gender competitions – actually they do. Tokyo 2020 will include mixed-gender relays in swimming, athletics and triathlon, as well as mixed team events in archery, fencing and judo. There will also be a mixed doubles table tennis competition.In sports such as equestrianism and horse racing, men and women have long been competing directly against each other. And at long last women are increasingly growing in profile and success in these disciplines, whether that’s Katie Walsh, Bryony Frost and Rachael Blackmore competing in the Grand National this year, or motor racing star Alice Powell, who has spent her career challenging for podium places alongside the men.In football, girls and boys are allowed to play together up until the age of 18 after the Football Association changed the rules in 2015, and girls’ teams can play against boys’ teams in organised leagues up to the age of 12.Back in Inverness one parent reportedly said that their son had been bullied as a result of being beaten by a girl. I’m sorry to hear of anyone being bullied, but isn’t the crux of the problem here archaic ideas about girls being less physically able than boys? In 2018 we should be teaching girls and boys to respect each other, not supporting regressive gender stereotypes. Why not bring in some brilliant female sporting role models to show the children just how amazing women are at sport? They could watch Team GB’s women’s football team beating Brazil in a thrilling match at the 2012 Olympic Games in front of a record crowd of 70,584. Or the England women’s cricket team winning the World Cup, watched by 120 million viewers on television.Crucially we are a nation of inactive adults and increasingly inactive children, the consequences of which will play havoc with our physical and mental health. School sports day should be about fun. We want children to learn that moving their bodies, gaining physical literacy and competing is enjoyable. For too many kids that message is still not getting through, creating negative associations about sport and exercise that last a lifetime.I do agree that there are spaces where gender segregation can be a positive thing. My pledge for Women in Football’s #WhatIf campaign is to help set up a girls’ football club because so few girls at my daughter’s school have had the opportunity to play our national game, while their male peers have been developing their skills on the ball for years. In this instance, it’s about evening up a historical inequality – a culture in which girls are less likely to play football than boys.Certainly as physical changes start to impact on boys and girls it makes sense to segregate sport by gender. But for four-year-olds doing the egg-and-spoon race? Come off it. That’s when we truly know the world’s gone mad.• Anna Kessel is a  sports writer, chair of Women in Football and author of Eat Sweat Play"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78f81e58c60ff76c9ae330aa125255525a324cb/0_0_2268_1360/master/2268.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a51ad8e9f58760d0bf409c27373c24f","title":"simon cowell giving up his phone is the ultimate show of affluence","story":"Smartphones used to be a status symbol. Now they are a necessity for all but the most privileged peopleDigital detoxes are all the rage these days, but did you know that unplugging from your smartphone suddenly can have severe, occasionally nauseating, side-effects? Within minutes of deciding to disconnect from the modern world to live a purer, more analogue life, some people have reported overwhelming feelings of smug superiority. Many of them appear to transform into modern messiahs, eager to preach the virtues of a smartphone-free life to anyone who will listen.All of that is great for Cowell. But far from being an astonishing confession, I would call his statements astonishingly condescending. Most people don’t have the luxury of abstaining from their smartphones. Many people rely on them to be able to take part in the gig economy. Ever heard an Uber driver talk about giving up their phone? Or a Deliveroo rider? No, because without their phones they would not be able to do their jobs.Just a few years ago, smartphones were a status symbol today they are the status quo. In our always-on world, it is choosing not to use your phone that is the ultimate show of affluence you could call this sans phone lifestyle luxury luddism. After all, the easiest way to make a living in the modern economy without a smartphone is to pay an army of assistants with phones to do things for you. I am sure Cowell did not arrange his interview with the Mail on Sunday by carrier pigeon.As smartphones have become ingrained in our lives, tech executives have claimed more concern about the ways in which they have hooked people to their wares. On Monday, Apple unveiled tools to help combat tech addiction at its Worldwide Developers Conference. These include Screen Time, which will let iOS users set daily time limits for apps. But while apps like these may be well meaning, they do little to solve the bigger issue – that, to opt out of the on-demand economy the tech titans helped create, you need to be immensely privileged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b04285cc5b4e918a320abbf07ccdf75e90dc387/0_235_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19406ad16acf507945b0131b2382a50","title":"rural town austerity buses witney","story":"The devastation of bus services is a silent legacy of recent Tory governments. But in Witney – David Cameron’s back yard – a not-for-profit service run by locals is providing a lifelineSit on the 210 for just a few minutes and strangers start to tell you things. They tell you crap jokes. They tell you how they were once ace footballers. About their heart problems. If you’re busy, they fill each other in on their just-completed trips to the GP or Aldi. And they’ll talk about how lost they’d be without this squat little bus turned impromptu social club.“If this weren’t running, I’d be knackered.”“I’d be a prisoner in my own home.”Before getting off, almost every passenger turns around and tells the driver how grateful they are.“See you Tuesday afternoon, Dave. I’ll bring the jokes.”For a mere 15-seater, the 210 holds a lot of different meanings. For its operators, it’s “an ice-cream van”, running from Witney to Chipping Norton through five villages in west Oxfordshire that are otherwise starved of public transport. For passengers it’s a lifeline, either saving them from spending their pension on a minicab or – for the young – begging parents for a lift. It’s a new service run by and for a community that has been stripped of scores of bus routes. And that makes it a journey into a huge yet silent crisis: the shredding of our bus services.Buses hardly get a mention in austerity Britain, yet they’re among its biggest casualties. Since 2010 funding for buses across England and Wales has been slashed by a third, while 134m miles of bus coverage has been lost over the past decade. Behind these big numbers are countless small stories of everyday indignity: of your nan no longer being able to get to the shops, or your teenage son struggling to clock on for a first job of lives stripped of independence, or days out breaking tiny budgets.Barely any of this is reflected in the London papers or what comes out of Westminster. They care more about trains. You can see why – our privatised services are big, costly and riddled with legalised larceny. But even so, buses figure far more in our everyday travel. Then again, expensive train commutes are for the all-important middle class, while buses ferry about the poor. “Bus cuts most hurt the lowest-paid, women and young, and old people who can’t just drive themselves about,” says Nicole Badstuber, a transport researcher at University College London (UCL). Even as he lopped tens of billions off public spending, the then chancellor, George Osborne, claimed repeatedly: “We’re all in it together.”To see what a lie that was, look at the land of the 210 bus. Oxfordshire is where David Cameron writes his memoirs in his £25,000 shed before hosting a kitchen supper. It’s where some of Downton Abbey was filmed, and Oxford colleges sit on billions in assets accumulated over centuries. It’s also where the county council is so broke that it’s flirting with denying disabled children free transport to school. On 20 July 2016, Oxfordshire county council scrapped all subsidies for bus services. The devastation was instant: that same day, 54 routes stopped altogether, while many more were reduced.“Now you’ve got dozens of villages in Oxfordshire with nothing. Nothing at all,” David Miles told me in Witney market square one morning last week. For years the parish representative on public transport, he can reel off routes, timetables and history. “Without a bus service, a village dies. Some people can’t even stay in their own homes. They have to go into care homes.”The local Labour councillor Laura Price chipped in: “Once transport goes, it’s harder for a village to keep its post office, its GP. They end up being these Cotswold beauty spots where people just keep a holiday home, rather than where anyone actually lives.” Miles: “And in Witney we just weren’t willing to accept that.”Those about to be abandoned lived on Witney’s outlying housing estates, usually pensioners who remember its days as a factory town. Perhaps they or their husband had a job with Smiths Industries and got a home on the Smiths estate. Now they are retired, possibly widowed, and depend on the bus taking them into the town centre and back home. Those buses were to be taken off the road with, as the council’s own documents admit, “no alternative services to the estates served by these routes”.Witney’s retirees were hit in 2016 by a national process that began 30 years earlier. In 1986 Margaret Thatcher privatised and deregulated buses everywhere outside London. From then on, any operator could run a route through Witney or anywhere else. Since they naturally wanted the most profitable commuter routes, it was left to local authorities to subsidise services with low margins but acute social need – such as getting sixty and seventysomethings out of the house.By letting private operators scoop all the profit and lumbering the public sector with the cost, Thatcher created a system that was always going to fall apart. It was just a matter of when – and the breaking point came in 2010 when her spiritual son Cameron began to inflict year upon year of spending cuts on local government.Months before the service shut, Labour’s Price hoped to whip up some opposition. The reaction surprised even her. Public meetings were packed out, with passengers, shopkeepers and young people fretting about their grans. “I’ll always remember one lady – she was almost in tears every time she spoke.”This made her wonder: why not take over the service? Sure, it was a bit of a left turn for her – the 38-year-old’s CV could be summed up as: worked in publishing, DJs northern soul records, raises a nine-year-old boy. No sign here of buses as a Mastermind subject. But “when your residents are crying because they’re going to be trapped in their homes, it’s not enough to say, ‘Aren’t the Tories evil?’ This felt like that one opportunity to do something practical while in opposition.”Others soon got onboard, such as bus expert Miles, who now helps with timetabling and routes for free. Frantic tin-rattling raised the 18 grand that bought an old bus, and at the start of 2017 West Oxfordshire Community Transport (WOCT) was on the road. From the start Price wanted the venture to be a co-operative: “We need people to understand they’ve got a stake in making it work.” Anyone paying a quid can be a voting member, drivers get a proper living wage, and whatever profits might turn up are reinvested in the business.The result is a mini-miracle, made of love and sweat. Price and a handful of others give their time for free. If a driver goes off sick, one of the directors gets behind the wheel. There’s no bus depot, just a corner of a yard rented cheap. Even though he’s paid only a part-time wage, the operations manager, Andrew Lyons, works 60 hours a week and will nip off on a Sunday to wash the buses. At 52, he supplements his earnings by driving a minicab the day we meet, he’s booked to do a midnight run down to Gatwick.West Oxfordshire now fits into a small tradition of alternative bus providers. You can find community bus services in east London and west Norfolk. There are also a few of the old municipal bus companies still kicking about, especially in Nottingham and Edinburgh. Price can see the irony of a local Labour politician forming part of Cameron’s “big society”, in his old parliamentary seat, but she says: “This is about real localism – us doing things for our community who would otherwise be abandoned. That’s a Labour tradition, not a Tory one.”After just 16 months, it not only breaks even, it’s expanding. The fleet has gone from one to four buses (none less than 10 years old). The town service runs “like a Swiss watch”, says Lyons, and throughout our chat his eyes barely rise from the smartphone app that keeps tabs on their progress. Other villages kept petitioning WOCT to run a service for them, so this February it began the 210 to Chipping Norton.The 210 takes you on a trip through what austerity looks like in west Oxfordshire. You go through housing estates barely two decades old littered with bus shelters, yet with hardly any buses now driving through them. You see beautiful rolling plains, while lurching over roads so full of bumps and potholes that, as the driver Dave Hartley says, “It’s like driving over braille.” Yet the passengers are so cheery it feels like you’re off for a bit of five-a-side. Everybody loves these buses, although they swear blind that “it’s the older ones who really benefit”. Even the eightysomethings use that line.A Doncaster transplant, Price says: “I know all about left-behind towns, but here I see so much wealth and investment – then you tell people living on the Smiths estate that we haven’t got this little amount of cash for a bus that enables you to carry on living your life independently.” By the middle of the 2020s, Oxford will have a £7bn trainline and road to Cambridge. This is what growth looks like in today’s Britain: publicly subsidised giveaways to a clutch of businesses, transport companies and estate agents, under the guise of building a “brain belt”. Meanwhile, the pensioners and the less well-off are treated as unwelcome tourists in their own towns.Here is the choice: Britons can throw tens of billions at infrastructure projects that show footloose businesses how needy we are or we can choose policies that serve the everyday economy that the rest of us actually live in. An everyday economy certainly includes buses that help people get around their community rather than only zip along a commuter belt.For all the popularity of its rail policies, Labour has been slow on the wipeout of bus services. It should face down the likes of Stagecoach and call for an end to the current wild west of bus provision outside London. It should plan for other regions to have the same powers over bus services as Sadiq Khan and TfL (as nodded to by Theresa May’s Bus Services Act). Support the establishment of more municipal bus services. And it should compel commercial operators to co-operate with municipal and community bus services and even advertise their routes and timetables.You don’t meet many people like Price and the rest who have set up west Oxfordshire’s newest bus company. One Sunday a month, when the buses are idle, Hartley drives some regulars to a garden centre or to Cirencester for free. For all we expect from public transport, it is a community service and it should be run in that spirit. On one of the few occasions I could get him off tracking the progress of the buses, Lyons explained why he jacked in a decent position with Stagecoach for the hassle of organising a local service.“The bus to these people isn’t just a bus: it’s a social club,” he said. “It’s their whole way of interacting with the world around them. Witney is the world as far as they’re concerned. That matters to me more than a secure job at Stagecoach. It just matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c829830416e75ba155a003e98e533b1251a18009/491_186_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6174efee3a929c122ce57c174626d89","title":"rachel de souza vomit school controversy ofsted","story":"‘Change is necessary. Maybe I put people’s noses out of joint,’ says controversial academy chain chiefThe newspapers couldn’t believe their luck. Last autumn, Barry Smith, headteacher of the new Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, issued policies on behaviour to parents and children. The predecessor school, he wrote, was riddled with indiscipline, bullying and truancy. He would not allow such things. Mobile phones, if seen or heard, would be confiscated for weeks. Pupils must “only ever look at your teacher or where your teacher has directed you to look”. Smith specified “unacceptable” boys’ haircuts including “variations on the style often known as ‘Meet me at McDonald’s’”, a tousled mop with short sides.Most remarkably, he told children not to feign illness to avoid work. “If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! … that’s probably all your body wanted.” After press headlines and angry parents’ protests, Smith modified his “behaviour guide”, parts of which were “tongue in cheek”, with the sick buckets being just “a colourful turn of phrase”.For Dame Rachel de Souza, founder and chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, the chain that runs the academy, the storm was just a routine day’s work. For a small (14 schools) chain, founded in 2013, the trust attracts disproportionate publicity. Some of it is positive. Though several schools required improvement or were in special measures before they joined, the Department for Education puts Inspiration second only to a chain that includes two grammar schools in a league table of multi-academy trusts’ Progress 8 scores. A study by the Education Policy Institute rates its key stage 4 results ahead of every other secondary provider in England, including local authorities. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, was so impressed with De Souza, a steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, that he said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”.De Souza points out that it’s normal for schools to be shown draft Ofsted reports and for inspectors to make second visits after representations. Ministers, in any case, have no power to influence school inspections. So why does she attract so much controversy? “Probably because I think change is necessary and do things wholeheartedly,” she ventures. But several hostile stories, I observe, are based on leaked emails, which suggests she makes enemies among her colleagues. “There were a number of difficult relationships. Perhaps some people’s noses were put out of joint.”De Souza talks at 100mph sentences begin but never finish, as she interrupts herself with new thoughts and anecdotes. “I’m jumping all over the place,” she says.She taught at comprehensives in Oxford, east London and Luton before, at 36, landing her first academy headship, also in Luton. The school, replacing two local authority schools deemed to be “underperforming”, was so difficult that she told her senior team it would probably continue to fail and, at the end of the year, “we could all walk away and get on with our lives”. But for that one year, they should give it everything.“We went totally over the top on every little thing. We would tell them to do their revision and then have a banana. Revise, eat a banana, revise, eat a banana. Year 11 had never had a qualified maths teacher. So I found one and put them all in the hall with him and a stereo mic for two hours each night.” She ordered new uniforms, sent teachers to get children out of bed in the mornings, and introduced assemblies with classical music. Exam results soared.She describes the trust as “a family” with “a feeling of community”, exemplified by an annual “great day” in early September “where we get all the staff together”. Inspiration Trust, like several other academy chains, has a central team of “brilliant subject specialists” hammering out rigorous curriculum content. If a local authority were doing it, it would be described as dictatorial, particularly since there is a heavy emphasis on “core knowledge”, the latest curriculum fashion, which De Souza embraced after visiting ED Hirsch, its guru, in the US. But de Souza insists that the team works closely with teachers and that “we see ourselves as a scholarly community generating new knowledge”.Born in 1968, she had a “wonderful, colourful, interesting childhood”. Her father was Irish, her mother, half-Austrian, half-Hungarian. A Ukrainian step-grandfather encouraged her to learn the language at a Saturday school. At her Catholic school, she was a “very good” student up to 14 but became “quite sociable and not that interested in studying” until the second year at sixth form college. Her religious studies teacher had a degree from London University’s tiny Heythrop College, and De Souza decided to follow him. She met her future husband, now in the probation service, on her first day. “I thought: yes, that’s it.”With a degree in theology and philosophy, “I was advised to shake off my northern help-the-world thing and go and make some money.” She became a trainee accountant. “I thought it was the end of life.” After two weeks, she left to take a teaching certificate at King ’s College, London.Her career – five jobs in the past 15 years – suggests a certain restlessness. There were rumours in 2016 that she would succeed Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector. She laughs and denies that she applied.So what about the “vomit school”? More laughter. “What Barry’s done there is unbelievable,” she tells me. “It’s one of the best examples of sorting out behaviour I’ve ever seen.

The union’s general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: “This woefully inadequate code is nothing more than another plea for restraint to a group of people who have ignored every previous request. “It is staggering that it does not even ban vice-chancellors from attending the meetings where their pay is set. A bizarre gentleman’s agreement where the boss steps outside while their pay is discussed is not how you tackle excessive pay.”Andrew Adonis, the former education minister who has been a vocal critic of vice-chancellor pay levels, said: “At long last the vice-chancellors have taken some basic steps towards good governance. But it’s not just process we need - it’s fundamental changes in behaviour. There needs to be an end to the culture of greed and excess.”The new rules appear unlikely to prevent regulators in England from taking further action, with the Office for Students warning universities would face tougher conditions in justifying high pay.Nicola Dandridge, the OfS chief executive, said the code was “a positive step”, but suggested vice-chancellors needed to “show real leadership” in curbing their salaries.“Later this month, the Office for Students will publish its accounts direction for universities and colleges,” she said.“We will set out our increased expectations around transparency for senior pay, and will be expecting all higher education providers to justify how much those who lead their organisations are paid. Where an institution breaches our regulatory conditions, we will not hesitate to intervene.”The CUC chairman, Chris Sayers, said his committee planned to publish national measures of vice-chancellors’ pay multiples, including the average and the highest quintile – currently 6.4 and above 8 respectively – which would allow outsiders to make comparisons.“The publication of this remuneration code is a major step in tackling the issue of vice-chancellor pay. It provides a strong basis for the sector to demonstrate its commitment to transparency, and I urge all institutions to adopt it and apply it,” Sayers said.The code empowers efforts to stop vice-chancellors taking well-paid external positions such as directorships while in office. They are “generally unlikely to be able retain significant sums”, it states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a370c998455a60fd1d5948b00eacc9c08c0464/0_273_4025_2415/master/4025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f964ca60fc6ce6c8fc299c0729de3e76","title":"h and m change uk womenswear sizes customer frustration","story":"Swedish retailer’s products had long been criticised for being smaller than expectedH\u0026ampM is to change its UK womenswear sizes after years of complaints from customers that the clothes are smaller than expected.“We are taking the steps to change our womenswear measurements to be in line with UK sizing, for example, the previous measurements and fit of a size 12 will now be the measurements of a size 10,” said a spokesperson for the retailer.Parker said she was not “able to pull the jeans past my one thigh”.She went on to question how the retailer could sell pencil cases emblazoned with the word “#GRLPOWER” and T-shirts that say “SISTERHOOD” and expect women to feel empowered, while selling clothes that “do the exact opposite”.The Swedish company has until now translated its European sizes to a lower UK size than the majority of other high street shops, meaning a European 38 would be labelled a UK 12, where in other places it would be a 10.Although H\u0026ampM has begun using the new sizing on labels, the spokesperson said: “This will be a gradual process whereby customers will experience a transition period, and are encouraged to use our sizing guides online or ask our store staff for advice when shopping.”Customers appeared to broadly welcome the change.

He was living on £37.50 a week benefit, and “perfectly happy. I made all my own clothes, I got into all the clubs free.” When the Haçienda nightclub opened in the city, Griffiths went every night without fail for the first six months – “and I didn’t eat anyway, so there was no requirement for food. But there we were, wasted on the sofa, and the news came on that Margaret Thatcher was considering conscription for the Falklands war for the unemployed. So I thought I’d better do something. That’s how I ended up studying fashion.”The brand Max Mara conjures an image of camel coats and conservative northern Italian style, so Ian Griffiths, its designer for three decades, is not what you might expect. The man sitting opposite me in the  canteen – the unstarry interview location was his choice, being close to where he lives when he is in London – is the most influential British designer you have never heard of. With annual sales reported to be more than £1bn, Max Mara is that rare thing, a fashion-week label whose heart is in the real world. For six decades, Max Mara did not have a public-facing designer – a unique move in the gladiatoral arena that is Milan fashion week, where Donatella Versace, Giorgio Armani and Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana are all represented by personalities as well as brands. And then in February last year Griffiths cast Halima Aden in his catwalk show, making Max Mara’s the first Milan show to feature a headscarf-wearing model. Before the show, Griffiths told Luigi Maramotti, the chairman and owner, about the casting. “He said it was fine, but that he hoped it wouldn’t attract too much attention. Of course it did attract attention. But Mr Maramotti was delighted because that reaction was entirely positive.”But at heart, says Griffiths, “Max Mara has always been radical.” He is turned out like an Italian tailor’s fantasy of an Englishman, in a navy double-breasted suit by the tailor Timothy Everest, who has made all his suits to measure for more than two decades. (“Once you get a taste for bespoke, anything else is like wearing a cardboard box.”) The folds of the silk pocket square in his breast pocket and the side parting in his light brown hair both appear to have been drawn with a ruler and compass. He is the most dapper punk you will ever meet, but punk he still is, in his own way. “Max Mara was a very radical new idea when it began in the 1950s. It was about dressing women in order that they could go and be successful in the world – so not a conservative philosophy at all, quite the opposite. There is a great deal said about feminism in fashion at the moment, but Max Mara has been doing this in an under-the-radar way for 40 years.” Griffiths is proud that Max Mara was the first label to take a working woman, rather than a lady of leisure, as its aspirational icon.Griffiths pulls out his phone to show me a portrait taken of him by the renowned music photographer Kevin Cummins around the time he began studying fashion. In it, he is wearing a wedding veil. “That was a time of incredible self-made culture in that city. Ian Brown lived three doors away from our flat we’d see the name Stone Roses scrawled in the stairwell and I’d say to my flatmate, do you think they’re any good? Shall we go and see them? It was a moment when we were making everything up ourselves: our clothes, our music, our image.” As luck would have it, the legendary designer Ossie Clark had just begun teaching fashion when Griffiths arrived at Manchester Poly. “I learned an incredible amount. He got me to think about clothes in relation to the people who would wear them. Once he brought along a corset he was making for Jerry Hall.” He moved on to the Royal College of Art in London, and a part-time job at Browns on South Molton Street, where the celebrated Joan Burstein put him in the new Alaïa section, “because she thought women would trust a man’s opinion over a woman’s, on body conscious clothes”. It was Griffiths’ first encounter with designer fashion. “I was making all my own clothes out of lining material. I couldn’t believe people actually bought such expensive clothes.” All 60 students on his course submitted a project for Max Mara, “except I nearly didn’t, because I was living in a squat in Bloomsbury and, the night before hand-in, I was still working on it when my felt pen ran out at 2.30am. I thought, oh well, might as well give up and go to bed. And just then my flatmate Trish, who had been clubbing, came in from Taboo and lent me a pen.” Luigi Maramotti, the son of Achille, asked Griffiths to go to Italy for a meeting he joined directly after his graduation. But then, many of Max Mara’s Reggio Emilia workers “have been there all their lives. I have worked with my right-hand person for 28 years and that is quite normal for our company.”The secret to the eternal appeal of Italian fashion, says Griffiths, is that “it is primarily about making you look and feel beautiful. It’s not about being an experimental canvas for outrageous ideas. The best of Italian culture – in art, in food, as well as fashion – always attempts to present as something accessible.” Home is a first-floor apartment in a 15th-century building. “Our palazzo – listen to me! Our palazzo, in the middle of our street, ha, ha – is like something out of The Talented Mr Ripley. We are adjacent to the bishop’s palace, so I get an Easter card from the bishop.” When not working, Griffiths and his partner, Mark, ide their time between Islington and a cottage in Suffolk. “You wouldn’t recognise me if you saw me in the country. I’ll be up to my elbows in soil in the garden and Mark will say, ‘Can you please at least put your jumper on the right way round?’ But I am never not thinking about work. If I am walking the dogs, I will be listening to the show music, thinking about the collection.”Now, Griffiths’ personal profile is growing fast. “I didn’t go into fashion to be famous, so I don’t need for it to be ‘Max Mara by Ian Griffiths’ – I’m not that egotistical.” Nonetheless, he smiles when he says that “when I’d been with the brand 25 years, there was a feeling that I could be trusted. I felt that if the brand had a voice it could connect better with women. The collections we have shown since I was given a voice have been more emphatic. I can talk about things more clearly, now.” About making the catwalk a platform for ersity, he says, “I prefer the world ‘normalcy’. Because that’s what it is. If you walk down Bond Street it is completely normal to see a woman in a headscarf wearing a Max Mara coat, so it should be normal on the catwalk as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dbfe7587d59a333f8a1c6e7b6c2bb27928c612a/0_47_5668_3400/master/5668.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b50e29dd4d5999205e3a4736af964b","title":"oceans 8 review rating all female reboot","story":"Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Rihanna head up a gender-swapped take on Ocean’s Eleven that suffers from an absence of tension One of the many joys of Steven Soderbergh’s 2001 remake of heist caper Ocean’s Eleven was the experience of watching an auteur, whose work had previously existed primarily in the independent sphere, take charge of a splashy, star-packed studio film. The crackling sexual tension and snappy dialogue of his 1998 thriller Out of Sight gave us a clue that he would be a steady hand with such material but still, his ability to deliver such a dizzyingly entertaining blockbuster on such a large scale came as a warm surprise.The razzle-dazzle was starting to dim by the time Ocean’s Thirteen was released in 2007 but Soderbergh’s confident direction was a swaggering force that lifted the franchise even in its silliest moments. Cut to 11 years later and the format is being refreshed, rebooted, retooled and remixed with key changes in front and behind of the camera. Soderbergh has retreated, with just a producer’s credit, and he’s been replaced in the director’s chair by Gary Ross, whose uneven career has careered from Pleasantville to Seabiscuit to The Hunger Games to Free State of Jones. While he boasts experience with big names and big budgets, artfulness and anything resembling audacity aren’t closely associated with his work and having been spoiled by Soderbergh’s eye, we inevitably approach Ocean’s 8 with caution.But in front of the camera, there’s far less to worry about. In a nifty, if increasingly familiar, update, the all-male crew has been gender-swapped and there’s a tantalizing cast onboard with three Oscar winners, one Oscar nominee, one Grammy winner, one Emmy winner, one SAG award winner and one rising star all teaming up. The connection to the previous series is familial with Sandra Bullock playing Debbie Ocean, the sister to her Gravity co-star George Clooney’s now-deceased Danny Ocean. The film begins as she is released from prison after a five-year stint, insisting that her return to the outside world will be boringly normal, a far cry from her previous life as a con artist.Within minutes however, she’s back to her old tricks: lying, cheating, stealing and reuniting with her old partner in crime Lou (Cate Blanchett). Debbie has a plan, one that she’s been working on every day that she’s been inside, and it will require the pair to assemble a team of specialists. Together they recruit a weed-smoking hacker (Rihanna), an emotionally fragile fashion designer (Helena Bonham Carter), a maternally smothered jeweler (Mindy Kaling), a street-smart pickpocket (Awkwafina) and one of Debbie’s former partners (Sarah Paulson). The target is movie star Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), or more specifically the Cartier necklace they will persuade her to wear before stealing it while she attends the Met Gala, arguably New York’s hottest event of the year.It sounds like a blast and at times, during the first act it almost is, but while great care has been taken in populating the film with infinitely talented performers, there’s been less attention paid to the pros behind the scenes. While Ocean’s Eleven glided through its many sharp set pieces, Ocean’s 8 inelegantly plods. The smoothness of Soderbergh’s concoction, often smug yet mostly rather charming, has been replaced with a bland impersonality, the work of a disinterested hired hand. Snappy, playful camerawork and a deft David Holmes score are sorely missed as Ross fills his film with plainly shot montages of superficial luxury that fail to feel quite as sumptuous as they should.We know the format at play here and the script, co-written by Ross with up-and-coming screenwriter Olivia Milch, struggles to lend a fresh tone to the formula. Despite the comic skills of the cast, there’s a noticeable lack of wit, a glaring hole in place of the back-and-forth banter from its predecessor. So many scenes feel a couple of drafts away from flying despite best intentions of the cast.Bullock remains a magnetic screen presence and she tries her darnedest with featherlight characterization but her knack for comedy is left underexplored. Like the crew members who surround her, she’s not really allowed much more depth than just her criminal skill. Everyone is defined by their job rather than their personality. Rihanna isn’t given anything interesting to do outside of her laptop, Bonham Carter is a collection of overplayed tics, Hathaway has some fun vamping it up and, regrettably, Blanchett is particularly underserved, her actions mostly perfunctory. There are also brief flashes of brilliance from Awkwafina (who is set to steal this summer’s Crazy Rich Asians) but again, the script doesn’t feed her with the moments she needs to really soar. The film keeps threatening to loosen up and allow the women the freedom to recreate the fun, hangout vibe that made Soderbergh’s film such a rush, but there’s a glaring incompetency here in Ross bringing such talents together and not knowing what the hell to do with them. After building up to the main event, there’s a vague hope that things will finally sing during the heist. But instead of being smart and surprising, it’s sloppy and predictable. Whenever the crew encounters a problem that might bring some much-needed tension, it’s fixed within seconds. The suspense evaporates, and so does our investment.The lifeless direction, the unrefined script, the underwhelming cameos, the distinct lack of fizz – there’s a slapdash nature to the assembly of Ocean’s 8 that makes it feel like the result of a rushed, often careless process. It’s made watchable thanks to the cast but star power alone cannot mask creative inadequacy. Stealing a diamond necklace is bad but wasting an opportunity like this is unforgivable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fe0ac56da7bbfacc4cebe2c85f5ca5fa8bd3230/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=e0208ba56bd1175b8611b555666df4fa","title":"planning my wedding as a non binary bride","story":"‘I couldn’t even pick a pronoun. How was I supposed to decide what costume to wear on one of the most important days of my life?’I never wanted to be a princess in white. I wasn’t one of those little girls who dreams of her wedding day – I wasn’t a girl at all. I saw myself as grubby, an animal. I was happiest in overalls and didn’t mind when other people asked me if I was a boy or a girl. I liked being difficult to nail down.When I was young, there was no word for what I was – or what I was not. Even now, the words we have are incomplete. I struggle to describe myself. “Not a girl” is usually as far as I get. The closest our language has so far for a person like me is “non-binary,” meaning I exist outside the “masculine” and “feminine” gender norms. It means that, walking down the block, I will get called both “sir” and “ma’am” before I even cross the street – and neither will be right.When I met my first husband, I was in boys’ clothes. He said I looked like Ramona Quimby, the scruffy, mischievous girl from Beverly Cleary’s iconic children’s books. We rode our bikes everywhere through Portland, as though every day was summer vacation. But as the relationship progressed, I could tell that he needed me to be feminine. He craved it. If I ever looked or acted like a girl, it owned him, totally.Once, I put on a thrift store denim tube dress and went to visit him at the coffee shop where he worked. I was the only one there. He came around the counter and stood over me, too close. The look on his face – shock, total possession – frightened me. He crowded me into a corner and put his hands on the wall on either side of my head. I could smell his cigarette breath. The rough bricks were sandpaper against my naked back. He was a tall man, almost six and a half feet, with 40 pounds on me. In that skimpy shred of fabric, I felt very small. Like I couldn’t possibly get away.“You’re supposed to be working,” I said.“When you come in here, looking like that?” he growled. “What did you think was going to happen?”Our wedding was tiny – just us, our witnesses and the priest. His eyes followed me, taking in every detail. My milk-colored silk gown was heavy, but I still shivered, as though I was wearing nothing at all.I held his fingers while we promised to love and cherish one another forever, but I sensed it was not me he loved. It was the dress. And because I was not a woman, I could not fulfill the promises I made him. They weren’t my promises this wasn’t my part to play. I could only be the thing that I was. I was deeply closeted at the time, and it hurt to be seen as a bride. A woman. A wife. I held my husband’s hand and I ached. When I tried to repeat the vows, my eyes leaked. I wasn’t crying because I was moved. I cried because I was a fool, and I knew it, and because it hurt to pretend to be something I was not.The marriage lasted three crummy years, and then I left.I kept my wedding dress. It was gorgeous, a gift from my uncle Brian, not something to be parted with lightly. He made the bespoke Grace Kelly number with a full tea length, godet skirt with hand embroidered panels. For the first fitting, I stood in Brian’s sewing room in my underwear, fidgeting, while he measured me for the design.“You’ve got a bubble butt,” he teased, taking two extra hip measurements to accommodate it.He pinned the muslin pattern pieces around me, adjusting for fit. I tried to relax. I’d need space in this dress to bend, eat, breathe. Brian pinned the panels closer, adding pins where the muslin needed to follow the curves of my body. He knelt to check the pins around my hips. He marked a place over each knee, pinched the fabric, and tested its draping. The skirt would flare from here.He looked up at me and smiled. I remember his warning: “Don’t gain or lose too much weight, or I’ll have to redo everything,” he said. “The corset already has fourteen bones in it.”If I changed too much, he’d have to add or take away. One alteration would change the proportions of the entire dress, a month of minor, careful adjustments to preserve the integrity of the pattern and the durability of the garment. The entire process was thousands of hours of hand work. I nodded, promising.Do I need to say that I failed to stay the same? The small ways I changed, from my pronouns to my self-expression, transformed my life in colossal, unpredictable ways. Every tiny adjustment altered the pattern.As I got older, I learned more. The words we used to talk about queerness changed the people I dated were more accepting and open-minded. I liked dating men because I could borrow their clothes. As I settled into what I am, I changed my terms: I identified as a dyke, a tomboy. Underneath those secondhand plaids and Carhartt overalls, though, was somebody who was still wearing the wrong body.I started seeing Charlie five years after my first marriage ended. Our first coffee date, I was charmed by his intelligence, humor, and athletic good looks. He was traditional, yet deviant a lawyer with a wild streak, a community-minded, policy-loving geek. He wore thick glasses and, when he took them off, his eyes were a shade of hazel that made my knees wobble. I didn’t know if he’d see me again, but then there was another date, and another one, and then we were in a relationship and every day, it seemed, I fell more in love with him. We talked about everything: I knew he was progressive, liked queer women, and was attracted to my fluid self-expression. He was, he said, secure enough in his masculinity to enjoy whatever I was putting out there.When I told him I was trans, I could feel him absorbing each syllable as it left my mouth. He took my news, and my feelings about it, seriously.“I’m in a body that isn’t saying the right things. It’s not me,” I explained. “I feel like I’m wearing a rubber suit all the time and nobody can see me inside it.”“I see you,” he said. I knew he did. I felt it.He asked me if I was going to change my name, or my body, and I said I wasn’t ready to decide yet. I was going to take my time, and not try to sharpen the undefined parts of myself. I wanted to ease into myself – as though I had all the time in the world.Although I took my time with myself, I also took steps to own my queerness. I started coming out in public, writing about my identity, and making an effort to be more visible. In one viral video, I shared that I was non-binary trans. One of the commenters said that I may as well just tell people I am a seahorse.Seahorses: a species of role reversal. The males carry the fry, and the females drift through the plankton layer of the ocean, spawning when the mood takes them. The comment stung it meant that I was somehow unnatural. My gender was nonsense.Charlie proposed to me on a night in July, with a ring he’d designed himself. We were eating ice cream on a park bench, and he pulled out the small, navy box.The ring was a thick band of beaten platinum, set with dozens of diamonds in a pinprick design of a mountain range. I took it from him and slipped it on. Charlie smiled at me.“It’s perfect,” I said.“I wanted something that you didn’t have to take off to punch someone,” he joked. “Something tough and beautiful at the same time.”I leaned forward and kissed the vanilla ice cream off his lips. “It’s perfect,” I said again, because it was. Both delicate and weighty, it hugged my finger when I reached to touch Charlie’s face.I was excited to be married, but there were difficult steps to take first. Here was another wedding to plan, and another wedding dress. What does a seahorse wear to their wedding? I couldn’t even pick a pronoun. How was I supposed to decide what costume to wear on one of the most important days of my life?Was I going to be a wife again? Do you take this woman? If I came out, or changed my gender legally, could we even get a license?Eleven years after my first wedding, I’m getting ready for my second, and I still do not feel like a bride.When I searched for “queer wedding,” I found images of happy, nontraditional ceremonies: husbands hugging, wives kissing. Many of them were masculine-feminine couples. I also found femme couples in matching gowns, butch women in tuxedos. They looked happy. I saw photos of binary trans brides and grooms, beaming at the camera. After a while, these pictures blurred together. It is beautiful, sure, but it was more of the same: malefemale, masculinefeminine, and suitgown. I couldn’t envision myself in those roles. My sense of being the odd one out intensified.I asked Charlie if he was going to wear a suit to our wedding.“Maybe we should both wear suits,” I suggested. “Since, you know. Me.” I imagined us side by side, two tall, athletic blondes in matching tuxedos. Shook my head. We’d look like a pair of grooms, and I wasn’t eligible for that role, either.“Suits would be fine.”“When you close your eyes, and imagine your wedding, what do you see?” I asked.He closed his eyes. He was quiet.“I see a beautiful bubble of pure light,” he finally said.“You don’t see a white dress and a veil and stuff?”“I just see you,” he said, and kissed me. I stopped looking up “genderfluid wedding” and “transgender wedding” after that. I found an image of Grace Kelly, this time in a blue gown so tailored that she looked like an aerofoil. The gown in the picture was silk, with a chiffon skirt, one Kelly wore in “To Catch a Thief.” The sheath had two nearly invisible straps, and was swathed in transparent, sky blue gauze. A goddess, emerging from a cloud. The bodice was sculpted in folds and layers, making the gown look like a classical Grecian statue. That’s how I wanted to feel on my wedding day: powerful, calm, self-possessed, strong. I didn’t feel that way in a suit – or in a frilly, ultra femme dress. Maybe the answer was something architectural, for me. Something that wasn’t really human at all.My uncle generously offered to make this second wedding dress, too. He assured me that, the second time around, there are no rules. Wear red, he said. Wear a muumuu. Do whatever you want. He wouldn’t have time to sew a suit jacket, but we could discuss another couture design.“Your measurements haven’t changed since college,” my uncle said. “You’ve still got that butt.”He liked the photo of Grace, and immediately started explaining how many tucks he’d have to put across each shoulder seam to get the toga effect we wanted. The gauze would need to drape from the shoulder, and follow the line of the bodice. I hadn’t told him that I fantasized about top surgery and hormones that would make my upper body thicken. I didn’t share the worries I’d felt building since my engagement: my fear that I would be a bad wife again, that I was forcing myself into a role that simply didn’t fit, that I would disappoint my new husband like I had my last one.The sewing room, piled high with bolts of fabric, half-finished projects, and trim, was quiet. My uncle’s husband was singing in the kitchen, loading a pod into the coffee maker. I swallowed hard, my own voice suddenly stuck in my throat.“The design I showed you was very…feminine,” I finally said.He nodded. He’d found the perfect blue silk already, the color of a September afternoon.“We’ll need to make sure the bustier is in good shape before we put in the plastic boning or do anything else,” he said. “All those pin tucks. It’s like origami.”I could feel my hands starting to sweat. “The thing is,” I said.He looked at me.“The thing is, I’ve changed a lot since my first wedding. I think I’d be happier in an even simpler design,” I finally blurted out. I looked at his face carefully. What if I offended him?

I want to look completely sleek. Elegant.”He nodded again, made a couple of notes beside the column of my measurements. “It will be obviously simple.”“Aerodynamic,” I said, and he looked at me and I could tell that he knew. I may as well have told him I wanted to dress up like a seahorse.“We can do that,” he said.

It is potentially anachronistic when children are watching on-demand at any time of the day.”The news may disappoint Oliver, who made Jamie’s School Dinners for the channel in 2005, when he helped focus media attention on children’s diets by launching a war on Turkey twizzlers.“Jamie is obviously free to have his agenda,” said Allan. “We fund and commission loads of great shows about health and if we’ve got less money we can afford to put less shows like that out.”Channel 4 launched its annual report on Tuesday, the first under its new leadership team of Mahon and director of programmes Ian Katz, a former Newsnight boss and deputy editor of the . They have pledged to focus on attracting a younger audience with investments into E4 and online programming.The commercial broadcaster, which is ultimately publicly owned, said revenues fell from £995m to £960m in 2017, amid a weak advertising market.

A subsequent law created an offence of knowingly leasing a property to a disqualified person, with a maximum jail term of five years.One of the many problems faced by people caught up in the Windrush scandal has been the inability to find anywhere to live when they cannot prove their immigration status.The letter, whose signatories include Diane Abbott, Harriet Harman, Joanna Cherry, Ben Lake, Caroline Lucas and Tom Brake, cited a report from March on the right to rent scheme by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI), David Bolt.The report found right to rent “had yet to demonstrate its worth as a tool to encourage immigration compliance”, Bolt said, making a series of recommendations for change.The letter noted that the ICIBI “was particularly concerned with the lack of any monitoring or evaluation mechanisms that would allow the government to ascertain whether the scheme was having its intended effect, or whether it is creating unintended consequences”.It said the government had refused to implement one of his recommendations – an improved landlords’ consultative panel – and had seemed unwilling to properly monitor the effect of the scheme.“The Windrush scandal has drawn attention to the effects of the so-called hostile environment,” the letter said. “It also provides a stark warning of the consequences that can be expected when ministers and officials fail to respond to the repeated warnings of experts about the impact of their policies.”While the best option would be to immediately end the scheme, the letter said, at the very least ministers should commit to evaluating it properly, particularly how it might make people homeless, or at risk of modern slavery and trafficking.It ended: “We therefore ask that you implement the recommendations set out by the ICIBI as a matter of urgency.”A Home Office spokesman said: “The term ‘hostile environment’ as a description of Home Office immigration policy is incorrect, unhelpful and does not represent our values as a country. “We noted the Independent Chief Inspectors’ recommendations on the right to rent scheme and we continue to take steps to ensure it is implemented and communicated as effectively as possible. “The Home Office engaged extensively with a variety of groups prior to the roll out of the right to rent scheme and it has been subject to evaluation, which found no evidence that the scheme was causing unlawful discrimination, homelessness or additional burdens on local authorities.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3041cc885c5b3a039167aa6c6e1d65d3df8e16f0/0_345_4172_2504/master/4172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba5ef6546a4a55df6614a3456e572160","title":"metoo madama butterfly puccini geisha opera women exploitation","story":"Puccini’s Orientalist story of the sexual exploitation of an Asian woman may seem repulsive in the #metoo era – but we shouldn’t flinch from a masterpiece’s savagery, says the director of Glyndebourne’s latest productionGiacomo Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, premiered in Milan in 1904, is perhaps the most sordid story in the operatic canon – although there is no shortage of competition. Lieutenant BF Pinkerton, a naval officer from the USS Lincoln, is posted in Nagasaki. While there, aided by Goro, an unscrupulous Japanese marriage broker, he lures the fatherless, impoverished 15-year-old Butterfly into a temporary union. Thinking she is legally married, Butterfly abandons her Buddhist faith for Christianity and is renounced by her family and friends. Despite his strong attraction to her, and the warnings of the local US consul Sharpless, Pinkerton then deserts Butterfly, but tells her he will return to take her back to America.Three years of waiting pass, during which time Butterfly secretly gives birth to his child with no one but her servant and companion Suzuki for support. When Pinkerton finally returns to Japan it is with his “real” American wife, Kate. On discovering the existence of his son they decide to take the child from Butterfly and back to America. Butterfly agrees to what she sees as a better life for her son and kills herself so he is not tormented in his adult years by his mother’s abandonment.How do we as a modern audience of the #MeToo era experience this musical masterpiece, written by a white European man about the sexual exploitation and death of an Asian woman? How do we reconcile our enjoyment of this opera while acknowledging that it is an iconic example of Orientalism by a composer who never set foot in Japan? And how do we honour a desire to be true to the realities of the story when the Japanese characters are so often performed by western singers, an issue in an industry that must now confront its notable lack of ersity? None of these issues can be solved by one production – but never has it been more important for a director to grant Madama Butterfly a clear-eyed examination of the unpalatable realities of its libretto.And what a libretto it is. Puccini went through five versions of the piece with his writers Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica until he achieved what we have today: a precise, ruthless exploration of how a near-powerless woman is bought and sold to a pleasure-seeking westerner. It is significant that Puccini, who could not speak English, first saw the play (by David Belasco) that inspired his libretto in London. The piece inflicts on Butterfly a patronising and infantilising cod-English dialogue that would be unacceptable on a modern stage and would have been alienating then. Puccini’s lack of English meant he could transcend the indignity of her speech to see the inherent humanity of Butterfly. As a result, he defended her from any accusation of collusion in her own misfortune by creating an original Act 1 to flesh out the deliberate detail of her deception. Consequently, in Pinkerton they created one of the most morally bankrupt characters in opera – so unpleasant that Puccini had to be persuaded to sympathetically expand the role or risk having tenors reject the part as too small and seedy to perform. He was determined that his audience should see the seduction and corruption of the innocent Butterfly as a conscious choice by Pinkerton. We hear that Butterfly is only 15 years old three times over, as she, Sharpless and Pinkerton drive the point home relentlessly. “The age of playthings,” Sharpless says. “And of sweetmeats,” replies Pinkerton shortly after toasting “the day on which I’ll wed in real marriage, a real wife from America”.Faced with such an unequivocal libretto, it is a directorial duty not to be squeamish about presenting the story of this opera. In order to make as vivid as possible the disparity in the power dynamic between Pinkerton and Butterfly, the production I have created for Glyndebourne is set in the early 1950s. In the aftermath of the second world war, the War Brides Act allowed American servicemen who married abroad to bring their foreign wives home, thus enabling Japanese women to go to America in large numbers. This meant lucrative business for marriage brokers such as our Goro, in whose bustling and obviously profitable office Act 1 is set. Butterfly’s wish to go to the US to start a new life with Pinkerton comes across particularly strongly when he is only one of many men who were facilitated by Japanese society to marry young local women. Some of these relationships had happy outcomes some not. Our protagonists are part of a bigger story that validates and reinforces Pinkerton’s unthinking, sometimes callous behaviour. We use original footage from 1950s newsreels showing Japanese women “learning to be an American wife” to illustrate how Butterfly might have been manipulated into imagining such a future. Watching these films and directing this story from the perspective of a privileged modern woman is sobering. It’s easy to be seduced into thinking of Madama Butterfly as a story from the past, a melodramatic opera that can be approached as a period piece. But this is a story that still manifests itself in many different reports in newspapers across the world today: the same pattern of western exploitation of vulnerable women can be seen in places such as Haiti.And yet the opera is filled with moments of glorious, uninhibitedly romantic music, and this ecstasy is as much an integral part of this production as the dark subject matter. The near-mythic status this piece has in the operatic canon is due to its amazing combination of brutality and beauty, and that is both its strength and its weakness. This musical allure must never dull the unpleasantness of the story – it must be remembered that the first audience who heard Madama Butterfly in La Scala in 1904 ridiculed the piece, and shouted obscenities at the character of Butterfly.Therefore, to wallow in his orchestral beauty and ignore the hard truth of the libretto that inspired it is to disrespect both Puccini and the many real, anonymous Butterflies past and present who haunt every bar of this savage masterpiece. Puccini’s opera joins the long list of works of art that after years of unquestioning admiration are now problematic in our more enlightened modern times. But to continue to grapple with the story of Madama Butterfly, much as Puccini did himself, is to honour the empathetic impulse that inspired its creation: the strange and wonderful connection between an Italian opera composer and his imaginary geisha."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59e7f520f069376c91e227b8f9fb3091e3ddffb4/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df3e17e6cc2d992b636e617ce49f9c3","title":"a bright peafowl and a spacecraft blessing tuesdays best photos","story":"’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world, including a Hawaiian eruption and a marathon swimmer in Japan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82e08aa3ba94f5c0ddfdf0ca3b18061c467c1b3/0_30_4162_2498/master/4162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8c33129777ce4d7476116a83d9deb6","title":"labour reveals scheme to maintain access to eu single market","story":"Keir Starmer insists ‘internal market’ proposal will deliver full access to the single market, with no new impediments to tradeLabour is proposing an “internal market” that would deliver a new and close relationship with the European Union but falls short of membership of the single market while maintaining many of its advantages.The proposal was heralded by some as the party’s most significant move so far towards a soft Brexit.But the move stops just short of calling for the full single market membership sought by a vocal group of Labour MPs, after the Lords backed a Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area (EEA).Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.”The proposal, tabled as an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill ahead of its return to the Commons next Tuesday, fleshes out proposals originally made in a speech by Jeremy Corbyn in Coventry in February.Corbyn said: “We are confident we can build a new relationship with the EU. We want the UK to have a better deal than the Norway model.”The timing reflects anxiety among the party leadership about a looming revolt by pro-EU backbenchers on EEA membership.Labour peers ambushed the party leadership last month when the amendment, tabled by Lord Alli, demanded that remaining a member of the EEA was a negotiating objective.The EU’s single market is more than a free-trade area. It aims to remove not just the fiscal barriers to trade (tariffs) but the physical and technical barriers (borders and ergent product standards) too by allowing as free movement as possible of goods, capital, services and people. In essence, it is about treating the EU as a single trading territory.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Although EU negotiators have repeatedly made it clear that there can be no cherry picking to the UK’s advantage in the negotiations, Starmer insists the new proposal would deliver full access to the single market, backed by EU-agreed standards, rights and protections. There would be shared UK-EU institutions and regulations, and no new impediments to trade.“Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result,” he said. “Labour’s amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market.”But Chris Leslie, a leading Labour remainer, said: “If the frontbench are missing the opportunity to secure the EEA single market as a UK negotiating objective, there will be utter dismay and shock across the Labour movement.”Another Labour rebel said the leadership had “scrapped the Lords amendment (which is the only one the Tories will support) and replaced it with fudge”.Former Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said the party should back the Lords push for EEA membership instead.The Labour MP said Tory MPs “won’t vote for a Labour frontbench amendment” and if the party was “serious” about averting a hard Brexit “we must vote for the existing backbench cross-party Lords amendment”.Some Tory rebels are also looking at some form of relationship as close to the EEA as possible, as a way of averting a catastrophic departure from the EU.Membership of the EEA itself is incompatible with either Theresa May’s red lines or Jeremy Corbyn’s concerns about the restrictions it would place on the ability of government to intervene in industry or procurement.Members of the EEA such as Norway, which is not in the EU, belong to the single market but – as Norway’s prime minister made clear in an interview on Tuesday – that means accepting the so-called “four freedoms”, including freedom of movement.The official deadline for new amendments to the EU withdrawal bill falls on Thursday and Tory rebels are increasingly optimistic that the government is ready to make concessions.Officially the government is committed to reversing all 15 of the defeats inflicted by the Lords on the key piece of legislation that must be passed before the process of leaving the EU can begin.But on Tuesday night one senior backbencher who has led revolts in the past suggested that were signs of movement by the government on a meaningful vote. The amendment was one of the most significant victories in the Lords. It would prevent May offering only a take-it-or-leave-it vote on the final deal and give parliament a role in negotiations.Iain Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiter, also accepted that there could be some acceptable concessions, including on the “meaningful vote”.The European Union is a customs union. It allows free trade between countries inside it and allows imports in to the area by setting common tariffs. The area does not just include EU members. For instance, Turkey is part of the customs union for manufactured goods but not services or agriculture. The single market involves deeper integration of free movement of people, goods, services and money. This means laws need to be aligned. Some countries have access to the single market without being members of the EU’s customs union.“This bill is the critical bill. The government is right to bring it forward. It defines our departure, and it defines our negotiations,” he said, pointing out that MPs nodded the bill through on its third reading in the Commons earlier this year.Brexiters believe getting the withdrawal bill on the statute book before the key European council meeting at the end of June – barely a fortnight away – would strengthen May’s hand in negotiations, as there will be no prospect of her being forced by parliament to accept, for example, a customs union.There are likely to be other revolts, however. Rebels believe the Lords amendment tabled by the architect of article 50, Lord Kerr, on the customs union, could be upheld in the Commons. It would require the government to make a statement outlining its efforts to negotiate a customs union.That vote could be a key test of opinion in the Commons ahead of a more substantive amendment to the trade bill that has been tabled by Tory rebels.There is also likely to be a significant row over the scheduling of the consideration of the amendments. Only one day has been set aside to consider all amendments, which could mean an all-night sitting on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31eafb6302640b28bc2ef43a6c09cc370dc33eaa/0_174_4317_2590/master/4317.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45dac66708709793dc8c379ae0ab1c94","title":"forbes top 100 no women mayweather","story":"The retired boxer Floyd Mayweather has reclaimed first place from Cristiano Ronaldo in Forbes’ 2018 list of the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes – but for the first time since 2010 there was not a single female on the list.Serena Williams, winner of 23 grand slam tennis singles titles, was the sole female representative last year but she has since largely been inactive, owing to pregnancy and giving birth to her daughter Alexis in September.

I cannot give you any answer. I’m just not thinking about tennis at the moment.”He looked shattered by the experience – but the day belonged to Cecchinato, an underdog from central casting.The Sicilian created mayhem, drama and history when he outlasted the once inexhaustible, 12-majors champion 6-3, 7-6 (4), 1-6, 7-6 (11), in just under three and a half hours to reach the semi-finals. There he will meet the world No 8, Dominic Thiem, who earlier saw off an injured Alexander Zverev in straight sets.Cecchinato in 2016 was convicted of match-fixing but had the ruling overturned on a technicality and here has embraced the experience like an ingenu – as he should, having lost in the first round of his four previous major championships. “Maybe I’m sleeping,” he said courtside. “It’s amazing. It’s unbelievable to beat Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros. I don’t understand nothing. I was so tired but I won the match and it’s amazing. For me it’s a first semi-final of a grand slam. Now I need some rest for recovery. I am very happy.”Djokovic, who memorably came from two sets down to beat a rampant Roger Federer in the 2011 US Open semi-finals, could not replicate those heroics against the world No\u0026nbsp72.The Serb had his chances to force it to a fifth set, 4-1 up in the fourth, and three set-points in the tie-break – but two glaring errors cost him. He butchered a simple volley on a set point that sailed into the stands – provoking a desperate castigation of the crowd – then, on the third match point, he allowed Cecchinato’s fine but gettable shot down the line to sail to safety past his impotent racket. It was a curiously downbeat end to a passage of tennis to rank with any of recent times.In the first two hours Cecchinato was inspired and in the final half or so he returned to those levels against probably the greatest survivor in modern tennis. He had won only one five-setter in his life – coming from two sets down to beat the unseeded Romanian Marius Copil here in the first round – while Djokovic had won 29 of 37 and four times had recovered from 2-0 down.Zverev, meanwhile, leaves Paris weary but unbowed after his resistance finally cracked. Thiem is in the semi-finals for the third year in a row. The German, though, must first inspect a strained hamstring that neutered his movement and power from the third game onwards.“I definitely thought about it,” Zverev said when asked if he considered quitting. “But I didn’t want to pull out for the first time of my career in a grand slam quarter-final. I could barely move. I couldn’t serve. I couldn’t really do anything.”It was Zverev’s twin misfortune to find his good friend strong and in near-perfect touch on a day when his own body finally gave up on him after dragging himself into the quarter-finals through three five-setters, two of which he had to win from two-sets-to-one down. Time finally ran out for him on a cool and cloudy afternoon, Thiem wrapping it up in an hour and 50 minutes, 6-4, 6-2, 6-1.Nobody in the modern era has won four five-set matches in a row and Zverev did well to get this far. But, when he got injured in the first set, his mission against the world No\u0026nbsp8, the only player to have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the past couple of seasons, moved from monumental to near impossible.As the scoreline suggests, Zverev weakened from that point, although his resolve remained intact. Serving at 40-15 in the third game of the first set, he pulled up clutching the thigh. Thereafter it was not a proper contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008638118fad8147c0960b7c1303d3ec7658c026/0_300_3662_2198/master/3662.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb5f22ec2db63608645775cba63e5bd","title":"test cricket mark lathwell dom bess","story":"Some shots linger, so that years later you can still see their shape, hear their sound, when about everything else has faded. Mark Lathwell hit a lot of those in his early years. There’s one in particular his old team-mate Neil Burns can still see, from the summer of 1992. A pull off Courtney Walsh that “disappeared like a tracer bullet at head height through midwicket and blasted into the boundary boards”. Walsh laid waste to the counties in ’92 seven for 27, six for 42, six for 21, six for 33, seven for 38. But one morning in Taunton he was mastered by Lathwell, a 20-year-old kid in his first full season.Anyone who was around English cricket in the 1990s knows the bones of Lathwell’s story. What’s forgotten now, is just how good he was in those early seasons. “The wider cricket world was denied the chance to see what I, and several others, witnessed first-hand,” Burns wrote 20 years later. “He was touched by genius, and in the first half of 1993, he displayed it virtually every time he batted.” Back then, Marcus Trescothick was only the second best young batsman at the club. Lathwell had a talent, Trescothick wrote, “that sometimes left you speechless”.It wasn’t just the runs, but the way he made them. Burns remembers another game against Glamorgan, when Steve Watkin was tearing in. Lathwell made 70 out of 75 for three. At lunch Viv Richards said he’d pick him for Test cricket tomorrow. A month later, England did. But Test cricket wasn’t Lathwell’s game. Mike Atherton recalled how, in that first match, he told Lathwell: “Good luck, the crowd are rooting for you”, and Lathwell said back: “They won’t be in a minute when I’m on my way back.” Alec Stewart reckoned Lathwell “was the one England player of my era who I believe just didn’t want to be there”.Lathwell played two Tests against Australia, 25 years ago this summer, and was never picked again. Earlier that same year, in April, the  sent David Foot along to Taunton to interview him. “Publicity bothers me, I simply can’t see why anyone should be interested,” Lathwell told Foot. “I’m not by nature outgoing. If I don’t know someone, I’m apt to go into the corner.” Stewart remembered that Lathwell “barely said a word” when he was with England, “despite all our efforts to involve him in conversations, we couldn’t drag anything out of him”.Burns always felt Lathwell would rather be “in his local, playing darts and chewing the fat”. And that was where Lathwell fetched up when he unexpectedly quit Somerset in 2001, after a year in which he’d scored eight fifties and two hundreds for the club. Back home, batting for Braunton in the Devon League. Which brings us round about to Devon’s latest Test cricketer, Dom Bess. Braunton is on the far coast from Sidmouth, where Bess played a lot of his club cricket, but the Besses and the Lathwells are two of the county’s cricket families, and their stories are intertwined.Dom’s three cousins still play for Sidmouth, Lathwell’s two sons have done for Bideford and Braunton. One of them came through the county’s under-13 team the season after Dom had moved on up a year. There’s a lot of “Lathwell b Bess” and “Bess c Lathwell” entries in the league’s scorebooks, and both names are engraved on the cup given each year to the county’s best young cricketer, though the dates are a generation apart. The real reason they are a pair, though, is that despite their living so close together, they seem so very far apart. Bess took to Test cricket like a fish to water, Lathwell like a fish to the bank.It seems unlikely that in 20 years’ time any of Dom Bess’s team-mates will be waxing about how breathtaking his talent was, will be talking about his deliveries the way Lathwell’s do his strokes. Even those who know him are unsure he’s got all the skills he will need to hold down his place in the Test team. But what he does have, everyone agrees, is the appetite for it. “The one thing we knew we were going to get from Dom was that character,” said Joe Root on Sunday. “He was padded up for 45 minutes on Saturday night, desperate to get out there as nightwatchman. That’s the sort of player he is.”Bess took up spin-bowling because, he says, he was a “porky” kid who didn’t want to run in for more than five or six strides. His approach to the game changed when he met Darren Veness, who was strength and conditioning coach at Somerset, and now works for Surrey. Veness says he taught him that “whilst talent is respected, it comes behind hard work and discipline”. He remembers Bess as a “very adept and understanding learner”, “not shy of graft, someone who is always looking for the angles, looking for the opportunities, looking for the ways to get ahead”.Bess seemed to relish every second of his two Tests against Pakistan. Which speaks to the differences between this England dressing room and the one Lathwell walked into back in 1993, yes, but also the contrasting characters of the two men, one so introverted, the other so extroverted. Cricket is a sport for all sorts, but the bright lights, the big stage, of the Test game aren’t for everyone. And like Veness says, talent only takes a player so far. Everyone who saw Lathwell play was left with a lot of regrets. Bess, you guess, is not going to have so many of those, whatever happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/289b78ffca9bce9d2e596e0943f635893093b01e/0_23_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4108e3f9b442c31d4e75ed6eb6972fb6","title":"tour of britain 2018 route team time trial","story":"• Team time trial introduced for 2018• Two stages will finish on Whinlatter Pass in the Lake DistrictThe Tour of Britain will feature its first team time trial this year on a route designed to be unpredictable.After last year’s event was dominated by sprinters the 2018 race should be more punchy with two stages – including the team time trial – finishing on Whinlatter Pass in Cumbria and plenty of challenging climbs thrown in elsewhere.The race will start on Sunday 2 September with a 175km stage from Pembrey Country Park to Newport and visit the south-west, Warwickshire, Cumbria and Nottinghamshire before a return to the familiar circuit finish in London on 9 September.The team time trial will come on stage five, covering 14km from Cockermouth to Whinlatter Pass in the Lake District.A day later the riders will return to the summit but this time coming up the tougher eastern side at the end of a 169km stage which starts in Barrow-in-Furness.“Our partners at Cumbria County Council have helped us to achieve something that we have been keen to do for a number of years on stage five – a team time trial that finishes atop Whinlatter Pass,” said the race director, Mick Bennett.“This will be a test like no other, as teams will have to get their equipment choices and tactics spot on. The race may not be won here but some riders could certainly lose it.“In another first for the Tour of Britain we return to the same climb the following day for a double ascent of our summit finish, although riders will tackle it during a conventional road stage, albeit from its harder eastern side.”While Whinlatter Pass is likely to be the focus of the battle for the overall leader’s green jersey, there are testing climbs throughout the route, often in the final kilometres of the day.“This year we have worked hard to create an innovative and unpredictable route, with several surprises in store throughout the race,” Bennett added. “Several stages have stings in the tail climbs positioned towards the finale of stages one, two and three will keep the outcome up in the air until the very end.”Stage three will take the riders over a lumpy 125km circuit which starts and finishes in Bristol, with the 183km stage four from Nuneaton to Leamington Spa revisiting roads which will feature on this month’s Women’s Tour.After stages five and six in Cumbria, riders face their longest day in the saddle, a 223km stage from West Bridgford to Mansfield before the finale in London, which will cover 14 laps of a 5.5km circuit around the capital.With a series of sprint finishes keeping time differences at a minimum, the Dutchman Lars Boom won the 2017 Tour thanks to his victory on the stage five time trial, and his LottoNL-Jumbo squad are one of 10 WorldTour teams already confirmed to take part this year.Mark Cavendish’s Team Dimension Data, Team Sky and Mitchelton-Scott are also on the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06470cb6e97ebea2b767c0208e919b1bbbe230e/0_59_4571_2744/master/4571.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4ac617d75d7b82ab6095ffa3dcab308","title":"miss america swimsuit contest no longer judge appearances feminism","story":"The pageant is attempting a feminist makeover in the wake of #MeToo and will be scrapping the swimsuit contestMiss America, the annual televised pageant, has announced that it will be scrapping the swimsuit portion from this year’s event. Instead of rating contestants on how they look in a bikini, judges will now rank the women on “who you are as a person from the inside of your soul”.The 97-year-old competition is also discarding its evening gown section and asking contestants to wear clothes that make them feel confident. The chair of Miss America, Gretchen Carlson, a former pageant winner and Fox News anchor, ulged these changes on Tuesday. Speaking to Good Morning America, Carlson said: “We’ve heard from a lot of young women who say, ‘We’d love to be a part of your program but we don’t want to be out there in high heels and a swimsuit.’ So guess what, you don’t have to do that anymore.” On Tuesday morning, the official twitter account of Cara Mund, Miss America 2018, further underlined these changes by posting a video of a disappearing bikini. “We’re changing out of our swimsuits and into a whole new era #byebyebikini.”Carlson was appointed chair of Miss America earlier this year after former members of the top management resigned. Leaked emails had shown pageant officials disparaging past winners for their appearance, intellect and sex lives. Miss America now has an all-female leadership team.Discussing the new changes Miss America is instituting, Carlson acknowledged the organisation was responding to the #MeToo movement. “We’re experiencing a cultural revolution in our country with women finding the courage to stand up and have their voices heard on many issues,” she said. “Miss America is proud to evolve as an organization and join this empowerment movement.” No word yet on how a competition where women compete against each other for a sparkly crown plans to encourage empowerment.Carlson herself has been a prominent voice in the #MeToo movement. In July 2016, she sued former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment Ailes resigned shortly after.Miss America isn’t the only institution to have recently updated itself in the wake of #MeToo. In January, Formula One said it was ending the use of “grid girls”, the scantily-clad female models who are sprayed with champagne by winning drivers. “While the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula One grands prix for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern-day societal norms,” said Sean Bratches, Formula One’s managing director of commercial operations. The 2019 Miss America Competition airs live and without bikinis on ABC on 9 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d01a96048ff34d58383f6963e8f79124680664b9/0_0_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3025e1812d14b89522a50efef1f03d45","title":"putin pushes for end to harmful sanctions during austria visit","story":"Russian leader evaded MH17 questions during first visit to an EU country since re-electionVladimir Putin lobbied for the phasing out of economic sanctions and dodged questions about the shooting down of flight MH17 during his first state visit to an EU member state since being re-elected as Russian president in March.“Both those who initiate these actions and those such measures that we call sanctions are aimed against find them harmful,” Putin said in Vienna on Tuesday, claiming that European countries were merely “finding it hard to say so”.The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said diplomatic progress in eastern Ukraine, followed by a “gradual easing of sanctions”, imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, was “the scenario we are wishing for”.Notionally scheduled to commemorate 50 years since Austria became the first western European country to sign a natural gas deal with the Soviet Union, the visit also offered the Russian and Austrian leaders opportunities to advance their respective geopolitical agendas, with Kurz, 32, pushing his credentials as a bridge builder between east and west.The trip has come a month before Austria takes over the rotating EU presidency in July, and a week before Russian, Ukrainian, German and French foreign ministers are due to meet in Berlin on 11 June to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine.On the eve of the visit – during which the Russian president was protected by 800 soldiers, 800 police officers and 17 military vehicles – Putin had to face much tougher questions in an interview with the Austrian television journalist Armin Wolf, an encounter that turned out to be the toughest grilling the Russian president has faced for some years. Sit-down interviews with Putin are rare and usually conducted by loyal journalists. Wolf, however, repeatedly interrupted Putin when he gave evasive or misleading answers.In a particularly heated exchange on the annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of MH17 over eastern Ukraine, an irate Putin snapped: “If you do not like my answers, then do not ask me questions” and accused Wolf of engaging in “a monologue rather than an interview”.“The tragedy we are talking about is terrible, and I feel immensely sorry for the victims and their families, but this investigation must be objective and comprehensive,” he said.After pressing Putin on Ukraine, Syria, Russian meddling in Europe and why he had never uttered the name of Russia’s most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, who is currently in jail, Wolf used his final question to ask why there were so many Kremlin-approved photos of a half-naked Putin.“You said ‘half-naked’ not ‘naked,’ thank God. When I am on vacation I see no need to hide behind the bushes, and there is nothing wrong with that,” said Putin.During the visit, the Russian president was given an easy ride by figures from the more liberal end of the spectrum, such as the Austrian president, Alexander Van der Bellen, a former leader of the Green party.Asked during a joint press conference whether Austria’s dependence on Russian gas made the country prone to economic blackmail, Van der Bellen said American liquefied gas was two or three times more expensive than Russian gas.“Under these circumstances it makes little sense, purely economically, to replace Russian gas with American liquefied gas,” he said. The Austrian president also rejected one interviewer’s suggestion that Russia had a “credibility problem” in its current conflict with the EU.Over the weekend, the Austrian vice-chancellor, Heinz-Christian Strache, called for an immediate end to “exasperating sanctions” against Russia. His Freedom party signed a five-year “cooperation pact” with Putin’s United Russia party in 2016.

Damian Le Bas turns the key again. And again. After the eighth attempt, the engine rattles into life. “Thank fuck,” he exhales.Le Bas, 33, a writer and film-maker, is unusually relieved because the van has been his companion for thousands of miles while exploring Britain’s “stopping places” – the sites where Travellers traditionally pulled over – and the journey has become the subject of his first book. But his relief may also be partly because the Transit is one emblem of modern male Traveller identity, and he is alive to accusations that he is somehow not a real Gypsy. It has been suggested that Le Bas, who went to boarding school and Oxford University, is merely a hipster with a van.“A publisher asked: ‘Aren’t you just some really middle-class guy who happens to have a Traveller background?” says Le Bas. “He was implying that because I’m educated, I’m inauthentic. That is not a fantastic thing to say – that you can be educated out of your ethnicity. You can’t be educated out of being a Jamaican.”Le Bas is wearily familiar with the casual racism towards the ethnic minority of Gypsies and Travellers. As the former editor of the Travellers’ Times, he devoted himself to defending the different Roma communities, particularly after news stories about Gypsy criminality or disputes when Travellers settled in villages. He found this “exhausting and demoralising”, and wanted to explore both his own roots and the history of Gypsies in Britain, so his road trip began.Life on the road was a novel experience for Le Bas because, like many contemporary Travellers, he grew up “settled”, just outside Hove. “It was a typical Travellers’ yard in that there was an antagonistic relationship with the local authority. They had distributed flyers prior to my family moving up there saying: ‘Stop the Gypsies moving in.’” Le Bas spent his early childhood in houses, mobile homes and caravans (“trailers”) with his extended family, including his mother and father, who were both artists, and his nan – great-grandmother Julie Jones, who is 91. We meet at her house in Worthing, and she listens with interest as we talk in her front room.When Le Bas was 11, he won a life-changing scholarship to Christ’s Hospital, a boarding school in West Sussex. “My grandfather was very against the idea of me going to this weird school where who knew what I’d be exposed to. When I was homesick, my dad just wanted to pull me out. My mum stuck to her guns. It was very hard and upsetting for her but she thought if I went to a local school I might end up in trouble.” What did his nan think? “I cried when he went but it was a good thing,” says Jones. Was his family worried Le Bas would abandon Gypsy traditions? “No,” she says. “I thought of him being safe there and doing good for himself.”Le Bas didn’t feel safe enough at boarding school to reveal his background to any pupils except for two of his closest friends. “And also I wasn’t sure what it was. A lot of my family are true Romany Gypsies but I didn’t know where I fitted in to all that. I felt like I belonged to something but Travellers aren’t always so sure.” Although Le Bas speaks Romany, there were non-Gypsy relatives on both sides of his family tree. “A lot of Travellers draw a hard line between Gypsies and gorjies, non-Travellers, and I’ve got both in me.”Le Bas went on to Oxford, where he studied Hebrew and Greek as part of his theology degree. How many Gypsy students did he know? “I’ve never met another Traveller who has been to Oxbridge,” he says. Even though Le Bas was an exception at university, he grew more confident about his identity and challenged his peers’ racism. His education made him an exception among Travellers, too: he didn’t marry until he was 26 (his wife is the actor Candis Nergaard), unlike his mum who was married at 19, and he acquired an unplaceable accent, not at all plummy but with a Kentish inflection that sounds older than his years.It would be easy for The Stopping Places to be an angry rant, but Le Bas consciously “killed my old journalistic self” and tried to “eschew romanticism and angry activism” to write an elegiac contemporary travelogue. The book is also distinctive for being arguably the first literary exploration of Anglo-Romany culture by a Traveller. Serious studies of Gypsy culture are mostly the preserve of non-Gypsy academics (with a couple of exceptions in the United States). “It has been a monopoly of non-Gypsies for ever, to be honest,” says Le Bas. The book was also a more personal challenge: “I wanted to test the idea of being ‘a lesser son of greater sires’, a phrase from Tolkien,” he says. “It’s not easy growing up with stories of Nan’s father, who could weave a basket from reeds that could hold water. And master horses and heal people with herbalism. That’s how skilled he was. What can I do? I spent my childhood playing a Game Boy and riding a BMX.”But Le Bas soon becomes more comfortable in his own skin, and on the road. It changes his perception of time, he’s more aware of nature (“I’m not saying I’m some kind of horse whisperer but I’d be a little bit more attuned to what animals were doing”) and realises the starkness of the distinction between summer and winter. “Summer is really nice and winter is really horrible,” he says. Mud besmirches his van’s tiny, neat living space. “You’re hemmed in by rain for days. And if you’ve got washing to dry, it’s hard. Don’t ask me – Nan lived it.”During his travels, he developed a conviction that we should recognise a Romany geography. One stopping place, Messenger’s Meadow, had a sign instructing people not to disturb the soil because of Roman remains. “If there are Roman remains in the soil and we shouldn’t disturb them, we might want to think about the Gypsy remains at old stopping places. Roadside burials used to be common when people couldn’t afford a formal internment.” Not only are historic stopping places unheralded, but they are often barred by bollards or bunds of earth to stop their use today. Le Bas only knows one common in southern England on to which Gypsies can still freely drive. Nearly a decade ago, there were a series of conflicts when Travellers bought land and “settled” in rural villages. “People always point out: ‘They are Travellers, they should travel,’” he says. “It’s not the travel that’s the problem, it’s the stopping.”Is intolerance towards Travellers growing? “It has been pretty bad in the past,” he says. “At the minute, they are not hanging Gypsies for being Gypsies in England.” Le Bas writes about the case of Francis Buckley, a 16-year-old Gypsy boy from Islington who was arrested, tried and hanged, bizarrely, for impersonating a Gypsy – “counterfeiting himself to be an Egyptian”. Romany people, Le Bas argues, are “permanently trapped” in “the pincer of demonisation and romanticisation”. He dates the rise of anti-Gypsy prejudice to the birth of the nation state. “The nomad presented a problem to the nation state in terms of collecting taxes, because they had no fixed address. But there is also fear of a group that is perceived to be clannish and apart in some way. Many of these prejudices are very similar to antisemitic prejudices, and they are not really about nomadism. They are about a group that exists simultaneously within and outside European society. You can’t disregard pure racism as being a factor.”Now the internet amplifies hate, says Le Bas, and the mainstream media doesn’t help. At the Travellers’ Times he tackled the fallout from the Channel 4 series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. “It did an awful lot of damage, not just to Travellers, but to people who made the programme and the people who consumed it.” He’s still enraged by its “colonial tone” and the myths it propagated, such as that there is a tradition of “grabbing” young women. “That was some teenagers in a car park outside Staines bragging about their exploits and they inferred that this was a cultural practice with deep roots, which is absolute rubbish.”For all his determination to challenge prejudice, Le Bas does not seek to “represent” his people. “In so many ways I’m the least representative person you can think of,” he says. Besides, Travellers do not want to be represented. “There is no Board of British Romanies, nor is there likely to be. But I felt I had a responsibility as a thinking citizen as much as a Traveller to challenge this deeply unsatisfactory media narrative, which lacks nuance and colour. It’s just so boring and repetitive and unfair.” That narrative focuses on criminal or antisocial behaviour. “Journalists can’t report on an absence of criminality, on an absence of rubbish, because there’s nothing to report on, and so those who behave badly monopolise the coverage,” says Le Bas.In the future, Le Bas hopes he might articulate his culture through fiction but he also wants to defend the Romany language, which still has no official recognition in British law. “I worry that kids aren’t learning the language to the same level,” he says. “A view of the world can live within a language and be lost with it.”And what does Nan think? “It’s good,” says Jones. “I tell him, if he wants to do it, get on with it. You can’t live your life for other people. You’ve got to do what you want to do, what you think is right.”Le Bas smiles. “You see, Nan just sums it up better.”The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas is published on 7 June by Chatto \u0026amp Windus, priced £14.99.

And they do.People from as far away as Afghanistan, Israel, Russia, Hungary, Taiwan and Puerto Rico log on to Watson’s station Sleep Radio. Someone in Prague has been listening for three days straight.The idea of a radio station that sends listeners to sleep came to Watson after he had a heart attack 10 years ago. Following five coronary artery bypasses he began to suffer from chronic depression and insomnia.“I never used to have trouble going to sleep but now I was lying awake watching the sun rise and feeling like a zombie,” he said.Watson, 62, was treated with medication and started seeing a counsellor who suggested he try relaxing, ambient music to help him sleep. Soon he found there was not a lot out there for sleep music aficionados.“Even on the radio you would be listening to relaxing music, trying to get to sleep and, all of a sudden, an advert would come on, yelling at you to buy something.”Watson thought he could do better. He did his research, looking into royalty-free ambient music and taught himself how to set up a digital radio station. Sleep Radio was born.He said the project is a “hobby and a passion”. He often gets grateful listeners emailing him with their success stories, including a mother whose newborn baby is also seemingly a fan. However, Watson is quick to say that ambient music does not work for everyone. His wife, for example, finds it too boring. Sleep Radio has now expanded into an app that allows people to set a timer for their listening. Meanwhile Watson has not had to source new music for over a year. There are ambient music producers lining up to have people fall asleep to their material. However there are rules – no vocals, no piano, guitar or harp solos, and absolutely no ocean sounds or birdsong.“I’m amazed at how many artists happily contribute,” says Watson. “The ambient music genre isn’t that popular so any airplay they can get is good for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec60c0d285c71eeead38e43f1d8f79e8d6bc330/0_243_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cabe330bb9b891a105cd989e56cbf2a","title":"investing in our future why were opening lifetime isas","story":"Retirement reserves for a self-employed director, and an aspiring writer’s first house fund: how two very different young professionals are saving for their financial futuresOliver Sin, 29, is a freelance director, animator and illustrator who lives in Cheltenham. He has no retirement fund in place and would use the Lifetime Isa to save for the long-term futureUnfortunately, the nature of being self-employed means there’s no regularity in how often I’m paid. Projects can be sporadic and uncertain. Invoices can be delayed, projects can drag on or I can just not win work for a while. If I don’t work, I don’t make money. It’s a scary and risky career but it’s very rewarding at times.I pay myself a set salary that helps me limit how much I spend each month, and keeps the money I shouldn’t spend in my business. I also put some of this salary into my savings. Anything extra I earn at the end of the year usually goes into my savings too. It’s definitely stressful though. I sometimes worry if I’ll carry on making enough money as each year passes, but if I can stay organised with my business and earnings, I can relax a lot more.As well as having an unreliable income, it’s also challenging having to calculate how much I’ll spend in expenses for my business and how much tax I’ll owe each year. There are days I wish I was employed again, so I could rely on a steady stream of income and know how much I can actually put into my savings each month. However, the upside of being freelance is that I can earn a higher amount each month than I normally would when working for a company, which makes the opportunity to save far greater.The main attraction of a Lifetime Isa for me is the prospect of having a retirement fund for when I’m older. Being self-employed, I don’t currently have a pension and it’s scary knowing I have nothing to fall back on. I’m hitting 30 this year and having a Lifetime Isa or a pension is a must for me now. I’m always one to want to find the best option possible and other Isas currently on the market don’t feel worthwhile any more.There’s nothing worse than constantly saving and never enjoying your money. My wife and I are hooked on travel and like to see as much of the world as possible. Aside from wanting to build a financial safety net for the future, our main saving goal is to have enough to enjoy ourselves along the way.Laura Lucas, 29, is a marketing assistant in Manchester and a lifestyle blogger in her spare time. She is considering a Lifetime Isa to save for her first houseI blog most evenings, which doesn’t provide much income, but I hope it’ll be my main job one day. Blogging is good in that I can save money that I might have otherwise spent on dinner out or a new outfit, because I’m lucky enough to get gifted these sorts of things. I feel like I’m currently working two jobs, one that I love but which doesn’t pay, and my main job that I rely on for income. My partner and I got engaged over Christmas, so we’re saving for a wedding in about two years’ time, as well as starting to think about buying our first home together. We’ll probably do the wedding on a budget with some special bits and bobs thrown in, but we’ll have to plan ahead to make sure we can afford the extravagant extras. I’d also love to have an engagement party in the next few months and it’s my partner’s 30th birthday this year, so even though we want to celebrate these occasions in style we might have to dial them down a little to save money. We both work really hard, so we don’t want to cut out anything like holidays or evening drinks with friends. I like to think I’m a good saver, and a Lifetime Isa would help us to save for our first house. It’s great to have something backed by the government to help young people save. It’s challenging these days but a Lifetime Isa encourages you to think long term about home ownership and retirement. I already have a couple of savings accounts that I sometimes dip into for Christmas and birthdays, holidays and more expensive purchases, but setting these accounts up can be stressful. It takes a lot of research and background work to fully understand what you’re getting when you sign up.At the moment, I’m not quite sure where I want to be money-wise. I’m grateful for my living situation and being able to live comfortably. However, there are many more things we’d love to do, like decorating our apartment and travelling more, but with our wedding and buying a house on the horizon, we’re trying to be a bit more sensible and only invest small amounts at a time in things we know we need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5aa7c8a80034b712f3fe779d128833acb137a7/0_516_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a0256549ad0f979f025f93b1e6c682","title":"how to buy your first house","story":"Many of us aim to own our own home. But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3961ff6bd45223a626b86d067c99a9fadb159cb3/0_137_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5faf953013180a1480cefeec5f7824d9","title":"eight financial apps to transform how you deal with money","story":"It’s time to upgrade your piggy bank.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

I had more pressing issues to worry about, such as the characters on my lunch box or the contents of my pencil case.We were told things such as “Life is not a sprint, it’s a marathon”, and so the distance to the horizon appeared endless.What I didn’t know at the time was that some great power had set my journey’s compass firmly to June 2018 and the big one: the Leaving Cert.Just like Kathy in Kazuo Ishiguro’s tale of lost innocence, Never Let Me Go, I’ve known for a while that my days were numbered this trip, which started off softly, has an expiry date on it.My supports, my frustrating allies, like my teachers, family and friends, will walk me to those State exam papers, but in there I will be alone (albeit without farming out my limbs, as poor Kathy had to endure.)Everything I have learned must be squeezed into a series of a few quiet hours cooped up in an exam hall.So, the marathon is finally over and now it is time to sprint with every parcel of energy I can muster. In the flurry of that final sprint, will I offload surplus baggage?But what if Frost appears instead of Hopkins?Will my mind race to Miss McSweeney’s English class on a warm sunny day in April?Will I hear her chirpy voice and remember everything she said, as I scan over the pink paper that was just dropped on to my desk as the starting pistol blasts me into the Leaving Cert? What if that gunshot paralyses me and my mind goes blank?Maybe on the last night before history, study will shove something else from my head, and I will be bereft because the moon landing appears on my history paper instead of the fallout from the Vietnam War that’ll be foremost in my mind? I can’t put up my hand and ask a question like I did in Mr Keane’s class!So, is that it?Will my future be decided by some clandestine examining authority locked up in an obscure government building, choosing which section of my education is relevant for the rest of my life?If I get it wrong, will those severed top rungs of the academic performance ladder, the Leaving Cert, put my third-level choices out of my reach? It’s possible – and I will deal with that in August.Although the exams place a large shadow of self-doubt and worry across these early summer days, it would be a big mistake to think the results of these 14 years of education can be squashed into a month of trials.After it’s all over I’ll join forces with my fellow Leaving Cert survivors in west Clare for a week of beach time and trad music sessions like we played in Ms Fahy’s music class.There are also the friendships that moved to other schools but still burn bright that I will nurture, or those that faded but will still hold a place in my heart.These will be as much a part of me as my performance in the exam hall, like Ms Condron who taught me the subtleties of French – or 4D (Mr Forde), who taught us that there’s humour even in darkest corners of trigonometry.They’ll walk with me long after I last struggle to remember the piano overture I played for my music practical.The truth is I’ll never be 100 per cent ready for the Leaving Cert.But, armed with sharpened stationery and a solid grounding, I have learned how to deal with anything it might throw at me."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3520343.1528218667!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reforms needed to tackle leaving cert anxiety say principals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResearch indicates there are rising levels of anxiety among schoolchildren which experts say may be linked to factors such as social media and a growing culture of expectation around students.School principals say Leaving Certificate reforms are urgently needed to ease some of the anxiety it is causing among students.The warning comes as almost 121,000 students prepare to begin their Junior and Leaving Cert exams on Wednesday.The National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals said pressure caused by the high-stakes, terminal exam was causing some students to spend much of their time at second level in “perpetual anxiety”.The association’s director Clive Byrne said: “There’s a reason grown adults still have dreams – or nightmares – about re-sitting their Leaving Cert.“Revising for exams is gruelling at the best of times, but when you’re repeatedly told that a fortnight in June will determine the rest of your life, it’s no wonder young people spend much of their school life in perpetual anxiety.”Research indicates there are rising levels of anxiety among schoolchildren which experts say may be linked to factors such as social media and a growing culture of expectation around students.Some clinical experts say pressure around the Leaving Cert, in particular, is contributing to anxiety among students.Mr Byrne also said the system was not serving students well in preparing for college or the world of work.It relied too heavily on rote learning which meant students were neglecting key skills such as critical thinking, he said.“College lecturers continuously complain that Irish students lack the study and thinking skills required of them at third level, especially in scientific and mathematical subjects,” he said.“Further education asks a lot more of people than the Leaving Cert, like original thought, innovation, argumentation, and an ability to read between the lines and understand context.“Indeed, because of their deficits in these areas, many fresh-faced undergraduates who otherwise excelled within the boundaries of the secondary system receive a nasty shock when their first college assignments receive middling marks.”The Department of Education’s advisory body on the curriculum this year commenced a review of the Leaving Cert, though it is likely to take several years before there are significant changes.Students, meanwhile, have received best wishes messages from the Minister for Education Richard Bruton, principals and teachers’ unions in advance of the exams.Mr Bruton said students have put in huge effort to get to this point and should be very proud of their work to date.“Almost 58,000 students are sitting the Leaving Certificate examinations this year, including students taking the Leaving Certificate Applied and the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme,” he said.“I’d like to remind everyone that although these exams are important, they are just one pathway in education. There are now a range of opportunities available to you to fulfil your ambitions.”In addition to higher education and further education courses, he said there were a very broad range of apprenticeship and traineeship programmes available in new areas, such as ICT and financial services, as well as the traditional craft courses.“These are very attractive options that lead to very rewarding careers, when considering your next steps,” he said.He also said he was delighted that approaches to teaching and learning in the junior cycle are supporting students to engage in active learning and to develop the skills needed for the 21st century.He said progress is continuing to be made on the rollout of the new junior cycle subjects, with the introduction of five new subject specifications in the next academic year.“I’d like to pay tribute to all the teachers, principals and of course parents for their role in supporting their students in preparing for these exams,” he said.“We are very fortunate in Ireland to have such a dedicated and committed teaching profession. Teachers and school leaders have a transformative impact on a child’s life and make an invaluable contribution to our society.”The ASTI and TUI teachers’ unions also wished student well ahead of the exams."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3519938.1528180184!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels talks mark beginning of crucial fortnight on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Photograph: EPABALAZS MOHAIToday begins a critical fortnight in the Brexit negotiations, with Irish officials expecting to receive long-awaited British proposals on the Border in the coming days. Talks are scheduled between the British and EU sides every day this week.The Government wants to see significant progress at the technical talks this week in an effort to break the stalemate between the EU and UK over the future of the Border, and high-ranking sources confirmed that they expected to see proposals from the British this week.Dublin is pressing the British to provide more detailed alternative solutions and proposals on a legally-operable text on the default “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market and customs union should no other plan be agreed to maintain an invisible border. The timetable for the EU-UK talks in Brussels lists a session on Wednesday on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sources in Brussels say that it is expected to be a short meeting, dealing with a number of technical issues, although if the UK brings new proposals they will be discussed.Three more days of talks follow this week on the draft Withdrawal Agreement. The Government has cast the coming two weeks as crucial in the negotiations if a solution to the Border issue is to be approved by EU leaders at a European Council summit at the end of this month.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been increasing pressure on London to propose more concrete solutions in time for the summit. Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit negotiator, has warned of a difficult summer of negotiations if no progress is made by this summit, pushing negotiations to the October deadline set to allow the UK and EU parliaments time to approve any final withdrawal deal by the UK’s departure next March. “Our position remains that significantly more progress is needed ahead of the June European Council, ” said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs.“Michel Barnier has made this very clear, including during his recent visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland. At this stage in the process the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.”Concerns about the lack of progress in negotiations were voiced by Germany’s top Brexit diplomat Peter Ptassek, who played down expectations about agreement being reached by the council on June 28th-29th. Irish officials viewed Mr Ptassek’s remarks as another attempt to increase the pressure on the British to propose solutions in what is viewed as a make-or-break fortnight to prepare for the June summit as UK media reports suggest the British is preparing “Doomsday” contingency plans for no deal. An influential London think tank has said in a new report that British prime minister Theresa May should propose her own version of the backstop for the Border before the summit.“The UK has made it clear that the EU version of the backstop is unacceptable. But the government has not, so far, put forward draft language of its own,” says the Institute for Government report.“It needs to – and it needs to make clear that it is not trying to shirk the commitments it entered into in December. With no other workable proposition yet identified, let alone agreed, it needs to table something that could work, meets those commitments and is politically acceptable.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks. We’ll take it from here.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and

nearly popular among nursery age children teenagers","story":"YouTube was the most popular platform for children use to broadcast content, followed by Facebook Live and Instagram Live.  Live streaming is nearly as popular among nursery-age children as teenagers, figures show.Research by Internet Matters, which educates parents about their children\u0027s online behaviour, found that nearly as many children aged four to five are livestreaming their own content as those aged 14 to 16.Among the youngest children, 13 per cent are using livestreaming apps to film and post content online, while among teenagers the figure is 17 per cent. Overall almost one in three children aged between six and 10 post live content sometimes, the survey found. The research, which involved interviewing 2,000 parents, found that children were less likely to vlog or livestream as they reached their older teenage years as they became more image conscious and busy with other activities.YouTube was the most popular platform for children use to broadcast content, followed by Facebook Live and Instagram Live.Dr Linda Papadopoulos, a psychologist who works with Internet Matters, said: Live-streaming is another example of how kids have moved their lives online and are increasingly using digital platforms as a way of crowdsourcing their identity.Top tips | How to stay safe on social mediaInstead of

research published by children’s charity Barnardo’s showed that children are at risk of grooming on livestreaming sites.Barnardo’s chief executive Javed Khan said: Our research shows that children use

If Sky News is not spun off\u0026nbspthe takeover will be blocked, the culture secretary said.He told\u0026nbspthe House of Commons that the competition watchdog had found that the takeover could lead to an erosion of Sky News’ editorial independence and an increase in the control of the Murdoch family trust\u0026nbspover UK media. The Murdoch family also owns The Times and The Sun.The culture secretary said the sale of Sky News would be the most “proportionate and effective remedy” for those concerns.He will discuss further details of the spin-off and sale with the parties over the next 15 days – including assurances that Sky News will be supported financially for at least 10\u0026nbspyears – before reaching a final decision.\u0026nbspOn the separate issue of broadcasting standards, Mr Hancock said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had concluded the takeover was not contrary to the public interest.He also said he would not intervene in a rival bid for Sky from US media giant Comcast.Mr Murdoch is hoping to take control of the 61 per cent of Sky that he does not already own. His long-held ambition to take full control of the broadcaster has been repeatedly frustrated as regulators and politicians have voiced concerns over the potential damage a deal could do to UK media.Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox agreed an £11.5bn deal in December 2016 to take full control of Sky.That came five years after Mr Murdoch was forced to give up on his previous attempt to buy Sky as his empire became embroiled in the phone-hacking scandal.The proposed deal could not survive revelations that reporters had listened to the voicemails of hundreds of public figures, and that politicians had uncomfortably close relationships with Mr Murdoch and his senior executives.Last month\u0026nbspthe competition watchdog delivered its final report to the culture secretary on Mr Murdoch’s latest bid after preliminary findings in January that the takeover would not be in the public interest.\u0026nbspFox offered a number of concessions in an attempt to allay those concerns, including hiving\u0026nbspoff\u0026nbspSky News into a separate legal entity or selling the channel to Disney.The latter offer is complicated by the fact that Disney is currently mounting its own $66bn bid to buy Fox’s entertainment assets, including Sky.\u0026nbspMr Murdoch also faces a bidding war for Sky with Comcast – one of the world’s largest broadcasting companies – which announced a £22bn\u0026nbspoffer in April, prompting Sky to immediately withdraw its recommendation to shareholders to support Fox’s offer which values the target at £18.5bn.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, a vocal critic of the Murdochs, said on Tuesday: “With Comcast now in the ring\u0026nbspthe future for Sky is uncertain, a bidding war is on the horizon.“That might be good for shareholders but it’s the minister’s duty to protect the interest of the public.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But they are still allowed to attend meetings - just not when their pay is being discussed.It comes after the University and College Union (UCU) revealed that more than nine in 10 university vice-chancellors either sit on, or attend, the committee that sets their salaries.The union has\u0026nbspsaid that a “bizarre gentleman’s agreement” - where the vice-chancellor steps outside of a committee meeting while their pay is discussed - is not the way to tackle excessive pay.\u0026nbspVice-chancellors\u0027 pay has been in the spotlight in recent months - with growing concern over university leaders who take home hundreds of thousands of pounds having a say in their own salary.The new Higher Education Senior Staff Remuneration Code, which had been designed to create a more transparent and open system, says salaries must demonstrate “value for money”.Universities must calculate and publish the ratio of their\u0026nbspleaders\u0027 pay compared to the median earnings of their\u0026nbspworkforce. If this multiple is significantly above average they will have to explain why.This means, for example, that a university would need to state if the vice-chancellor is earning two, three or four times (or more) the typical salary at the university.Institutions which do not comply with the voluntary code will be required to “publicly explain” how alternative arrangements meet the principles of the guidance.The Office for Students, the new regulator for higher education, will look into whether an institution follows the code or not, when establishing whether it has a licence to operate.\u0026nbspIf the regulator deems that this is not the case, they can apply fines and other penalties.But Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, does not think the voluntary code will successfully tackle the high salaries, bonuses and expenses of university bosses.“This woefully inadequate code is nothing more than another plea for restraint to a group of people who have ignored every previous request,” she said.\u0026nbspThe UCU revealed in February that nearly half of vice-chancellors are members of their university\u0027s remuneration bodies, while others are able to attend meetings.Ms Hunt added: “A bizarre gentleman’s agreement where the boss steps outside while their pay is discussed is not how you tackle excessive pay.“The embarrassing comparisons some vice-chancellors have made between themselves and bankers and footballers, or the pride they have taken in their Bentleys and yachts, has demonstrated how out of touch they are.”\u0026nbspInstead, the UCU has called for staff and students to have a place on remuneration committees to ensure that university bosses are held to account.\u0026nbspChris Sayers, chair of the CUC, said: “Vice-chancellors lead some of the most complex organisations in the UK. Their leadership has helped the UK higher education system become one of the best in the world in terms of teaching and research.\u0026nbsp“To sustain these world-class\u0026nbsporganisations, it is vital that institutions recruit, retain and reward those people that are responsible for that success.\u0026nbsp“However, it is equally important that universities balance the need for recruiting the best talent with the need to demonstrate value for money and that is why we have published this guidance.\u0026nbsp“We are confident the new code will promote more transparency and improve the public’s understanding of and confidence in the way decisions around pay are made.”Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, said: “Universities receive significant amounts of public funding, so it is only right that their senior staff pay arrangements command public confidence and deliver value for money for both students and taxpayers.“I welcome the publication of the CUC Higher Education Senior Staff Remuneration Code as an important step in ensuring that senior staff pay in Higher Education is fair, justifiable and transparent.\u0026nbsp“I am pleased the new code includes a ban on vice-chancellors sitting on the committees that set their pay.\u0026nbsp“We have also taken concrete action to address excess pay, giving the Office for Students powers to tackle this issue if universities do not take action.”The basic salary of vice-chancellors increased by 2.3 per cent in the 12 months up to January, bringing the average basic salary of university bosses to £255,502, latest CUC figures show.Professor Dame Glynis Breakwell, who\u0026nbspis stepping down from the University of Bath\u0027s top job\u0026nbspin August, has a\u0026nbspsalary and benefits that total\u0026nbspmore than £468,000.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If Sky News is not spun off\u0026nbspthe takeover will be blocked, the culture secretary said.He told\u0026nbspthe House of Commons that the competition watchdog had found that the takeover could lead to an erosion of Sky News’ editorial independence and an increase in the control of the Murdoch family trust\u0026nbspover UK media. The Murdoch family also owns The Times and The Sun.The culture secretary said the sale of Sky News would be the most “proportionate and effective remedy” for those concerns.He will discuss further details of the spin-off and sale with the parties over the next 15 days – including assurances that Sky News will be supported financially for at least 10\u0026nbspyears – before reaching a final decision.\u0026nbspOn the separate issue of broadcasting standards, Mr Hancock said the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had concluded the takeover was not contrary to the public interest.He also said he would not intervene in a rival bid for Sky from US media giant Comcast.Mr Murdoch is hoping to take control of the 61 per cent of Sky that he does not already own. His long-held ambition to take full control of the broadcaster has been repeatedly frustrated as regulators and politicians have voiced concerns over the potential damage a deal could do to UK media.Mr Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox agreed an £11.5bn deal in December 2016 to take full control of Sky.That came five years after Mr Murdoch was forced to give up on his previous attempt to buy Sky as his empire became embroiled in the phone-hacking scandal.The proposed deal could not survive revelations that reporters had listened to the voicemails of hundreds of public figures, and that politicians had uncomfortably close relationships with Mr Murdoch and his senior executives.Last month\u0026nbspthe competition watchdog delivered its final report to the culture secretary on Mr Murdoch’s latest bid after preliminary findings in January that the takeover would not be in the public interest.\u0026nbspFox offered a number of concessions in an attempt to allay those concerns, including hiving\u0026nbspoff\u0026nbspSky News into a separate legal entity or selling the channel to Disney.The latter offer is complicated by the fact that Disney is currently mounting its own $66bn bid to buy Fox’s entertainment assets, including Sky.\u0026nbspMr Murdoch also faces a bidding war for Sky with Comcast – one of the world’s largest broadcasting companies – which announced a £22bn\u0026nbspoffer in April, prompting Sky to immediately withdraw its recommendation to shareholders to support Fox’s offer which values the target at £18.5bn.Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, a vocal critic of the Murdochs, said on Tuesday: “With Comcast now in the ring\u0026nbspthe future for Sky is uncertain, a bidding war is on the horizon.“That might be good for shareholders but it’s the minister’s duty to protect the interest of the public.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There are believed to be enough Conservative rebel MPs for the motion to pass if Labour also supported it.However, the shadow cabinet decided on Tuesday that Labour MPs would be whipped to abstain on the motion.Instead, they will be ordered to back Labour’s amendment, which a source said would result in an “EEA style” arrangement in which Britain retains the benefits of the single market without remaining a full member. \u0026nbspThe source said the move was designed to be a compromise that Labour MPs could unite behind, after it became “abundantly clear” that MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies would not vote in favour remaining in the EEA.But in a sign of ongoing isions in the party, prominent backbenchers said the move was “nowhere near enough” and vowed to defy the party whip in order to vote to keep Britain in the EEA.One source said around 65 Labour MPs are believed to be willing to vote against the party leadership on the issue.Chuka Umunna, one of the most vocal anti-Brexit voices in the Commons, said: “The only way of realising the objectives set out in the amendment, short of EU membership, is through the UK being part of the European Economic Area, as a minimum.“Like the Tory government and hard Brexiteers, this amendment seeks \u0027access\u0027 to the EU\u0027s single market, but this is nowhere near enough. What the overwhelming majority of Labour members and supporters want is so much more - to be part of the framework of protections for workers, consumers and the environment which being part of the European Economic Area uniquely offers to non-EU members.“All the way through the passage of this Bill, the only amendments which have commanded support on both sides of the House and passed are cross party backbench ones.\u0026nbsp So, if we are serious about ‘protecting full access to the internal market of the EU’ and ensuring ‘no new impediments to trade’, logic dictates Labour MPs should be whipped to support the cross-party EEA amendment sent to us by the House of Lords.”Another pro-EU Labour MP, Chris Leslie, said Conservative MPs were ready to join forces with Labour but would not support a motion tabled by Mr Corbyn or the Opposition front bench.He told The Independent: “The Lords have sent down a golden opportunity for the Commons to actually change the government’s negotiating objectives, and to miss that historic opportunity would be utterly unforgivable and cause widespread dismay across the Labour movement.“I’m quite worried that in pursuit of a policy of constructive ambiguity, we’re throwing away this once-in-a-generation opportunity to put the best interests of the country first.“There is a strong likelihood that Jeremy Corbyn’s legacy will be to have facilitated Brexit and dropped the ball on this golden chance to keep the country in the single market, and I find that staggering.”Describing the Labour frontbench motion as a “fig leaf” designed to convince MPs not to back the EEA amendment, he added: “I’m frustrated and depressed in equal measure.“It feels like Labour is playing parliamentary games rather than grasping this once-in-a-generation opportunity.”Another Labour rebel told The Independent: They have been calling people and saying, don\u0027t vote for the Lords amendment, you can vote for our own one instead.But what they have put down doesn\u0027t mean anything. They must think we were born yesterday.The creative ambiguity they keep going back to works up to a certain point, but in the end they are going to have say what they want, they are not there yet.The 15 amendments made to the flagship EU Withdrawal Bill by the House of Lords will be considered by the Commons next Tuesday, with ministers’ hopes of overturning them all likely to be strongly challenged by Conservative rebels.Announcing Labour’s new motion, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.Existing single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries. We need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.He added: “Two years on from the referendum it is clear that the Government has no plan for how it will protect jobs and the economy, and guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.“Labour’s amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market. Parliament should have the opportunity to debate and vote on it.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My name is Sajid Javid, I’m the home secretary,” he said.\u0026nbspIn an attempt to bat away the issue, Mr Javid also attacked the MCB, which was the first group to write to the party calling for an inquiry, claiming they had associations with extremism and did not represent British Muslims.But Mr Amin said the same argument could not possibly be used against the Conservative Muslim Forum.He went on: “The CMF has members who are as integrated as you can get. We are lawyers, accountants, bankers and doctors.“We cannot be disparaged as closet extremists – if we are concerned then it is a serious problem.”In recent days a number of current and former Tory members have also contacted The Independent about their personal experiences of Islamophobia and racism in the party.A current activist in London, who has been a member for four years, said he has experienced discrimination throughout that time.In one example who said that a dinner hosted by his local Conservative association, five BME attendees were placed on one table at the far end of the room.When a complaint was raised the deputy leader of the group replied “he could not be racist because his girlfriend is black”.A former Tory activist from Ealing said he experienced harassment because of his faith which ultimately led him to leave the party.When he applied to be a councillor he was asked to attend a selection interview and, upon hearing that he had volunteered at a Muslim-led community organisation, one of the interviewers asked “if there was something he was not telling them”.Another interviewer quizzed the activist on his position on women participating in politics and being members of the workforce.“Naturally in your core belief women are not allowed to work – what is your opinion on that?” the activist said he was asked.He said he could not believe the line of questioning and after the interview no longer had a desire to represent the party.In another shocking anecdote, he said a councillor regularly “swore at him” and told him he was “not welcome” in the Conservatives.\u0026nbsp“I just remember feeling terrible when I walked out of there. It just was not a pleasant experience,” the activist told The Independent.“I’ve been bullied and harassed and I am mentally tired from this.”There have also been a number of incidents of Islamophobic and racist content posted on social media by councillors and party members, with 12 reports in the past two months.Stephen Ardley, a councillor on the Waveney District Council, was suspended after The Independent revealed he allegedly said it was “unbelievable” that a Muslim had been elected mayor of London and went on to describe those who voted for him as “blind”.\u0026nbsp“I think it’s unbelievable that a Muslim was actually elected the mayor of this great Christian country – oh wait, he’s Labour so the blind just vote red and left,” he apparently posted on Facebook.Councillor Ian Hibberd from Southampton was also suspended after he commented on a picture posted on social media uploaded by fellow Tory councillor Harmeet Singh Brar asking: “Why are you dressed like a p***?”Mr Brar, who is not Muslim, has now left the Conservative Party altogether saying it was due to “two years of bullying, harassment and racism”.He said the party’s decision to “investigate” the matter was a “get out”.“I felt when I spoke out about racism I was isolated and casted out. That was the major reason why I left” he told The Independent.\u0026nbspIn response to calls for an inquiry, a Conservative Party spokesperson said: “We have introduced a new code of conduct covering all forms of discrimination and we take all allegations seriously.“The party has acted quickly when presented with evidence of inappropriate behaviour, suspending those involved and launching immediate investigations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Can’t use an airport coz they will nick you.In it he said: Better luck trying to catch me when I go out of the country next time, Merseyside Police.Walker is in fact wanted by Cheshire Police.Cops say that the self-proclaimed hardman was only wanted by cops for failing to appear at Chester Magistrates Court on April 20 in relation to a disqualified driving offence, and driving without insurance.Its not thought that exit checks would actively be in place preventing someone from leaving the country with an outstanding warrant for such a minor offence.Border Force officials would be responsible for this upon reentry to the UK.In April Walker posted: I hear I’m now wanted by police trying to frame me an jail me for banned driving.My ban was up last month.This is an attempt to sabotage my container goin to the slums of Africa! I chose not to go court an to go Africa instead.These people are more important than a court date!A police spokeswoman said: We are aware of the social media post and are reviewing it.Walker is active on social media and was recently mocked after filming himself freeing cows from a farm that he claimed were set to be slaughtered, only for farmers to point out that they were dairy cows.He has also once threatened to end the career of Chelsea ace Ross Barkley.The sinister Twitter message, sparked in a row over an ex-girlfriend of the footballer, said: “Inbox me a number for you, ya little rat!“You know wot this is about so don’t play stupid or your footie career will come to an end!”Speaking from Sierra Leone, Walker said: “I was in a Catch-22. I had to fulfil my promise to the people in the slums, knowing full well that when am caught I will get the maximum sentence of four months in jail plus two months for missing my court date.“But to me the people were more important. The court date could wait.Sometimes in life you have to do the wrong thing in the eyes of the law in order to do the right thing.”He now claims to have spent thousands on installing fresh water pipes for the slums after seeing “men, women and children dying”.Walker said: “I managed to convince them to start fitting a fresh water line for them and I paid for it there and then to make sure it was 100% being done.They have installed a 5,000 litre water tank in the slums so no woman or child has to ever drink dirty water again.”Yet Walker, who has been in and out of prison since a teenager, denies he is a changed person.He admitted: “I have not just woke up and changed overnight. I am still the same person and still do what I do.“But that does not mean I can’t help the people who need it and give them a voice.“I know when I come back to the UK I will be arrested at the airport and put straight in jail.“I can deal with that knowing that I have fulfilled my promise to the people in the slums by giving them a container full of toys, clothes and food and given them fresh clean water so no man, woman or child ever has to risk their lives by drinking dirty sewage water again.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411125060.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vladimir putin russia austria eu visit divide conquer europe interview","story":"The Russian leader claimed he wanted the organisation to “be united and flourish” because it is the countrys “most important business partner”.Putin told Austrian broadcaster ORF yesterday: We do not pursue the objective of dividing anything or anyone in the EU.We are far more interested in the EU being united and flourishing because the EU is our most important trading and economic partner.Moscows ties the EU remain strained after following the annexation of Crimea, Russia’s continued involvement in Syria and the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.Austrias government was in a minority of EU countries that did not kick out any Russian diplomats over the nerve agent attack against Skripal and his daughter Yulia.Despite its membership of the EU, Vienna prides itself on a history of neutrality and its relatively warm relations with Moscow.Austria is due to take over the rotating EU presidency in July and has already indicated it wants to act as a bridge between east and west.Putin’s trip also officially marks 50 years since the two countries energy firms Gazprom and OMV first signed a gas supply deal.The leader of the nationalist Freedom Party, Heinz-Christian Strache, which has close links with Putins All-Russia Peoples Front called this weekend for sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia to be lifted.But Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his conservatives, who control Austrias EU policy, have said Austria will toe the EU line.We decide pragmatically whether to cooperate with someone politically, Putin said when asked in the interview about United Russias ties with far-right parties.We try to work with those who publicly express the wish themselves to work with us, he added.Putin is expected to meet with liberal President Van der Bellen, Chancellor Kurz and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, whose Freedom Party entered the government in December as the junior coalition partner."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411074104.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hand of god reaches down from the sky in amazing cloud formation captured on an iphone","story":"Louise Taylor, 30, took the spectacular photos on her iPhone after spotting the bizarre formation while out in the Highlands of Scotland.Louise, from Kinlochewe in the north west Highands, was in near Tore as she travelled to Dingwall in 2016 when she saw the remarkable sight and instantly whipped out her mobile phone.She said: The photos were taken on an iPhone while travelling.

It is not possible. We do not know yet what needs to be there.”And Port of Calais chief Benoit Rochet added: The most important problem is we know that there is Brexit but we dont exactly know what Brexit means.Tory MP Nicky Morgan, who was chairing the Treasury Select Committee evidence session, quipped back: You’re not alone.Asked if his port would be ready by 2021, Mr Rochet said there was no choice but to ensure it would be.But he warned: The clock is running, time is running. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which runs the Channel Tunnel, heaped pressure on Mrs May’s Brexit dithering, saying he was waiting for clarity from the Government.In order to make our contingency planning we need to have a direction to go in, he said.Mr Keefe said his organisation had very clear guidance on what would happen in a no deal scenario.We are preparing for that as much as we can, he added.But he pleaded with Government for more detail on what the UK’s long term trading relationship with the EU will look like, adding: Once we have that specification as an industry we are very flexible.He added that the port chiefs could make Brexit work once they know what they are dealing with: The important part is the specification.Once we have that detail we can build something, but we are in a bit of a vacuum at the moment.And he insisted that around the world there is a lot of very good smart border technology” that could be copied for the UK and EU.“There are elements of that technology that could be used in a smart border environment anywhere.

It was like disorganised chaos and I was scared.”The tribunal panel will now decide whether or not Laxman should be served with a formal warning."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411166735.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"these incredible photographs looked like theyre photoshopped but theyre totally genuine","story":"However despite the optical illusions and bizarre elements, they are all totally genuine.In a strange snap a boat looks like it is floating in mid air metres above inviting blue water.And in another mind-blowing image a huge pink wave threatens to take out a vessel off the coast of Australia.A teenager manages to walk on water in one shot, while a boat appears to emerge out of a cloud in the San Fransisco sky in another.All of the pictures look like they have been photoshopped, but they havent been doctored at all..."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408822955.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour refuses to refund supporters who bought 35 tickets to jezfest music event before the party started giving them away free","story":"Only a few thousand tickets have been sold to the hard left leader’s ‘Labour Live’ music festival day on June 16.The north London venue has a capacity of 20,000, running the risk of it looking like a major snub for Mr Corbyn.To save his blushes, dozens of constituency Labour parties across the country are being sent 30 free tickets each.And coaches are also being laid on to transport activists on the day also without any charge.But the giveaway sparked a backlash among other party supporters, who demanded a refund having shelled out £35.Labour last night refused to reveal how many tickets they had sold at full price.  A Labour Party spokesperson said: “A small number of tickets have been donated to some CLPs.“We look forward to hosting Labour LIVE which will be a fun day out for all our supporters and members of the local community.”It also emerged two weeks ago that the Unite trade union has also bought up 1,000 tickets to give away to its members."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411201678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"world map literal translations country names","story":"But they are infact the literal meaning of Spain and Cameroon, as revealed by fascinating maps offering an insight into the original names of countries.While some are fairly obvious, such as Englands -

as the worlds largest river weaves through a number of countries.Guyana means Land of Many Waters in an indigenous Amerindian language, and Venezuela is named Little Venice, after the Italian city of canals.Oceania is made up of many islands, and as such many of their literal names include the word island.Australia is dubbed Southern Land and New Zealand the Land of the Long White Cloud, which Nauru is rather invitingly called I Got To The Beach."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411079765.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family hartlepool can house fosters cans evicted","story":"Philip Muspratt began decorating the Hartlepool house in a unique fashion in 2005 but were asked to leave amid a housing developmentIt divided opinion as the semi-detached home was gradually covered in the blue and silver cans.But now, after his death in 2015, the Muspratts were ordered to move out of the eye-catching property.It is in the middle of a council estate and is being knocked down so new houses can be built.The family was said to have refused the councils offers to leave the home but appear to have now left.The house is now boarded up and fencing surrounds the property -

Dagenham legend Eileen Pullen, 88, is delighted that her great-granddaughter’s generation are prepared to continue her fight for equality. “I’m all for it,” she says. “Things are a lot worse than I thought, women have a big fight in front of them. You can’t be frightened. “If you think you’re entitled to more pay, go for it.”  Eileen was one of the leaders when 185 female machinists at Dagenham, East London, went on strike in 1968 demanding an equal pay grading to their male colleagues. Tomorrow marks 50 years since the day the women, who stitched car seat covers, walked out. The covers soon ran out, halting production across the plant – proving just how integral their role was in the car manufacturing process. Their landmark action, immortalised in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, is widely credited as a catalyst for the Equal Pay Act two years later. Yet despite being enshrined in law, equal pay has yet to be achieved in workplaces across the country.  The battle fought by Eileen and her colleagues continues today, as bosses are finally being forced to open up about the 18.4% gender pay gap that means women effectively work for free for two months each year. Fellow Dagenham striker Gwen Davis says: “It makes me angry and sad. Should we have to keep fighting for everything?” Gwen, 85, of Romford, East London, is frustrated that women are still subjected to lower pay and harassment at work. Like Eileen, she fully supports the high-profile campaigns that are calling out such ill treatment. “It should all be out in the open,” she says. “Why should a man think he has a right to your body?  “This year is about a lot of things, including equal pay – but overall, for women to be treated with respect. “Now women are protesting it’s revived my hope things will start to change. Women are strong compared to what they used to be, but it shouldn’t have taken 50 years. “I don’t think many people really understand what the word feminist means, still.” Pal Eileen, of nearby Rainham, encourages great-granddaughter Katie, a 20-year-old trainee nurse, to stand her ground. Eileen says: “I’ve been mad this year. I tell Katie to stick up for herself. I say to all women, stand up for yourself, go for it, call people out. We have to.”  Eileen and Gwen have never stopped fighting for equality. In February they were on the Bafta red carpet with actress Gemma Arterton, who starred in the West End musical version of Made in Dagenham. They wore black alongside the star in support of the Time’s Up movement against sexual harassment. They believe tomorrow’s anniversary is an important opportunity to speak out for what they so passionately believe in – especially coming as it does in the centenary year of women getting the vote. Although they shrug off any \u0026shysuggestion that they were personally courageous, back in 1968 it was undoubtedly brave to walk out of Ford.  Support was not always forthcoming – especially when their actions led to the plant closing down and the men getting laid off too, leaving hundreds of families strapped for cash. But they both say they never doubted. “It was difficult but we had to do it,” says Eileen. “We had no hesitation. We all got together, we asked for a meeting, hands were shown and out we walked. We were very angry. Although looking back you wonder how you did do it.” The situation the women were fighting was around grading rather than pay, initially. Despite their job requiring two years’ training, the female machinists were classified as unskilled B-grade workers, the same as floor sweepers, with the equivalent pay and pensions to cleaners.  Every year they would ask to be re-classified as C-grade semi-skilled workers, which is how men with \u0026shyequivalent training were graded. But each year they were turned down. “We had skills the same as the men,” Gwen says. “Yet we were classed the same as the teenage boys who swept the floor.” The final straw was the discovery that some male workers were being paid extra to work on the machines at night – while women were forbidden from working nights or overtime. Both women were married and had children, but say they were lucky that their husbands did not work at Ford, so one source of income kept coming in during the strike.  Both men were supportive – Eileen says her husband would put the tea on when she went off to protests. “He knew we were fighting for our rights,” she says. However, other families were not so lucky, which is why some hostility crept in. “Some said, ‘Get back to work’,” recalls Eileen. “They said we were putting the men out of work. We had to let it go over our heads.” Ultimately, for all their efforts, the women won only a partial victory. Employment Secretary Barbara Castle promised a pay rise bringing them up to 92% of the unskilled men’s wage – an improvement on their existing 85%, but still far from equal pay or the grading change they demanded. Gwen says the women had little choice but to accept the deal.

The party published amendments to the flagship EU (Withdrawal Bill), which returns to the Commons on Tuesday. In a softening of its position, Labour calls for common minimum standards, rights and protections with Brussels, and “full access to the internal market of the European Union, underpinned by shared institutions and regulations”. The party still rules out membership of the European Economic Area - an option many of its backbenchers, such as one-time leadership hopeful Chuka Umunna, want left on the table.  But the fresh move will be seen as an attempt to quell a potential backbench rebellion over the EEA, which threatens to embarrass Jeremy Corbyn .   It is understood Labour MPs will be ordered to abstain in a crunch vote on EEA membership. The UK would still quit the European Court of Justice, with a new arbitration panel set-up between the UK and EU to settle disputes. Labour would not sign up to freedom of movement - a key pillar of single market membership - and wants to negotiate a new deal on migration. Instead, it wants a new “comprehensive” customs union - a clear dividing line with the Conservatives. Theresa May has insisted the UK will leave the existing customs union and not join a new one.   Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.  “Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result. “Existing single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries. “We need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland. “Two years on from the referendum it is clear that the Government has no plan for how it will protect jobs and the economy, and guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. “Labour’s amendment, along with a commitment to negotiate a new comprehensive customs union with the EU, is a strong and balanced package that would retain the benefits of the single market. “Parliament should have the opportunity to debate and vote on it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour tory mps share experiences","story":"NewsLabour and Tory MPs share experiences of abortion in emotionally charged speeches\"We are not criminals\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporterNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent18:51, 5 JUN 2018Updated19:09, 5 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour and Tory MPs have shared their experiences of abortion, in an emotionally charged debate in the House of Commons. Tory Heidi Allen spoke of how she was ill when she made the decision to have an abortion, during a debate on reforming the law in Northern Ireland. And Labour’s Jess Philips recalled her own experience, as well as sharing stories of Northern Irish women who travelled for terminations, insisting: “We are not criminals.” Heidi Allen’s voice wobbled as she told MPs: “I was ill when I made the incredibly hard decision to have a termination. I was having seizures every day, I wasn’t even able to control my own body let alone care for a new life.  “So Mr Speaker are you seriously telling me that in a civilised world rape, incest or a foetus that is so badly deformed that it could never live are not sufficient grounds for a woman to have the power to decide for herself that she shouldn’t make that decision. “No, enough. “Very suddenly and unexpectedly we have a window of opportunity before us. Whether you feel that window has opened as a consequence of no functioning administration in Northern Ireland or because a neighbouring referendum was so close and so relevant as to be impossible to ignore, or simply because you feel the glaring light of equality and human rights illuminating the women of northern Ireland. “This has become their moment and they will have my unequivocal support.” Jess Phillips recalled how the last satnav journey of a hire car she recently collected at Birmingham Airport was to the Calthorpe Clinic in the city. She explained: The place I myself had been for an abortion a decade previously. I shuddered at the thought of the woman who had hired the car before me, not to go about her working life but to go and do something I took completely for granted - myself and (Heidi Allen, Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire) are not criminals.  Ms Phillips said last week she asked Northern Irish women to get in touch with their stories of travelling to England, Scotland and Wales. She said: Today I am them, here are some of the extracts. As Ms Phillips outlined their stories, MPs were told they said: It was Christmas Eve, I was with friends at a party. I stepped outside for a breath of air and I was raped. My mum had to book the flights, book me into a clinic. This all took money. I was from a working-class family, we had to borrow it.

The ComRes survey reveals a staggering 82% would be willing to pay 1p more in National Insurance contributions if the money went directly to the health service. The findings will pile pressure on Theresa May to pump more money into the cash-strapped NHS. In a warning to the Prime Minister, the poll also shows voters are more likely to back the party at the next election which pledges extra funds for health and social care. Four in five adults (82%) said they supported the 1p increase if the money raised - as much as \u0026pound11billion - was ring fenced to fund the NHS.  Almost as many Tory voters (81%) as Labour voters (86%) supported the tax rise. The poll also shows a third of voters (33%) would probably change their vote at the next general election in favour of a party which promised additional funding for health and social care. And 18% would definitely switch to a party which pledged extra funds.  Voters also give a damning verdict on the Conservatives’ handling of the NHS since they came to power. More than half of all adults think the quality of service in the NHS has declined since 2010 (55%), 28% say it has stayed the same and just one in ten (9%) think it has improved. Among Tory voters 45% say the NHS has declined, 37% say it has stayed the same and 14% believe it has got worse. People in England are more likely to have a negative view on their health service than those in SNP-run Scotland and Wales, where it is run by Labour.  Three quarters of people (75%) in the North East of England say the NHS has got worse, 56% in London and 65% in Yorkshire and Humber. In Scotland 48% say the quality of healthcare has declined since 2010 and in Wales, 45%. The Mirror’s poll was conducted after Gordon Brown called for a repeat of the 1p hike in National Insurance contributions to raise \u0026pound11billion for the NHS. The former Prime Minister warned the health service is in “mortal danger” and could struggle to survive in its present form without an emergency injection of funds similar to the 1p rise he introduced as Chancellor in 2002.  The NHS will soon need an extra \u0026pound40billion of funding a year, rising to \u0026pound95billion by the 2030s. At the same time it is having to cater for an ageing population which see more than 4.4million people aged 65 or over by 2033-34 Britain’s most senior doctors last night (TUE) welcomed the poll findings and called for “urgent” action to implement the 1p tax rise. Dr Kailash Chand, honorary vice president of the British Medical Association, said the results showed Brits were “prepared to pay more” to save the NHS.  Speaking to the Daily Mirror in a personal capacity, Dr Chand said: “The results from this poll could not be clearer. “I’m very pleased because they show the vast majority of people in this country still believe the NHS is one of our most precious assets - and they are prepared to pay more to save it. “More people are being seen by the our NHS than ever before, with a rising population and soaring demand with people living longer. “Yet funding of the health service since 2010 has simply not kept pace. “The results of this poll will also send a powerful message to politicians that the public believe the NHS is in such urgent need of funds, they are prepared to pay more for the NHS. “But this cannot be the only solution. The Government must urgently raise real spending rises on the heath service to at least 4% a year.”  Dr JS Bramah, a Consultant Psychiatrist and chairman of the British Association Of Physicians of Indian Origin, said the Government needed to “act now” to reverse Tory cuts to the NHS. Speaking in a personal capacity, he said: “It is reassuring that even during these stressful financial times people cherish the NHS sufficiently to dig deep into their pockets for its survival. “We need to act now to reverse the damage caused by austerity and senseless reforms, so that patients can access and get the quality services they deserve from struggling mental health services, general practices and A\u0026ampEs.” In a recent report for the IPPR, the NHS surgeon and former Labour Health Minister Lord Darzi has also backed an increase in National Insurance to fund the NHS. He said it was a “small price to pay” for a “more civilised and caring society.” The move is also supported by former Tory Health Minister Lord Prior who said it would provide the NHS with the long-term funding settlement that it needs to be fit for the 2020s. A growing number of Tory MPs have also demanded the Government increases taxes to fund the NHS.

During a celebration of America on the South Lawn of the White House, a man shouted at the President: Stop hiding behind the armed services and the National Anthem.  Another man was seen \u0027taking a knee\u0027 during the national anthem, apparently echoing sports stars who have been vilified by the Trump administration for making the public protest in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  The President had invited Superbowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles to a reception at the White House.   But when several team members declined to attend in protest against the President, the White House pulled the invitation for the whole team. Instead of cancelling the event, the White House decided to still hold the event, inviting the 1,000 Eagles fans expected to take part in the ceremony to attend a celebration of America on the White House lawn instead.  But there was some question over whether the people gathered on the South Lawn were, in fact, Eagles fans. One reporter from NBC Philadelphia said he had asked six fans to name the Eagles\u0027 quarterback in the Superbowl. Not ONE person knew, Tim Furlong reported.   During a brief speech, Trump took aim at people who refuse to stand for the National Anthem as a mark of protest. He said: We stand to show our love for our fellow citizens and our magnificent Constitution. Trump has feuded with NFL players over the past year, blasting on-field protests in which players sat or kneeled during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system amid accusations of excessive use of force against black people by police.  None of the Eagles players knelt during the playing of the anthem during the football season, but Trump brought up the anthem protests when he canceled the team\u0027s invitation on Monday after many players said they would not attend the celebration. The White House on Tuesday said it had canceled the long-established capital tradition after the Eagles said that just a handful of people would attend the event, fewer than the 81 initially proposed. At least two members of the champion team and the NFL players\u0027 union pushed back, saying that the event should have gone forward if any Eagles planned to attend. Our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans, the NFL Players Association said in a statement. NFL players love their country. In her daily briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders criticized the Eagles.

Michelle Peel booked a week at the four-star Swandor Topkapi Palace in Antalya, Turkey, as a treat for her eight-year-old daughter Evie-Anne, who is about to undergo life-changing spinal surgery. The family of nine booked the resort through Thomas Cook expecting an on-site water park, ten bars, and a kids club, but arrived to find the hotel far from finished.  Michelle told Birmingham Live there were no functioning toilets for more than 12 hours and they were plagued with constant loud drilling from building work.   She said: We were travelling because our severely disabled daughter is due to have a very dangerous, life-threatening spinal surgery in June, and she may never be able to fly again if she survives the surgery. It will be a very, very long recovery process, so we decided to have one last holiday in Turkey to make memories and spend quality time with her. The family, from Meriden, chose that particular resort due to its vast range of facilities - including a games room, water slides, and massage facilities. Michelle said she spoke with Thomas Cook and the hotel before the trip in May to confirm they would have an adapted room for Evie-Anne and that the hotel was fully accessible. The family said they were also repeatedly reassured by the travel agent that no building work would be going on at the hotel during their stay. She said: The day before we travelled we spoke to Thomas Cook about our concerns, as friends staying in the Kremlin Palace next door told us the hotel was not finished and still a building site. My daughter has severe respiratory issues and cannot be around building work, dust, and paint - I explained all this to Thomas Cook and was promised the hotel was completely finished.  The family received a letter from Thomas Cook on the day they flew informing them the hotel was under new management, and that there would be no wave pool and funfair. But when they arrived at the hotel at 3.30am next day, Michelle said much more was missing. Michelle, whose family booked three rooms, said: Other families left with the keys to their rooms - but would quickly arrive back with different reasons why the rooms were no good. Some were too small with not enough beds, others were filthy, and one even had a family sleeping in the room already, and the receptionist could not understand a word anyone was saying. Eventually we were given our keys - our dad\u0027s room was filthy and unclean. It smelt so bad - you could smell cigarettes in there and the bed wasn’t made properly. We then went to the room that was ours, and it was only one large double bed inside. We were a family of four, we were two beds short. Michelle was told the specially-adapted room she had booked for her daughter hadn\u0027t been built yet, and the hotel was unable to offer her an accessible alternative. She said: The room we took had a double bed and bunk bed. We had to put our disabled daughter in the double bed in between us, and the wheelchair only went in the doorway. It couldn\u0027t be pushed anywhere else in the room. A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook said Michelle was advised the room may not be big enough for four people when she booked, and she was recommended to book the next largest room. Michelle also said that there were no functioning toilets when they arrived - and they were told to go to the hotel next door to use the bathroom. They were fixed at 2pm the next day, but Michelle said the toilets were constantly flooded, disgusting, or unusable.  She also said her family was kept awake by loud building works, and most of the entertainment promised didn\u0027t exist until the sixth day of their trip. She said: There was no electric and no working toilets in our room, so we rang reception. He couldn\u0027t understand us at all, but we could understand: \u0027No power, toilets at Kremlin Palace\u0027. The next day we went straight to reception, and we realised the Topkapi hotel was literally a building site! As we walked around the complex the devastation hit us. The water park was closed and building work was being done all around it anyway, the amphitheatre was not finished and a building site. We were told there were shops and games rooms and bowling, and we couldn\u0027t find anything of the sort - the beach area was a complete building site, as were all the other buildings around the complex. It was very noisy - there were tractors, drilling, the floors were covered in broken concrete, cement, sand, and burst pipes were flooding everywhere. I was more concerned there were no signs up anywhere, no wet paint signs, no wet floor signs and we were literally walking through two-inch flooded areas. Everywhere within the complex was a building site and guests had to walk through it all to go anywhere.  Michelle also said groups of Russian tourists had loud parties outside her room until 4am most nights - and she witnessed a violent fist-fight by the pool. She said: Groups of Russians continued to pool party at 4am every night right outside our room, which was located next to the smaller quiet pool. On the sixth evening England was playing football and they put the game on in the small bar by the pool. It was very rowdy and when the game finished fighting broke out, glasses were being smashed everywhere and we were so scared, it was very violent. Everyone ran out but I couldn\u0027t get to the wheelchair fast enough so we had to run carrying our daughter. But Michelle said that despite flagging all their problems to Thomas Cook immediately, holiday reps could not relocate the family to a new hotel. She said: On the second day, a Thomas Cook rep arrived but there was a big queue as all the other families were crying and shouting, demanding to be moved. The rep had no awareness of the building work - he said it was his first time on site and he hadn\u0027t had chance to look around yet. I was sobbing. I explained that our daughter was severely disabled - she\u0027s registered blind, fully tube fed, fully wheelchair dependant, with very low muscle tone. She\u0027s non-verbal, she has epilepsy, dystonia, reflux, and scoliosis. She\u0027s on long-term morphine and lots of medication and she couldn’t be somewhere like this.

Joanne Wall, 48, had mentioned the almost-invisible bump on her nose in passing to her doctor while visiting them over an unrelated issue. She was shocked to find out that the spot was, in fact, skin cancer . Following her diagnosis in March, the gran-of-two underwent facial surgery to cut out the disease and stretch skin from her cheek across her nose. She has now been left with a vivid bumpy, red scar in the shape of a heart across her nose, and her confidence when out in public has been knocked.  Despite her upcoming wedding to partner Craig Middlebrook, 49, in September, brave Joanne is positive surgery was the right treatment option to take. She says she couldn\u0027t have done it without her husband-to-be by her side. The bride, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: I would have lived with this for years if it hadn\u0027t flared up during my doctor\u0027s appointment. I don\u0027t know what would have happened. I had had this little blotch visible on my nose for some years - it was so tiny that it wasn\u0027t visible to anybody else. Because it was so small and unnoticeable I didn\u0027t think it could be anything bad. I used to assume maybe it was a spot that hadn\u0027t come through yet. I used to squeeze it. I thought it was a blocked pore and that it would go away. I went to the doctor for something unrelated and I asked him to have a look at it. I was a bit panicky with the diagnosis but at the time he did reassure me.  He said, \u0027I know cancer is a scary word but this one is the best type to get\u0027. A consultant diagnosed Joanne\u0027s \u0027blocked pore\u0027 as a 3mm basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cutaneous nodule with telangiectasia. He suggested several different treatment options including radiotherapy, but the gran opted to have surgery. She was booked in to have a bilateral cheek-to-nose advancement flap, where surgeons would cut out the nodule and stretch the skin across her nose to cover up the gap. She said: I always thought I had a pretty high pain threshold. But the pain afterwards was horrendous. I would sleep sitting up constantly. There was a constant throbbing of my nose and behind my eyes. I\u0027ve never known anything like it. The people that go through rhinoplasty - I take my hat off to them. My problem at the moment is that foundations just settle into the scars and make it more prominent. When it\u0027s on your face it\u0027s the first thing that people see.  She recalled how a stranger on one occasion asked her if she had been bitten by a dog. It has knocked my confidence. It\u0027s quite a lot to get your head around, she said. I do have days where I think to myself should I have left it until after the wedding? But although at times I hate looking in the mirror, the unconditional support and love from my partner, who tells me I\u0027m beautiful no matter what, gets me through. Although Joanne briefly used sunbeds, she believes her cancer dates back to sun exposure in her childhood. Later in life, she says she was always careful to use sun cream and even used to be laughed at by her friends for using SPF 50. But she claims sun protection just wasn\u0027t thought of when she was a little girl. Joanne said: The consultant said it could have been sun damage from when I was a child. I was born in 1970 and people weren\u0027t really sun aware back then. I can never remember my mum buying sun cream or putting sunscreen on me.

Philip Muspratt started decorating his house with the empty cans and bottles in 2005, creating ornate patterns around the doors and windows of the semi-detached home. The artistically-minded lager fan, who passed away in 2015 aged 63, even built a water feature and BBQ in the back garden of the Hartlepool home on Raby Road. While many neighbours reportedly admired his decorating achievements, some saw the beer cans as an eyesore on the street.  The home even featured in a 52-minute documentary in 2012 called \u0027The Can House\u0027, the Hartlepool Mail reported. In recent years, Hartlepool Council began demolishing much of the estate to make way for new builds. But despite numerous attempts to move them on, the Muspratt family refused to give up their unique looking home, turning down a number of offers from the council, reports claim. But now they have seemingly left the house and all of its beer bottles behind with pictures showing its windows boarded up. Metal mesh is also over the doors and a fence has been erected outside.

Dr Vaishnavy Vilvanathan Laxman mistakenly carried out a natural delivery, even though the premature infant was in the breech condition. Tragically the baby\u0027s head was detached inside his mum\u0027s womb. A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MTPS) panel found Laxman, 43, should have given the 30-year-old patient an emergency Caesarean section. The first-time mum was 25 weeks pregnant when it happened at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee in March 2014.  The panel said the only appropriate course was a caesarean section as the baby - known as baby B - was in the breech position. His head became trapped during the birth, and his head became detached from his body during efforts to free him. MTPS said he had died before this happened. On Tuesday, the tribunal cleared Dr Laxman of serious misconduct and said her fitness to practise was not impaired.

Dylan Harris was a seven-year-old schoolboy when he started filling his ‘Mexico 86’ album. He spent hours swapping stickers with classmates in the playground but failed to get the full set. But dedicated Dylan kept his bundle of ‘swaps’ and vowed to one day finish the iconic album. He spent the next three decades tirelessly searching for the players he needed to complete the book.  His big break came with the launch of niche websites, allowing collectors to swap their stickers online. Dylan, now 39, quickly began filling his album - replacing his ‘gots’ with sought after ‘needs’. He sourced one sticker from a collector 4,800 miles away in Venezuela, South America.  For the last three years one sticker eluded Dylan - the relatively unheard of French goalkeeper Albert Rust. But last month he tracked it down 1,500 miles away in Italy - finally completing the iconic sticker book. Incredibly he finished the book without spending any money, instead relying on ‘swaps’.  Dylan, from Wigan, said: “After the World Cup I was stuck with a half empty album and a big pile of swaps I was unable to exchange. “I figured I\u0027d keep them just in case there was ever anyone to swap them with in the future. “Then, in the early 2000s, websites started to appear where people would swap their old stickers online.  “I slowly started to find the occasional person to make a handful of swaps with, but it was a long drawn out process.” Bobby Robson’s England were infamously knocked out in the quarter-finals after the ‘Hand of God’ game against Argentina. Argentina, captained by Diego Maradona, went on to lift the trophy by beating West Germany 3-2 in the final. Dylan is now trying to complete a Panini album from the 1970 World Cup, which was held in Brazil.

Alfie Wiseman claims he was asked to leave by security staff before they \u0027grabbed\u0027 him and \u0027threw his belongings out of the door\u0027. His girlfriend Jodie Work, was admitted to hospital when she lost two litres of blood and suffered a miscarriage. The pair met five years ago and already have a seven-month-old girl, Aaliyah-Rose, but they found out they were expecting another baby this year.  Jodie, 22, was 11-weeks pregnant when she went to the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) in Harlow with a small bleed.  I went to the hospital and asked for a scan, she told Essex Live .  They told me to come back on Thursday as I was due for an appointment. Later that evening I started gushing out blood at my home. I needed an ambulance and I had lost two litres of blood. I was losing more and I waited over an hour for an ambulance to arrive. Jodie claims when she arrived at the hospital she was left sitting in A\u0026ampE for 30 minutes before being transferred to another room. She said: I was left in a room with bits of my baby and blood on me. After they had tragically lost the baby, Alfie sat by her side but was asked to leave because Jodie was staying on a female-only ward. She requested to move so that she didn\u0027t have to be alone, but this didn\u0027t happen. Jodie said: Alfie is going through the same as me and just because he is the father doesn\u0027t mean it isn\u0027t affecting him, but they sent security down to move him. Alfie, 24, added: I saw what she was going though and she didn\u0027t want me to leave so I asked If I could stay longer. The staff who dish out the tea said they would ask a manager.  Next thing, security came and asked me to leave. They don’t care. Alfie left the ward as directed by security staff and decided to sit in the waiting room. He added: I didn’t feel comfortable going home when she was still in the hospital. The security guard grabbed me by the arm and I was trying to explain to them what happened, to see if he had a little bit of a heart, but he had nearly broken my arm. Alfie then claims the staff threw his bag and belongings out the door so he would leave. I was in a big state and asked to see the managers, who then came down and apologised for the incident, he explained. Staff at PAH then allowed the dad to stay longer in the ward to spend time with Jodie. Jodie said the treatment she received whilst recovering was not up to standards and feels the nurses were not sympathetic to her situation. The mum said: Other children kept coming in to visit their mums and nurses were talking to other staff, saying it was their two-year-old son\u0027s birthday. She said: The nurses kept leaving my curtain open and I wanted to be on my own. I pressed for the nurse and she came over and said \u0027I\u0027m getting sick of you pressing the buzzer, what did your last slave die of?\u0027 I asked her to close the curtain and she said, \u0027Can\u0027t you get up and do it yourself?\u0027, when I am lying there having a blood transfusion and I just lost a baby.

For one of the nation’s best loved dressings has fallen out of favour with modern Brits as just 14% drizzle it over their lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. According to research by the snack giant, the under 30s prefer to slather it over tuna, ham or cheese in sandwiches or use it as an alternative to mayonnaise for chips. Launched in 1914 specifically for the UK market, the condiment with a signature tang, took eight years to perfect for British tastebuds.  But the bottles are set for a dramatic makeover as American owner Kraft Heinz revealed it no longer reflects the UK’s changing palette. Heinz is now working with trendy London design agency Jones Knowles Ritchie on a revamp after revealing the traditional salad dressing’s name did not “fairly represent the product’s ingredients or usage occasions”. A spokesperson told trade journal The Grocer: “As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers. “There are consumers now who haven’t grown up with the brand in the household and just don’t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.” New look bottles are expected to hit supermarket shelves in September with the name change aimed at younger shoppers.

Researchers found working longer hours, having less disposable income and social media distractions mean fewer of us are able to take time out and enjoy traditional pastimes. Stamp collecting, embroidery and building models also featured as interests which Brits aren’t so interested in any more.  The study was commissioned by online casino, Casumo , as part of their latest ‘Play Absurd’ campaign - casumo/playabsurd - and found playing sports, travelling and gardening featured among the more popular hobbies.   A spokesman for Casumo said: “Having a hobby is a great way to focus your time, whether that be to get some time to yourself or meet new people along the way.   “Although our research showed certain hobbies aren’t as popular now, we want to celebrate the variety of hobbies out there, regardless of how unusual.” The study also found three quarters agreed hobbies bring them and their partner closer together with half using it as something to talk about. One quarter enjoy gardening and pruning the bushes with their loved ones, with one in 10 couples hiking and four in 10 going for nice walks together. In fact, one in 10 are keen to take up a new interest with their significant other but worried it might be a bit on the unusual side. With nearly one quarter willing to take up wife carrying and husband dragging as a hobby. In a bid to offset boredom, one quarter would like to try pie eating as a hobby, with nine per cent willing to have a go at bog snorkelling and six per cent keen to attempt extreme ironing.  Of other absurd activities, one in 10 would participate in egg tossing, with as many Brits willing to try gurning and 16 per cent would give marbles a go. One fifth of those polled get involved in different leisure pursuits to keep their mind sharp. Eighteen per cent use their interests as a chance for a bit of ‘me-time’, with one in 20 treating it as a chance to make friends. Despite a nation with keen interests, of the one quarter with no hobbies half of them wish they had an interest to call their own. But a lack of time, interest and companions to kick-start it with means they aren’t spending any free time they have in a way they would like.  Nearly half of Brits reckoned they have less time now than they used to for leisurely activities and nearly a third agreed hobbies are becoming less commonplace. However, the poll of 2,000 adults revealed some of the more unusual hobbies circulating the nation including candle making, origami and even collecting Aston Villa football programmes.

Convicted drug dealer Sam Walker, from Liverpool, mocked police on camera saying: Better luck trying to catch me when I go out of the country next time, Merseyside Police.” The criminal, who has clocked up more than 100 crimes, fled to Sierra Leone using private jets and a cargo ship. Despite his criminal past, Walker is considered a hero in the country\u0027s capital Freetown after paying for fresh water pipes and tanks to be fitted in the area. Walker claimed he faced being jailed in the UK for skipping court over breaking an alleged driving ban.  His video, shown to pals on Snapchat and Instagram, was titled: “How to get out of UK when you\u0027re wanted by police. Can’t use an airport coz they will nick you.” The footage shows Walker flying in a private plane to Belgium. He then takes another personal flight to Barcelona, Spain, before hitching a “little 14-hour boat trip” to Morocco. He is then driven across Africa for three days - across the Sahara, Mauritania and Senegal - to Guinea before taking another boat to Freetown.  Walker, whose grandfather was from Sierra Leone, claims he was forced to evade police because his court date clashed with the departure of a shipping container from the UK filled with charity donations. He now faces a longer prison stretch when he returns home - but in the meantime has enjoyed time with Sierra Leone’s vice-president, Mohammed Juldeh Jalloh. Speaking from the country, Walker insisted: “I was in a Catch-22. I had to fulfil my promise to the people in the slums, knowing full well that when am caught I will get the maximum sentence of four months in jail plus two months for missing my court date.  “But to me the people were more important. The court date could wait. Sometimes in life you have to do the wrong thing in the eyes of the law in order to do the right thing.” Walker has been in and out of prison since his teenage years and made front page headlines when he publicly threatened former Everton and England star Barkley. The sinister Twitter message, sparked in a row over an ex-girlfriend of the footballer, said: “Inbox me a number for you, ya little rat! “You know wot this is about so don’t play stupid or your footie career will come to an end!” He now claims to have spent thousands on installing fresh water pipes for the slums of Sierra Leone after seeing “men, women and children dying”.  Walker said: “I managed to convince them to start fitting a fresh water line for them and I paid for it there and then to make sure it was 100% being done. They have installed a 5,000 litre water tank in the slums so no woman or child has to ever drink dirty water again.” Yet Walker, who has been in and out of prison since a teenager, denies he is a changed person despite the charitable mission. He admitted: “I have not just woke up and changed overnight. I am still the same person and still do what I do. “But that does not mean I can’t help the people who need it and give them a voice. “I know when I come back to the UK I will be arrested at the airport and put straight in jail. “I can deal with that knowing that I have fulfilled my promise to the people in the slums by giving them a container full of toys, clothes and food and given them fresh clean water so no man, woman or child ever has to risk their lives by drinking dirty sewage water again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office tells","story":"NewsUK weather: Met Office tells Brits to expect MORE thunderstorms days after 60,000 lightning strikesHayfever sufferers will also be badly affected this week as the perfect storm of conditions hits the south of the UK\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills19:08, 5 JUN 2018Updated19:10, 5 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore thunderstorms are set to batter Britain bringing with them rain and lightning.

Hayfever sufferers will also be badly affected this week as the perfect storm of conditions hits the south of the UK.

But tourists have been warned to avoid certain areas unless it\u0027s essential, with the threat of terror attacks in several places in Europe and beyond. Where is safe to go and where should you avoid travelling to? What precautions should you take while travelling? Here we take a look at the UK Government’s travel advice for destinations across the globe. Turkey  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all travel to within 10 km of the border with Syria and to the city of Diyarbakir. The FCO said: Fighting in Syria continues in areas close to the Turkish border and there remains a heightened risk of terrorism in the region. They warned that presidential and parliamentary elections will take place on 24 June 2018 which may result in rallies and demonstrations around the country. You should avoid large gatherings and follow the advice of the local authorities, the advice added. Added security measures may apply to flights from Turkey to the UK.  Egypt Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Egypt, the FCO says. People have been told they should always be vigilant and follow advice of Egyptian authorities and travel companies. Threats to western nationals, institutions and businesses have been posted on websites and social media. The FCO has advised against travel - unless it\u0027s essential- to the Governorate of South Sinai with the exception of the area within the Sharm el Sheikh perimeter barrier, which includes the airport and the areas of Sharm el Maya, Hadaba, Naama Bay, Sharks Bay and Nabq. But people have been advised against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el Sheikh. Places to avoid also include the area west of the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions, excluding the coastal areas between the Nile Delta and Marsa Matruh.  Spain Barcelona and other areas in the region of Catalonia have seen large gatherings because of the political developments in the region. And the Government has warned more demonstrations could take place. They may occur with little or no warning and even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can escalate and turn confrontational, the FCO says. You should exercise caution if you’re in the vicinity. Demonstrations may also cause some disruption and delays to transport services. The FCO have also urged people to not take unnecessary risks, especially when under the influence of alcohol after several deaths as a result from people falling from balconies. They also warned people to be aware of the existence of street crime as thieves tend to target money and passports.  GreeceTerrorist attacks in Greece can’t be ruled out, the FCO says. Brits have been told to apply for a free European Health Insurance Card and to carry their passport or photo ID showing British nationality at all times. Some medical costs are not covered by the European Health Insurance Card so people have been told to get comprehensive medical and travel insurance before going to Greece. The FCO says: Greek police won’t accept rowdy or indecent behaviour, especially where excessive drinking is involved. Greek courts impose heavy fines or prison sentences on people who behave indecently. Your travel insurance may not cover you after drinking.  France It is very likely that terrorists carry out attacks in France, according to the Goverment. The country has had ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups. The French government has advised the public to be vigilant and has reinforced its security measures. People should also be aware that a number of strikes are being planned on SNCF trains until June 28 and should check travel advice.  USA Terror attacks in the USA are very likely and could be indiscriminate, the Government has warned. People should be vigilant and check reports in the press. The US Department of Homeland Security is to start implementing separate enhanced security screening procedures for all commercial flights to the US.

From learners on the motorway to stricter MOTs, there\u0027s a lot to take in. We\u0027ve teamed up with the experts at Halfords to give Mirror readers the lowdown on everything you need to know. Our team have been through the official information and below are some of the most important things to remember. Get your car in shape before the MOT   The new rules for MOTs introduced this month mean that there are new categorisation for problems. The new MOT system uses the following classifications: * Dangerous : this is a fail and you are not allowed to drive the car. * Major : this is a fail but you can drive to a garage to have the issue fixed. * Minor : the car has passed but there are issues that need fixing. The car isn\u0027t dangerous or polluting the environment. * Advisory : the car has passed but the issue could become more serious in future - monitor and repair if necessary * Meet the standard: the car meets the minimum legal standard - make sure it continues to meet the standard. If you get ‘major’ or ‘dangerous’ then you\u0027ll fail. Dangerous faults must be repaired before you can drive the car again. Major faults mean that you could drive the car to a garage for repairs as long as the car has time left on the existing MOT. Advisory still exists as a category too, so you need to keep a close eye on these. You\u0027ll still pass, but it\u0027s likely that these will become more serious with time.  You can check your car in advance for common MOT fails before you take it to be tested. Doing this means you should be able to fix problems before your test. You can also book a Free Car Check at Halfords which includes:  Bulb Check Wiper Blades Check Battery Check Engine oil level check Windscreen Chip Check Plus Free Screenwash Top Up   It can be somewhat complicated working out what oil you need to buy for your car. (The Mobil Super 3000 , for example, is best suited to engines that have been designed to use a low viscosity (HTHS) motor oil.) The Halfords Oil Finder will tell you all you need to know - just pop in your car details and it will give you suitable oil for topping up. Once you\u0027re ready for your MOT, book with Halfords Autocentre for a 45 per cent discount on the DVSA maximum fee. Common MOT failures  Because the MOT now tests for some new things you\u0027ll want to check these before taking your car in. You must make sure that your tyres are properly inflated. Warning lights on your dashboard that indicate a problem with your brakes are also a reason for the car to fail too, so check for these. Contaminated brake fluid will also be a fail from now on too as will any leaks that pose an environmental risk – like oil from the engine or gearbox. If your car has headlight washers then they must work on cars registered from September 1, 2009. Many MOT fails are quite simple problems to fix. So make sure that you have no chips or cracks in your windscreen. If you do, consider Halfords weRepair service, which will fix a chip for just \u0026pound25 at a time that suits you. It\u0027s also common to fail for a blown car bulb, so check these before you book in a test. Halfords can supply bulbs for all makes and models of car. If you\u0027re not sure if you can fit them yourself – and they can sometimes be very awkward – Halfords will do it for you and it only costs \u0026pound8 for a headlight or \u0026pound5 for other lights. The WeFit service also covers wiper blade fitting from \u0026pound2 or a battery from \u0026pound15. Cars registered for the first time after 1 March 2018 will also need to have working daytime running lights. These cars won’t go through the MOT process until 2021 though, so this is something to be aware of in the future and to add to your pre-MOT checklist. Beware using a phone for navigation  The law on using a mobile is clear: don\u0027t do it. Fines are stiff so don\u0027t take risks here and get a car holder for your phone. The Halfords One Touch Car Mount , above, is priced from \u0026pound8. The fine on the other hand could be as much as \u0026pound1,000 if you go to court, or \u0026pound200 with six points if you\u0027re given a fixed penalty notice. Bear in mind too that you can also get three points if you have an obstructed view of the road. That means you need to take care when mounting your sat nav or mobile phone holder – check this Halfords blog post for more detail. Don’t be tempted to play with your phone when driving. Even when in a mount it’s not legal to do so.  If you want to avoid the risks of having a phone to distract you then a sat nav is an ideal way to stay focused but still get directions. Modern sat navs also feature alerts about heavy traffic and the Garmin Drive , above, even has lifetime map updates, so you\u0027ll never go down a street the wrong way because of out-of-date maps. The Garmin Drive is just \u0026pound79 too (save \u0026pound20).

Footage shows how Good Samaritans searched through a refuse dump and discover the hidden child wrapped inside a number of plastic bags. Bystanders are audibly shocked as it is revealed the bags actually contains the body of a small infant. The infant makes no noise as a man carefully opens the bags to finally free it, and then whisks the baby off to seek urgent medical treatment.  Although quiet, the baby can be seen moving in the footage, both when it is found and then again when being looking after in hospital. It is unclear where the video was filmed but internet users have pointed out that the group are speaking Pidgin French, spoken in many parts of West Africa. It is unclear from the footage what happened to the baby or who left it in the dump.

It was a big move for me.“Bobby Geddes (keeper coach) has been great and the gaffer has been brilliant because he’s put faith in me to put me on the bench and play me in the last game.“That’s the biggest thing for a goalkeeper, having the manager’s faith in you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/34199517_10160329796320562_5304264978264489984_n.jpg ","title":"dundee people age no barrier as dundonians pick up new instruments with music academy launch","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFrom a four-year-old to a 77-year-old, the visitors to Dundee Music Academy\u0026#8217s opening weekend found age doesn\u0026#8217t matter when it comes to learning an instrument.More than 150 people took up the offer of free music lessons to launch the Academy at Dundee Music Studios last weekend.\u0026#8220The aim was to inspire the people of Dundee and highlight the amazing benefits of music,\u0026#8221 organiser David Gourlay said.\u0026#8220We were very happy with the turn out and the mix of ages was fantastic, from the youngest being four to the oldest 77, we had a great time with a lovely group of people.Music a big part of life for Dundee music tutor\u0026#8220Each person was given the opportunity for free to try as many music lessons as they wanted in guitar, piano, drums, bass and singing.\u0026#8221He said the feedback had been great, with lots of the people who attended booking in the following week for lessons.\u0026#8220But the most important thing for us was seeing the enjoyment and happiness people felt whilst taking their lessons,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220Our team of tutors had a great weekend passing on some of their knowledge and after 22 hours of teaching for free they all agreed that they found it so rewarding that they would do it again!\u0026#8220So we have decided that we should host this type of event numerous times throughout the year.\u0026#8220In fact we noticed that lots of people missed out on the chance to get a free music lesson due to prior commitments and variety of different reasons so we want to offer everyone at any time the chance to book in a try a first lesson for free with any of our tutors.\u0026#8221He said the benefits of playing music were \u0026#8220incredible\u0026#8221.\u0026#8220Everyone loves music, it’s one of life’s greatest gifts but few know just how mentally, physically and emotionally rewarding it is to play an instrument.\u0026#8220Playing an instrument increases memory, enhances coordination, teaches discipline, perseverance and patience, builds confidence, sharpens your concentration, relieves stress and allows self-expression, it creates a sense of achievement as you develop your ability, and there are so many more benefits but most of all, it’s make you happy and everyone deserves to feel happy,\u0026#8221 he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fd93edebe.jpg ","title":"dundee people drama students to stage legally blonde","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of drama students had a day at the theatre to help them get into character.Youngsters from the Stage Academy Theatre School, Dundee, took a trip up to Aberdeen to see the Legally Blonde UK tour.Senior students from the academy will be performing their own version of Legally Blonde at the Whitehall Theatre on June 23-24.Class teacher Lauren McRuvie said: “The students thoroughly enjoyed the trip and it was made even more special when, at the end of the performance, we met professional actress Laura Harrison, who has played the role of Vivienne in the tour.“Our student Katie Stewart, who is playing Vivienne in our production, was delighted to be photographed with her.”Younger students are also gearing up for their performance of Annie Kids on the same dates.Lauren added: “All of our students are working extremely hard towards their performances.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fd95c017d.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundees mix up kids base designs on beijing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKids from Mix Up Theatre had a blast at Dundee Design Parade.The kids were partnered with designer Lynsey Smiles and their chosen city was Beijing.The drama students studied the ancient Chinese art form of Peking Opera and they designed costumes, make-up and props.

be able to do it any more because he\u0026#8217ll be going to nursery full time.\u0026#8220And it would just be a shame to see all that hard work go, and it\u0026#8217s good for the

I remember there were discussions in recent years to reduce the number of gulls.“Judging by these images I can’t see any justification that any such steps have been taken to cull the gulls or remove eggs from nests.“You just need to look at the roof next to the casino and the gym you can see hundreds of them at any time.”Lynne Short, city development convener, said: “I will be in contact with the refuse teams to survey the bins as it appears the current provisions aren’t adequate enough.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “Bins have been provided in many areas where, previously, waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Pest control officers are involved in removing eggs and nests throughout breeding season, and while this greatly reduces incidences of aggressive behaviour and disrupts and reduces the breeding pattern, it can take between five and seven years to take hold.“Gulls are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.“It allows for the destruction of birds under certain circumstances, but this is only permissible where it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to public safety or public health, and only when all other non-lethal methods of control have been discounted.“We would also ask that people do not feed gulls as this only exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0fc28eb0d71-400x564.jpg ","title":"no barrier for youth at dundee as dens becoming the place for youngsters to flourish","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee is fast becoming the place for youth to shine in the Premiership with manager Neil McCann saying there’s “no barrier” to youngsters stepping up the first team.Eight players from the Development U/20s side made the move up throughout the last campaign, some for just one game, others for a lot longer.The stand-out among them, though he dropped out of the top-team picture since the winter, Kerr Waddell, picked up the club’s Young Player of the Year award after an impressive debut season that saw him make 22 appearances, scoring three times.Joining him on the field with the senior men were Jesse Curran (eight appearances), Matty Henvey (4), Cedwyn Scott (three), Calum Ferrie (two), Dan Jefferies (two), Jack Lambert (two) and Jordan Piggott (one).And gaffer Neil has laid down the challenge to his young charges to prove to him they are better than his existing squad players as well as the names he’s looking to bring in via the transfer market.He said: “There shouldn’t be limits on the kids. I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

I modified a design someone had uploaded to the internet as I thought it was just about perfect for him.“All I had to do was personalise it for the size of Bruce after I measured him, I then used a programme to design a buggy for his body with the correct width of the arc for the front wheels so as not to interfere with his poorly legs.“I get a lot of pleasure from being able to help people with anything they may need designed from a new door nameplate to the wheels for Bruce, you imagine it and I will try to build it, you are only limited by your imagination.“I did see a big difference when I saw him after a week and I think we are just about there.”In addition to both of his front legs being dislocated, Bruce also has underdeveloped joints and non- cancerous tumours in his eyes as well as having stunted growth.He has received daily massages and hydrotherapy treatment – sometimes up to three times a day – in a bid to increase his strength.Bruce was so small on arriving at their home that he could fit into the palm of Robyn’s hand.His wheels – complete with his very own nameplate – were created through a 3D printer with the design meaning Robyn and mum Jayne Kelly can have it adjusted should Bruce grow out of it.Robyn, Jayne and other family members have been out to meet Colin several times so Bruce could test out the prototype.This was the first time that Colin, of Polepark, had designed a prototype for an animal.His creation is now available on free design-sharing website Thingverse, with hundreds of people showing an interest in adapting his work.Colin said: “I’m normally used to working with humans and altering wheelchairs, which I’ve done for about 20 years.“This was the first time I’ve done anything for animals and it’s something I would happily do again if the opportunity came up. It took a couple of trials to get it almost perfect and after a couple of weeks I found a third wheel at the back to stabilise him was ideal.“The advantage of 3D printing is that if he does grow any more it is easy to change the size and print a replacement and the current model is configurable so I can adjust the height later.“I’ve spent about four to five years working with 3D printing and I’ve definitely seen a big difference in the quality of the designs that I’ve been able to come up with.“I’m just glad I was able to help Bruce improve and it’s been quite pleasing to see the reaction that I’ve had to the design.“It means that people can now go and adapt it however they like and to suit whatever situation.“Hopefully that will go some way to making a difference.”VIDEO: Adorable pup Bruce shows off his custom made wheels after being saved by Dundee family\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/5a0d808493e8c.jpg ","title":"volunteers needed to provide debt advice to dundees poorest folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Christian charity is calling on parishioners in Dundee to volunteer as debt advisers to help the city’s poorest families.Community Money Advice, which supports church-run advice centres throughout Britain, will host a Debt in Dundee event at 11am next Tuesday at the Steeple on Nethergate.The event is open to church leaders and volunteers, and will discuss the debt crisis and how it can be tackled.Stephen Curran, manager of CMA’s Scottish affiliate Community Money Advice Scotland (CMAS), said: “We value the excellent advice already on offer locally through Dundee City Council, Dundee Citizens Advice Bureau and others.“And we recognise the work of St Peter’s Free Church leading a Christians Against Poverty debt centre in partnership with Broughty Ferry Baptist Church, Grace Church in Menzieshill and Hillbank Evangelical Church in the Hilltown.Any effort we are able to encourage through other Dundee churches will complement not compete with existing services.“The need for additional support is clear.

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent. The local government needs-based funding formula takes into account a number of factors such as rural and island communities, as well as road length and number of school pupils.\"A spokesman for the UK Treasury said: \"We\u0026rsquove helped make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved bodies in the world and they have a full range of tax powers to raise funds.\"Wednesday 6 Jun 2018 6:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04105000/04105690.jpg","title":"East of Inverness plans include bid for 3000 new homes","story":"\u0026nbspA VISION for 3000 new homes, three schools and a 30-acre district park for Inverness will be formally unveiled later this week \u0026ndash amid fierce opposition.While public feedback has included optimism about improved transport potential, fears have been raised that a fresh focus on the swathe of farmland between Barn Church Road and the Inverness College UHI could \"undermine investment confidence\" in the nearby Stratton new town project which is already under way.The Inverness East development brief prepared by Highland Council planners will be considered for adoption by city councillors on Thursday.The blueprint \u0026ndash which does not estimate the overall cost \u0026ndash aims to ensure expansion is \"co-ordinated, offering a clear vision and the right facilities to support new communities\".A draft version was approved for consultation last November. Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

It’s has been a very, very fast process here.\u0026#8220It’s one of the advantages of the technology we’ve used. I can’t see anything else being quicker.”Vattenfall installation manager Alistair Leighton agrees: “One installation only took two hours and forty minutes and we’ve got vessels that can lay the field very quickly.Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm has embraced all sorts of new technology and some of that was really familiar to people who traditionally work in oil and gas.“There’s so much scope for skills to be transferred from oil and gas to renewable energy in the north-east.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth worker in running to be peoples champion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen youth worker has spoken of her joy at being named as a finalist for an award celebrating council employees.Amanda Pirie, 34, is the youth work co-ordinator for Printfield Projects in Woodside and is responsible for everything from planning events and activities to managing the youth workers at the project.The lifelong Woodside resident is a finalist for the People’s Champion category at the STAR Awards, which recognises council workers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty.Amanda said: “I got an email last week saying that I was a finalist, I’m really, really chuffed about it.“Obviously none of us like to talk ourselves up, but it’s nice to be recognised for the hard work that we do.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus.

Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp.

He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177.

The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017).

Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 26","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 02/06/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.What a spell of weather we have had over the past week and more.Knowing the Argyll climate, by the time you read this you might be sitting in a blizzard in front of the fire enjoying your paper but it was good while it lasted.Welcome as it is, warm weather brings its own problems.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"gym group set open 24","story":"NewsThe Gym Group set to open 24 hour facilities in AyrThe group which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:26, 5 JUN 2018NewsHeathfield Retail Park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 24-hour gym is to become the newest tenant at Ayr’s Heathfield Retail Park, as the firm’s expansion across Scotland continues. The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.   But he pointed out the Bible said women who commit adultery should be stoned, which people would be horrified by.  He added: “Jesus has a bias towards the downtrodden and excluded.”  And he appealed for same-sex couples and gay people in the congregation to “stick with us”. He added: “I am aware of your hurt and disappointment, as I acknowledge mine, but it is amazing what can happen when people pray and try to see what it really feels like from another person’s perspective.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Celtic fan Tom hopes to make a meal of it in Malawi","story":"TO many, it may seem a trip of a lifetime, but for Selkirk\u0026rsquos Tom Stevenson, it will be no holiday in Malawi.\nThe ardent Celtic supporter has followed his team around the world, but never to Malawi where he is travelling to in June as part of the Celtic Foundation.\nIt is a way of giving practical support through the Foundation to Mary\u0026rsquos Meals.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe.

in inner London over the vehicle\u0026rsquos lifetime on the road at \u0026pound7,714.\nFor diesel cars in the heart of the city, the\u0026nbsphealth costs from pollutants nitrogen dioxide and tiny particles known as particulate matter or PM2.5, is as high as \u0026pound16,424, the report released ahead of Clean Air Day on June 21 found.\nOn average across the country,\u0026nbsphealth costs from air pollution that could be attributed to a typical UK car running on fossil fuels over its 14-year\u0026nbsplifetime amount to \u0026pound1,640, while a van costs \u0026pound5,107 over its nine years on the road.\nBattery-powered electric vehicles are much less dangerous to health because they create no tailpipe emissions, though they still generate polluting particles through wear on tyres and braking.\nThe health damage from emissions from diesel vehicles, which produce far more nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, is about five times higher than petrol vehicles and 20 times greater than for electric vehicles.\nIf every new car in 2019\u0026nbsp were electric it would save more than \u0026pound325 million in health costs in the first year, according to environmental charity

report said.\nAbout a quarter of the problem is caused by cars and vans, according to the researchers, with costs due to the early deaths as well as hospital admissions and treatment of illnesses related to breathing dirty air.\nNearly 90% of all the health costs associated with pollution from cars and vans is down to diesel vehicles.\nDr Alistair Hunt from the University of Bath

Action Plan said:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoThis report clearly illustrates the true cost of air pollution from each petrol and diesel car and van, particularly in inner cities. \nHe said switching a million cars from diesel to electric would save more than \u0026pound360 million in health costs from local air pollution, while ditching the car for walking or cycling in a quarter of journeys would save \u0026pound1.1 billion.\n\u0026ldquoThis demonstrates the impact that people\u0026rsquos individual choices can have, so we would look to the government to use Clean Air Day as a springboard for year round public engagement through its new clean air strategy.\nGlobal Action Plan has found that London tops the league of worst UK cities for the costs to the NHS of pollution from cars and vans, totalling \u0026pound605 million, while Birmingham\u0026rsquos vehicles cost around \u0026pound150 million.\nAlison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said the economic case for cleaning up the air we breathe had been \u0026ldquolaid bare.\nMeanwhile Sue Hayman, Labour\u0026rsquos shadow environment secretary, said the Government had failed to take decisive and quick action to tackle the \u0026ldquopublic health emergency.\n\u0026ldquoAir pollution has been at illegal levels for years under this Conservative Government and now we know the true cost to the NHS of their inaction, she said.\n\u0026ldquoThe time for endless consultations and shunting this problem onto local councils has to end.\nMartin Tett, environment spokesman at the Local Government Association, said Government plans needed to be underpinned by local flexibility, appropriate powers and sufficient funding.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoIf we\u0026rsquore to truly tackle air pollution, we need Government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission\u0026nbspvehicles and power

watchdog has confirmed it is investigating TSB\u0026rsquos troubled IT migration as the head of a committee of MPs warned she is \u0026ldquodeeply concerned about how problems were communicated.\nThe head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a letter to Treasury Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan that the regulator would carry out a joint investigation with the Prudential Regulation Authority.\nAndrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, noted: \u0026ldquoWe do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.\nMrs Morgan released correspondence with the watchdog in which Mr Bailey said TSB chief executive Paul Pester\u0026rsquos evidence to the committee in May was \u0026ldquoan optimistic view and \u0026ldquogreater caution would have made sense.\nCommons Treasury Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan (Dominic Lipinski/PA)\nMr Bailey said Dr Pester could have shared \u0026ldquomore detail with the committee, including the initial views of a team of experts from IBM who were drafted in to help solve the crisis.\nUp to 1.9 million people using TSB\u0026rsquos digital and mobile banking found themselves locked out of their bank accounts following the migration of data on customers from former owner Lloyds\u0026rsquo IT system to a new one managed by current owner Sabadell.\nLast month, Dr Pester told MPs on the Treasury Committee that he took \u0026ldquoabsolute responsibility for the problems, but said the migration of billions of customer records was successful \u0026ldquoto the penny and the underlying engine of the bank was \u0026ldquoworking well.\nHe is due to appear in front of the committee again on Wednesday.\nTSB chief executive Paul Pester is to face a further grilling from the Treasury Committee (Nick Ansell/PA)\nIn his May 30 letter responding to Mrs Morgan\u0026rsquos request for information, Mr Bailey wrote: \u0026ldquoThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u0026rsquos communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced, adding that the bank\u0026rsquos response \u0026ldquocould reduce trust in TSB and in the banking sector as a whole.\nHe also said TSB had not met regulations to refund all relevant customers as soon as practicable or by the end of the business day after the day which it became aware of the fraud.\nMrs Morgan said: \u0026ldquoThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u0026rsquos poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced, by its response to customer fraud and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the committee.\n\u0026ldquoThe committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u0026rsquos letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.\nMr Bailey\u0026rsquos letter also revealed that at the time of writing, more than 40% of calls to TSB were still abandoned or disconnected before progressing through the IVR (interactive voice recognition system) and wait times to speak to an agent had at times been longer than 30 minutes.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Josie Clarke, Press Association Consumer Affairs Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u002727675ccf-d774-4ee4-b137-2a01368a3b5f\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:finance,paservice:finance:city,paservice:finance:personal-finance,paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Financial regulator to investigate TSB IT migration\u0027})\n"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7484923.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Festival guests left feeling cheesed off call for a refund","story":"              GUESTS at a cheese festival who were left disappointed by a lack of the smelly stuff on offer are calling for a refund.\u0026nbsp  The Big Cheese Festival, which was held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre.

In total, 24 fourth-year students from Musselburgh Grammar School received hands-on experience in team building, staging an event, kitchen and cooking essentials, and barista skills as part of an ongoing partnership with the school.  The students also heard presentations from Craig Bonnar of award-winning catering company and official racecourse supplier Heritage Portfolio Susan Manchester, general manager of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art cafes and Sarah Montgomery, the racecourse\u0026rsquos senior operations and commercial manager.  Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.  This year, Musselburgh was one of 20 UK racecourses to take part in the Racing Together Community Day, which supports a range of activities in local communities.

She said: \u0026ldquoThis kind of real-life insight into the world of work and the wider hospitality and tourism sector is extremely helpful in giving students the experience and information which will help them decide on a career path they could potentially follow on leaving school.  \u0026ldquoAccess to the racecourse facilities and to experienced industry professionals who can share valuable insights is a real bonus and we are delighted that Musselburgh Racecourse was willing to work with us in supporting our young students as they prepare to transition from education to the working world."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.  Ana grew up on Haddington\u0026rsquos Alderston Meadow and met drummer Amy, who lived on the town\u0026rsquos Long Cram and attended Knox Academy, during a night out in the town\u0026rsquos Mercat Hotel.  The band is completed by Ross Archibald, Ryan Zdrojewski and Tara Behran.  On the band members\u0026rsquo friendship, Ana added: \u0026ldquoWe love going for sushi together and try to practice twice a week, maybe for five hours."},{"url":null,"title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

The second sculpture has been placed at the rear of Caponhall Court.  It has been designed to celebrate the industry which built the town, with a farmer and coal miner both carved out of stone.  Standing two metres high, the coal miner is depicted at the bottom, with the farmer gathering his crop above it.  On the side of the sculpture on the Elphinstone side of the road is carved the word \u0026lsquoTranent\u0026rsquo.  On the Tranent side of the sculpture, the town\u0026rsquos motto \u0026lsquoLie Forrit\u0026rsquo has been emblazoned down it."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7859178.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Depute to become new headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School","story":"              A DEPUTE headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School will make the step up and take the helm at the school.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.

East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.

Full of fun, mishaps and lively dance routines, the Roaring Twenties will be brought to life on stage over the next four evenings with a run of performances.  East Lothian group Encore was formed in 1993 after parents saw how much fun their children were having with local group Musical Youth and they wanted to join in. Musical Youth was set up in 1992 by Peter and Heather Antonelli to provide an outlet for the talent of local children. They are formerly from Prestonpans but now live in Gullane.  Playing the part of Millie is Alison Henry, from Prestonpans, who was in the first show with Musical Youth 25 years ago. Her mum Anne Henry, a founder member of Encore, takes on the role of the stern office manager Miss Flannery. Hazel Gray, Heather\u0026rsquos sister, is playing the sinister Mrs Meers.

The latest success for 20-year-old Rebecca Traynor was coming top in the recent final of Linlithgow\u0026rsquos Got Talent.  The soprano was also among the finalists for a competition on Forth 1 to find a singer to perform a contemporary pop song on the station\u0026rsquos breakfast show.  She made it through an initial round that saw her sing on the show and, on Monday, she joined other contestants at Forth House for auditions.  However, the former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil was not chosen as the overall winner.  Rebecca\u0026rsquos singing talent was first spotted by her class teacher when she was a pupil at Pinkie St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School. She won the school\u0026rsquos talent competition at the age of 10, performing Hallelujah.  Her teacher phoned her dad to say she thought Rebecca had a good voice and might benefit from lessons. This was duly done and she developed her skills with advice on breathing and holding notes from a coach.  She completed exams held by Trinity College London \u0026ndash the international exam board for the performing arts and English language.  Rebecca, from Edenhall, is also a former winner of the Musselburgh Rotary Club Young Musician of the Year competition.

A study by researchers at the universities of Oxford and Bath found the health costs to the NHS and society was worst in cities, with the cost from the average car in inner London over the vehicle\u0026rsquos lifetime on the road at \u0026pound7,714.  For diesel cars in the heart of the city, the\u0026nbsphealth costs from pollutants nitrogen dioxide and tiny particles known as particulate matter or PM2.5, is as high as \u0026pound16,424, the report released ahead of Clean Air Day on June 21 found.  On average across the country,\u0026nbsphealth costs from air pollution that could be attributed to a typical UK car running on fossil fuels over its 14-year\u0026nbsplifetime amount to \u0026pound1,640, while a van costs \u0026pound5,107 over its nine years on the road.  Battery-powered electric vehicles are much less dangerous to health because they create no tailpipe emissions, though they still generate polluting particles through wear on tyres and braking.  The health damage from emissions from diesel vehicles, which produce far more nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, is about five times higher than petrol vehicles and 20 times greater than for electric vehicles.  If every new car in 2019\u0026nbsp were electric it would save more than \u0026pound325 million in health costs in the first year, according to environmental charity Global Action Plan which organises Clean Air Day.  And swapping one in four car journeys in urban areas for walking or cycling could save more than \u0026pound1.1 billion in damage to health each year, Global Action Plan said.  Air pollution is linked to about 40,000 premature deaths each year in the UK, compared with 98,000 preventable deaths a year which are attributable to smoking, the report said.  About a quarter of the problem is caused by cars and vans, according to the researchers, with costs due to the early deaths as well as hospital admissions and treatment of illnesses related to breathing dirty air.  Nearly 90% of all the health costs associated with pollution from cars and vans is down to diesel vehicles.  Dr Alistair Hunt from the University of Bath said:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoOur research for the first time illustrates the individual cost that each car and van has on the NHS and wider society.  \u0026ldquoEvery time these vehicles are driven, they are having a significant\u0026nbsp impact on our health, equivalent to \u0026pound7,714 for an average inner London car over its lifetime.  Dr Christian Brand, from the University of Oxford and UK Energy Research Centre, said: \u0026ldquoCars and vans are responsible for 10,000 early deaths each year, and diesel vehicles are the main problem unfortunately.  \u0026ldquoThe valuation of health effects associated with diesel vehicles are at least five times greater than those associated with petrol vehicles, and around 20 times greater than battery electric vehicles.  Chris Large from Global Action Plan said:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoThis report clearly illustrates the true cost of air pollution from each petrol and diesel car and van, particularly in inner cities.   He said switching a million cars from diesel to electric would save more than \u0026pound360 million in health costs from local air pollution, while ditching the car for walking or cycling in a quarter of journeys would save \u0026pound1.1 billion.  \u0026ldquoThis demonstrates the impact that people\u0026rsquos individual choices can have, so we would look to the government to use Clean Air Day as a springboard for year round public engagement through its new clean air strategy.  Global Action Plan has found that London tops the league of worst UK cities for the costs to the NHS of pollution from cars and vans, totalling \u0026pound605 million, while Birmingham\u0026rsquos vehicles cost around \u0026pound150 million.  Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said the economic case for cleaning up the air we breathe had been \u0026ldquolaid bare.  Meanwhile Sue Hayman, Labour\u0026rsquos shadow environment secretary, said the Government had failed to take decisive and quick action to tackle the \u0026ldquopublic health emergency.  \u0026ldquoAir pollution has been at illegal levels for years under this Conservative Government and now we know the true cost to the NHS of their inaction, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe time for endless consultations and shunting this problem onto local councils has to end.  Martin Tett, environment spokesman at the Local Government Association, said Government plans needed to be underpinned by local flexibility, appropriate powers and sufficient funding.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we\u0026rsquore to truly tackle air pollution, we need Government support to enable us to deliver effective local plans, and robust national action to help the country transition to low-emission\u0026nbspvehicles and power generation."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7437880.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"What the papers say     June 6","story":"              Labour Brexit policy and violent crime make headlines on Tuesday.

The head of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a letter to Treasury Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan that the regulator would carry out a joint investigation with the Prudential Regulation Authority.  Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, noted: \u0026ldquoWe do not normally make this information public, but, given the level of public interest, I want to be clear that we will be conducting this work.  Mrs Morgan released correspondence with the watchdog in which Mr Bailey said TSB chief executive Paul Pester\u0026rsquos evidence to the committee in May was \u0026ldquoan optimistic view and \u0026ldquogreater caution would have made sense.  Mr Bailey said Dr Pester could have shared \u0026ldquomore detail with the committee, including the initial views of a team of experts from IBM who were drafted in to help solve the crisis.  Up to 1.9 million people using TSB\u0026rsquos digital and mobile banking found themselves locked out of their bank accounts following the migration of data on customers from former owner Lloyds\u0026rsquo IT system to a new one managed by current owner Sabadell.  Last month, Dr Pester told MPs on the Treasury Committee that he took \u0026ldquoabsolute responsibility for the problems, but said the migration of billions of customer records was successful \u0026ldquoto the penny and the underlying engine of the bank was \u0026ldquoworking well.  He is due to appear in front of the committee again on Wednesday.  In his May 30 letter responding to Mrs Morgan\u0026rsquos request for information, Mr Bailey wrote: \u0026ldquoThe FCA has been dissatisfied with TSB\u0026rsquos communications with its customers and we have had concerns that TSB was not being open and transparent about the issues experienced, adding that the bank\u0026rsquos response \u0026ldquocould reduce trust in TSB and in the banking sector as a whole.  He also said TSB had not met regulations to refund all relevant customers as soon as practicable or by the end of the business day after the day which it became aware of the fraud.  Mrs Morgan said: \u0026ldquoThe regulator does not make such criticisms lightly. I am deeply concerned by TSB\u0026rsquos poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced, by its response to customer fraud and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester to the committee.  \u0026ldquoThe committee will discuss Mr Bailey\u0026rsquos letter, and the ongoing problems faced by TSB customers, when it sees Dr Pester and other TSB board members, as well as the FCA, on Wednesday.  Mr Bailey\u0026rsquos letter also revealed that at the time of writing, more than 40% of calls to TSB were still abandoned or disconnected before progressing through the IVR (interactive voice recognition system) and wait times to speak to an agent had at times been longer than 30 minutes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7627264.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.  Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

A mutant strain of the infection - which can not be treated with the usual course of antibiotics - struck in Britain for the first time earlier this year.  Health officials now fear there could be more cases after recording 44,676 diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2017 - a 22% increase on the previous year.  The report from Public Health England also told of a 20% year-on-year rise in deadly syphilis - a 148% increase on 2008 figures.  Speaking today (Tues) Debbie Laycock, from sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos stats confirm the number of STIs diagnosed in England remains worryingly high against a backdrop of damaging cuts to sexual health services.  \"Our sexual health services are stretched too thinly and demand outweighs availability, with more cuts already planned.  \u0026ldquoThe significant rise in both syphilis and gonorrhoea shows why further cuts are completely unacceptable and would be extremely damaging, particularly given the emergence of a new extensively drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea.  The report warned that the 44,676 diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2017 was of \u0026ldquoconcern given the recent emergence of extensively drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  It was seen for the first time in the UK earlier this year, when a UK man he picked up the disease after a sexual encounter with a woman in south-east Asia.  Two further cases were idenified in Australia soon after.  Left untreated, gonorrhoea can lead to complications including infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease.  Pregnant women can also pass on the disease to their baby during labour.  The report added: \"The large increase in gonorrhoea diagnoses between 2016 and 2017 is concerning due to the ongoing circulation of high-level azithromycin resistant gonorrhoea.  \u0026ldquoAdditionally, the first detected case of extensively drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae with resistance to ceftriaxone and high-level resistance to azithromycin, the two antibiotics used as front-line dual therapy, was detected in the UK in March 2018.  \u0026ldquoSoon after two cases with similar antimicrobial resistance profiles were later detected in Australia.  \u0026ldquoAll three cases were associated with travel to south-east Asia.  The newly-released report said that in 2017 there were 422,147 diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) made in England, around the same number that was reported in 2016.  More than 1.3 million chlamydia tests were carried out and over 126,000 chlamydia diagnoses were made among youngsters aged 15 to 24.  There was a 90% reduction in genital wart cases, mainly thanks to a high school immunisation programme, it said.  The impact of STIs remains greatest in young heterosexuals aged 15 to 24, black ethnic minorities, and gay and bisexual men, the report said.  Mrs Laycock added: \u0026ldquoThere is a small decline in chlamydia diagnoses, but this isn\u0026rsquot good news as there\u0026rsquos also been an 8% decline in testing for chlamydia.  \"Most worryingly, that includes a 61% drop in chlamydia testing in sexual and reproductive health services in just two years.  \u0026ldquoYoung people, those from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities, gay and bisexual men, and people living with HIV continue to be the most affected by STIs. More work must be done to ensure people from these groups have access to the information and sexual health services they need to improve and look after their sexual health.  \u0026ldquoThe fact that young people continue to be disproportionately affected when it comes to STIs clearly shows a much needed emphasis on sexual health and STIs when relationships and sex education (RSE) becomes compulsory in England from 2019. We want to see sexual health check-ups normalised among young people, and no different to visiting the dentist or doctor.  \u0026ldquoThe welcomed decline in HPV-related genital warts is as a result of vaccinating girls against HPV before they become sexually active.  \u0026ldquoIn order to make further progress and address the markedly higher rates in boys, we need to see that vaccination programme extended to boys too, in order to drive down rates of preventable cancers later in life.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos no clear plan for tackling consistently high rates of STIs. The situation needs to improve quickly and learnings from the recent drop in new HIV diagnoses would be a good place to start.  \u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore calling on local authorities and Government to face up to what\u0026rsquos happening, urgently work together and ensure sexual health services are properly funded to meet local demand."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7863021.jpg?type=article-full","title":"  These beautiful Scottish courses are perfect if you re game for golf","story":"              Regarded as one of the best places in the world to play golf, Scotland is home to many\u0026nbspfantastic courses. Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.    The course was set out by the celebrated James Braid for the Duke of Montrose in 1936 on the parkland of the Duke\u0026rsquos estate, so its holes and fairways are framed by majestic trees and magnificent views of the Trossachs.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens.

To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale.

However, for nearly a decade, the ground breaking arts company NVA seemed to have found new hope, and a future, for St Peter\u0027s Seminary in Cardross.  But now that future has been derailed, after the announcement that the company will close in September this year.  NVA, an acclaimed and innovative company led by creative director Angus Farquhar, will cease operations this year, months after losing out in the controversial Regular Funding decisions made by Creative Scotland, the arts funding body.  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  Last night, the culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study the former seminary, designed and built by the late Glasgow architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein in 1966, and report on its \"long term options.\"  Ms Hyslop said she would like the building to \"continue to fascinate and inspire the public\" and noted that she was \"very sad\" that NVA is to close, adding \"since its foundation 25 years ago, it has earned a reputation as one of the most innovative public arts companies.\"  The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the world\u0027s most endangered cultural landmarks.  NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in 2016, and this year have made a film with artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term \u0026pound11m project to transform the \"stablised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.  Since 2013, NVA spent \u0026pound2.3m on the building, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of 80 vaults, improving paths, clearing away invasive plants, and woodland management in the 104 acre site.  Revealed: The Mackintosh design you chose for our print giveaway  The building still belongs to the Archdiocese of Glasgow, for which a spokesman said: \"We are sorry to learn of the closure of NVA and the subsequent impact on plans to secure and develop the former St Peter\u0026rsquos College at Cardross.  \"NVA were visionary in their hopes for the college site and it is a great shame that these hopes will not now be realised.  \"The Archdiocese will now consider its options and consider any proposal to develop the site in a way which will secure the architecture of the former college and benefit the local community.\"  NVA\u0027s other works include the Hidden Gardens at the Tramway in Glasgow, The Secret Sign in Finnich Glen, a show in Central Hotel in 1999, Grand Central, and The Path in Glen Lyon in 2000.  It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  A board statement said: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  A Creative Scotland spokeswoman said: \"NVA has been one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most creatively ambitious companies, producing ground-breaking work that has attracted national and international attention, including their ambitious plans for St. Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary.  \"We appreciate how difficult this decision has been for the Board and staff of NVA and will continue to offer support and advice to all those involved.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Young influencers in Edinburgh digital tourism push","story":"              ONLINE influencers are being recruited to help boost young traveller numbers to Edinburgh.

A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) found 58 per cent were \u0026ldquounlikely to endorse a career in teaching. Only two per cent would be \u0026ldquovery likely to do so.  The greatest concern was spiralling workload with 85 per cent saying it had increased in the past year - despite a pledge by John Swinney, the Education Secretary, to tackle the problem.  Read more: John Swinney\u0027s war on workload a long way from being won  Changes to the curriculum were seen as a key area of dissatisfaction while teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted.  The findings comes after a sustained period of upheaval in education with significant changes to the curriculum and associated exams.  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit staff in some subjects creating additional work for the remaining staff.  Concerns of individual teachers were also included in the EIS survey with one stating: \u0026ldquoThe curriculum becomes more cluttered every year ... everything taught at a rushed and superficial pace.  Another said: \u0026ldquoStaffing shortages have created a significant increase in workload.  Teachers said the fall in the number of support staff to deal with children with conditions such as autism and dyslexia was creating extra pressure.  Another said: \u0026ldquoWorkload has reached a point that it significantly impacts on my home life.  \u0026ldquoI have less time with my family and feel more stressed. I am so tired at the end of the school day and then have more work to do at home. It is depressing.  Read more: Workload blamed for teacher exodus  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, described the survey results as \u0026ldquoworrying reading.  \u0026ldquoDespite statements from the Scottish Government, local authorities and national education bodies that promised action to tackle excessive levels of teacher workload, the results of our survey indicate little has improved and some difficulties actually seems to have grown worse, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe have frequently been told that meaningful pay rises are unaffordable, but that extra teachers are being employed and that workload is being tackled.  \u0026ldquoThese survey results confirm that teachers are seeing little improvement, and that severe pressure continues to be piled onto our overworked, undervalued and underpaid teachers.  Opposition parties blamed the Scottish Government for the concerns.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour said: \u0026ldquoScotland has thousands fewer teachers since the SNP came to power, and with most professionals not recommending the job it could get even worse.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time John Swinney restored teachers\u0026rsquo pay and gave our children the resources they need to succeed in school.

Food giant Heinz is set to ditch the famous name for the first time in 104 years claiming that as only 14 per cent of buyers actually used the gloopy white sauce on salads, the old name no longer reflects its modern purpose.  A spokesman for Heinz said that the name no longer \"fairly represents the product\u0027s ingredients or usage occasions.\"  Parent group Kraft Heinz said it was working with brand design specialists Jones Knowles Ritchie on overhauling one of Britain\u0027s longest running kitchen staples.  It would be the first name change for the product since its launch in 1914.    Fans of the traditional name went on social media to express their anger.  It is believed Heinz is considering adopting the name Sandwich Cream to better reflect how the country uses the condiment and to appeal to \"younger shoppers\".  UK sales of the brand dipped 5.4 per cent to \u0026pound28.8 million last year.  A Heinz spokesman added: \"As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers.  \"There are consumers now who haven\u0027t grown up with the brand in the household and just don\u0027t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.\"  The consultation process means the earliest a new name will be introduced is in September.    The condiment became a national favourite during the 1940s, Heinz says, when ketchup was unavailable and salad cream was used to add flavour to bland war-time rations.  In 1999, it was revealed that Heinz were about to ditch the brand but once the leak was published it led to a major protest by shoppers and it saved the brand.  The publicity helped sales and Heinz took advantage by relaunching Salad Cream in new-look packs and putting the price up."},{"url":null,"title":"UK Government defends RBS shares sale at   2 1bn loss  saying it s  value for money ","story":"              THE UK Government has defended the sale of a 7.7 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a \u0026pound2.1 billion loss to the UK taxpayer, insisting it was \"value for money\".  Lord Bates, the Treasury spokesman, dismissed criticism of the move from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords.  Answering an urgent question, he said the sale would raise \u0026pound2.5bn, representing \"value for money for the taxpayer\".  The Conservative peer said RBS was a \"smaller, simpler and safer organisation\" than the one the Government was forced to recapitalise in 2008 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u0026pound46bn and the sale price reflected that \"reality\".  But Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer demanded: \"Why sell now crystallising a loss that rises to in excess of \u0026pound3bn when financing costs are included and when there is no pressure..?\"  She warned that by acting now the Government could be selling shares on an \"inaccurate prospectus, ignoring growing allegations that liabilities to those abused by RBS\u0027s global restructuring group... are inadequately quantified, not declared and not provided for within the accounts\".  But Lord Bates said that when the Government paid 502p per share in 2008 it was an \"essential injection of capital\" at a time of financial crisis the bank was now, he insisted, in a very different organisation.  Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said the shares were being sold at a \"massive level below\" the 2008 bailout with the taxpayer bearing the cost and leaving the public to \"lose on the deal significantly\".  Lord Bates hit back, telling him: \"You may say we sold it too cheaply. I might say that you bought it too high.\"  He said the price was \"near the top end of the yearly average\" and the Government had signalled it shouldn\u0027t be in the business of \"running these banks\".  Tory former Cabinet minister Lord King of Bridgwater backed the sale as being an \"entirely sensible procedure to bring in some money while we can\".  Lord Bates said the Opposition was forgetting what the situation was in 2008 and the \"incredible damage done to our economy, which we are still having to clear up\".  He said the sale proceeds would go directly to reduce the debt accumulated in 2008.  Outwith Parliament, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister when the bank was bailed out, said there was \"no excuse\" for selling the shares at under their potential value.  Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, also insisted there was no need to sell the RBS shares now.  \u0026ldquoThere was no need for the Conservatives to cost the taxpayer more than \u0026pound2bn, he declared.  \"There is continuing uncertainty on a number of RBS\u0026rsquo legacy issues. Ministers should instead have been using their position as the biggest shareholder to make sure management put the bank in order so that the share price recovered before selling any of the stake,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland s last great auk to be immortalised in bronze","story":"              STANDING three feet tall, with a curved black beak and glossy black and white feathers, it was one of the most impressive birds ever to call Scotland its home.  The great auk was the country\u0026rsquos answer to the penguin \u0026ndash large, flightless and ungainly on land, yet fast and agile in the water. Yet in the end they became Scotland\u0026rsquos dodo, wiped out by the carelessness of men who hunted them for their meat and feathers, and doomed the species to extinction.  Today, all that remains of the great auk is their little cousins \u0026ndash puffins, razorbills and other seabirds of the same family \u0026ndash and a few preserved remains floating in jars and stuffed carcasses on museum shelves.  Now preparations are being made to commemorate one of the final members of the species to be killed in Scotland with a bronze replica.  The great auk was one of a pair which nested on the Orkney island of Papa Westray, and met its demise at the hands of hunters in 1813. Six years later, in 1819, the bird\u0026rsquos stuffed remains were purchased by the Natural History Museum, and it is only British specimen in existence.  A clay statue was made of the bird to mark the spot where it had been shot, at Fowl Crag, on the north of the island, but this was damaged in a recent storm and lost its head. Although it has been repaired, the replica is only 10in tall and plans are being made to use scans which were taken of its stuffed remains to have a life-size version made in bronze. Jonathan Ford, the ranger on Papa Westray who repaired the damaged clay version, said that a new statue would be a fitting tribute to one of the last great auks of Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll always keep the original statue \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a lot of history with it and it\u0026rsquos got a long association with the island. But the bronze statue would be life-size and a model of the actual bird which was taken from here, so it would be like it is coming home. They used to be widespread on Papa Westray, and it is very sad that the last ones were driven into extinction.  Great auks ranged over much of the north Atlantic for thousands of years and could be found nesting in crags and cliffs from America to Europe.  Used as a food source, their remains have been found in sites that were home to Neanderthals in Gibraltar 100,000 years ago, while early humans daubed their images on cave walls 35,000 years ago.  One great auk bone dating from the fifth century was uncovered recently near the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, indicating they were also eaten by medieval Scots.  However, they were hunted relentlessly in the 18th and 19th century as European ships spread out across the globe, with sailors using them as living larders they could pack on to boats. Their feathers, which were rich with oil, were also highly prized both as a fuel source and by the down industry as filling for quilts.  Tales have come down from the era of great auks being herded on to boats in large flocks, or used as fuel on treeless islands because they burned so easily.  Their persecution was famously cruel, with hunters advised to strip their feathers while the birds were still alive before leaving them to perish from the elements.  Britain banned the killing of the bird in 1794, except by fishermen. But by then it was too late.  The final great auk found in the British Isles is said to have been taken on a sea stack off of St Kilda, by fishermen hunting gannets.  They tied its feet and took it onboard their boat, only to become superstitious and fearful a few days later during a storm. Believing the bird to be \u0026ldquoa maelstrom-conjuring witch, they beat it to death. The last known great auks were killed on the island of Elday, off the coast of Iceland, by sailors hunting them for a museum collector in 1844.  Scottish Seabird Centre chief executive, Tom Brock said: \u0026ldquoThe really important thing is it reminds us that animals are still going extinct, even in Scotland. We should not take them for granted. One of the great auk\u0026rsquos close relatives, the puffin, has been put on to the red endangered list.  \u0026ldquoWe must protect and conserve safeguard seabird populations or more species will go the same way as the great auk."},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn to push for  new single market  deal in crunch Commons vote","story":"              LABOUR is to push for a \"new single market\" deal for the UK after Brexit as the UK Government faces crunch votes in the Commons next week.

Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said: \"Labour will only accept a Brexit deal that delivers the benefits of the single market and protects jobs and living standards.  \"Unlike the Tories, Labour will not sacrifice jobs and the economy in the pursuit of a reckless and extreme interpretation of the referendum result.  \"Existing single market agreements that the EU has negotiated with third countries, including Norway, are bespoke deals negotiated with the EU to serve the best interests of those countries.  \"We need to learn from them and negotiate our own more ambitious agreement, which serves our economic interests and which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.

Without an overall majority, the Prime Minister is expected to spend the coming days trying to sweet-talk and strong-arm potential rebels who could inflict defeat on some of the Government\u0027s key Brexit positions.  In response to Labour\u0026rsquos amendment, Suella Braverman, the Brexit Minister, said: \"Labour have shattered their promise to respect the referendum result this amendment means accepting free movement and continuing to follow EU rules with absolutely no say in them, which is the worst of all worlds.  \"Only the Conservatives will get the best deal for the whole country - delivering on the referendum vote to get control of our money, borders and laws, while building a strong new relationship with Europe.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspPoll suggests anti-Brexit feeling at highest level since aftermath of 2016 referendum  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \"Any Brexit scenario is damaging but remaining in the single market and customs union would be the least worst option to protect the economy, jobs and livelihoods.  \"Labour need to quit playing games and do the right thing support the UK\u0027s continued membership of the single market and customs union,\" added the Fife MP.  Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, accused Mr Corbyn and Mrs May of being involved in \u0026ldquosome bizarre contest as to which of them could be the most misleading to the British public about the consequences of Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThe amendments tabled by the Labour Party are proof, if proof is needed, that Jeremy Corbyn is far from being the brave defender of the pro-EU cause that he would have us believe.

The Hidden Gardens, behind the Tramway in Glasgow\u0027s south side, still stands.  And in the last ten years the small arts charity, led by Angus Farquhar - who previously had been in the industrial music group Test Department - also wrought significant change at St Peter\u0027s Seminary. For NVA to take on, and try to transform, the modern ruin, did always seem like an ambitious, perhaps extraordinary, task.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish arts firm to close this year and abandons plans to restore St Peters  The company did begin work on its project to breathe new life into the ruin: deadly asbestos was cleared, the vaults were stabilised, and thousands of invasive rhododendron bushes have been removed. But ultimately, without a major national institution to step in (which, at some point, perhaps NVA was half expecting to happen) and provide funding, scale and stability, the project proved too much. The public money that was raised for the project and not used was paid back last year. The company will close without lurching into bankruptcy, I am told. But NVA is over, and who knows if art work like Speed of Light or The Path in Glen Lyon will be attempted again.  What cannot be lost in the closure of NVA is the role of Creative Scotland, the nation\u0027s arts funder. In January, in the Regular Funding round which has been the cause of much controversy and debate, NVA were not granted regular funding. It had been funded before. At the time it seemed a surprising decision, but was somewhat lost in the tumult surrounding similar decisions in theatre and music. Mr Farquhar, too, did not - at least in public - kick up much of a fuss. Perhaps he was politic to do so. However, when Creative Scotland made a series of U-turns on its cuts, NVA was not among the reprieved.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspScottish arts firm to close this year and abandons plans to restore St Peters  Mr Farquhar will, one suspects, find a new outlet for his creativity, and one hopes his team can find new jobs, too.

It was rather moving, and brought home the extent to which the metropolis truly is a multicultural city. It\u0026rsquos sometimes hard to believe that the indigenous white population is still in a majority here.  Step off the train back in Scotland and you are in a different world. Scotland remains a conspicuously white nation. Indeed, the most visible social difference now between Scotland and England today is arguably not nationality, but race. Despite a significant increase in immigration in the past decade, Black And Minority Ethnic \u0026ndash BAME \u0026ndash still really means that: minority. In the last census there were only around 40,000 Afro-Carribbeans recorded as living in the whole of Scotland.  Which makes it doubly ludicrous that the Home Office seems determined to expel those few who make it here, such as the student nurse, Denzel Darku. He has lost two appeals against deportation on the grounds that he cannot prove he is dependent on his father, who lives in Edinburgh and is an EU citizen. This is typical of the Catch-22 rules that have grown up like a dense thicket around our immigration law since Theresa May introduced her \u0026ldquohostile environment to migrants five years ago.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It makes no sense that this capable and responsible young man, who was a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and carried the Queen\u0026rsquos Baton at the Commonwealth Games, is likely to be deported after his final appeal next week. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday that he was \u0026ldquosympathetic, but this will cut little ice with the hard-faced men and women of the British immigration service, for whom \u0026ldquocomputer says no is the whole of the law.  It is often said that hostility to immigration grows in inverse proportion to the number of immigrants actually living in a given area. Hence, diverse London voted for Remain, while Brexit, and Ukip, are stronger in white English townships. But that rule doesn\u0026rsquot seem to apply to Scotland. There is racism if you care to look for it, of course. But it is obvious from the composition of the Scottish Parliament that race and immigration are not significant political issues in Scotland. You rarely see those \u0026ldquoMigrant Crisis front pages that have disgraced English news-stands in recent years because newspaper readers don\u0026rsquot buy them.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in Holyrood, the Scottish parties united to jeer and goad Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Tories when they failed to voice support for the First Minister in her defence of Mr Darku. Some Tory MSPs allegedly cried \u0026ldquosend him home, which to me seems most unlikely because casual hostility to immigrants is not tolerated in Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party. Woe betide the Scottish Tory councillor who makes even a daft joke about immigrants. To be fair to the Conservatives, they have never seriously attempted to make race and immigration an issue in Scotland, because they know there are no votes in it.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon attacks \u0027shameful\u0027 Tory silence on deportation case  Yet in England, immigration remains a massive issue that underpinned the Brexit vote, and still has politicians of all parties running scared. This week, Mrs May repeated her nonsense proposal to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands \u0026ndash a target which would be economically ruinous to Britain if it were even remotely achievable. The UK economy has benefited from immigration, largely in recent years from the European Union. Migrants invariably come to Britain to work and to pay taxes, which have helped to pay for public services and run the NHS.  Scotland needs immigrants more than the rest of the UK because our population is ageing faster than the rest of the UK. This in turn is partly because low-growth Scotland continues to lose qualified younger workers because of the lack of jobs here. This is not going to change any time soon. The Scottish Fiscal Commission has forecast that Scottish growth will remain at near-recession levels of less than one per cent for the next five years. If there are able and industrious young people who want to come to Scotland to work and contribute, like Mr Darku, we should be doing everything possible to keep them here.  It beggars belief that the UK Government doesn\u0026rsquot see this. The refusal to meet the First Minister\u0026rsquos calls for the devolution of immigration policy makes no political sense. Mrs May could undermine the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopower grab claims about the impact of the EU Withdrawal Bill, by promising a regionally-based immigration regime, such as exists in Canada or Australia. It would shoot Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos fox. She\u0026rsquod find it harder to argue that Scotland was losing out because of Brexit and Westminster insensitivity to Scottish concerns.  One suspects Mr Javid would introduce such a policy if he could, and is plainly embarrassed by UK policy as a whole. Michael Gove, the UK Environment Secretary and one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, said before the Brexit referendum that immigration was one of the powers that should come to Scotland after Brexit. All that would be necessary would be to ensure that those migrants who came to Scotland to work were recorded as living here. This will happen anyway since they now have a Scottish tax code.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It\u0026rsquos not as if the UK\u0026rsquos existing immigration policy makes any sense. Mr Javid is desperately trying to find a way of removing the Tier 2 cap that has been preventing much-needed doctors and other highly-qualified people migrating to the UK. Daft earnings requirements are denuding the NHS of nurses and other lower paid workers. It is absurd that 450,000 international students are included in the immigration statistics, since few will remain here. The Windrush scandal has visibly changed attitudes towards our racist immigration rules, which led to British citizens being deported, and others denied housing because of their colour. England needs a new immigration system as much as Scotland. Theresa May needs to overcome her fear of Ukip and let her apparently open-minded new Home Secretary create one."},{"url":null,"title":"Ken Smith  39 s Diary  Flight of fancy  Just the job and Pass the hankie","story":"              Flight of fancy  THE Government has backed the building of a third runway for Heathrow Airport which has angered a number of environmental campaigners.

The annual Scottish Widows retirement report shows the number of Scots saving for retirement has risen sharply to 84%, up from 75% in 2017.  However, those saving adequately - defined as at least 12% of their income - has stagnated at 58%, down from 59% the year before.  Robert Cochran, retirement expert at Scottish Widows, said: \"While it\u0027s encouraging that more Scots are putting something aside for retirement, the fact that adequate savings levels have stagnated shows that auto-enrolment is not a silver bullet.  The report suggests the trend is expected to continue as about six in 10 Scots (59%) say it is unlikely they will be able to save more in the next year than they do now.  More than a third (35%) said the reason they are not saving more into their workplace pension is because they cannot afford to.  \"It is therefore not surprising that just three in 10 people in Scotland feel optimistic about their retirement, down from 35% last year,\" the report said.  The proportion of UK workers saving adequately for retirement has dropped slightly for the first time since 2013, falling from 56% to 55%.  Despite adequate savings rates rising by 10% since auto-enrolment, the report said a renewed effort is needed to improve the nation\u0027s readiness for retirement.  It added: \"We want to see earnings thresholds scrapped entirely at a much quicker rate, to let all workers benefit from employer contributions.  \"We\u0027d also like to see the age at which workers become auto-enrolled reduced to 18, thereby increasing the number of people who can participate in workplace pensions. \""},{"url":null,"title":"Grenfell refurbishment firms branded inhumane over    corporate cat-and-mouse   ","story":"              Firms involved in refurbishing Grenfell Tower faced a barrage of criticism at the public inquiry as it was claimed \u0026ldquocorporate silence could endanger lives in future.  Several sub-contractors who worked on parts of the refit refused to comment on their work until they had full disclosure of documents, the probe was told on Tuesday.  Stephanie Barwise QC, representing survivors and the bereaved, said the move was \u0026ldquoinhumane, a view echoed by another advocate, Pete Weatherby QC, who warned them not to play \u0026ldquocat-and-mouse.  The work carried out on Grenfell Tower was criticised in withering terms by lawyers speaking on behalf of those affected.  Danny Friedman QC said Kensington and Chelsea council \u0026ldquooversaw a refurbishment of a social housing high rise tower block in such a way as to render it a death trap.  He added: \u0026ldquoThose who escaped owe their lives primarily to chance rather than risk assessment and contingency planning by either the council or the fire brigade.  Polyethylene cladding was wrapped around the west London block during the work, a material \u0026ldquonow openly described by some in the industry as petrol, his colleague Ms Barwise said.  She told the hearing at Holborn Bars that CEP, the sub-contractor which purchased and fabricated the panels, Harley Facades, which installed it, and architects Studio E had all said they cannot yet participate.  \u0026ldquoThese parties make no comment on the detailed criticism of their work, nor do they even comment on drawings that they themselves drafted, she told the hearing.  \u0026ldquoSignificantly, they do not indicate how they proposed to achieve compliance (to building regulations), assuming, that is, that they ever applied their minds to that question.  Expert reports released on Monday identified the cladding system installed on the building as the main reason the flames shot up the side of the tower block with such speed.  Ms Barwise hit out at the corporate bodies over their alleged behaviour.  She said: \u0026ldquoThese contractors should not be allowed, by their deliberate refusal to participate, to derail determination of the compliance issue even though we are concerned with blatant non-compliance.  \u0026ldquoDespite their words of condolence to the victims, these corporates have no desire to assist this inquiry, even though their participation could save lives in the immediate future.  \u0026ldquoThe corporate silence deprives the families of the degree of resolution and understanding to which they are entitled and has only served to increase their pain and uncertainty.  \u0026ldquoIt is inhumane to remain silent when so many seek understanding and answers \u0026ndash answers which are within the corporates\u0026rsquo gift.  Mr Weatherby later agreed: \u0026ldquoThis is a public search for the truth. It is not a game of cat-and-mouse, nor is it a matter of smoke and mirrors.  A statement provided by the Tenant Management Organisation (TMO) was also scrutinised during Tuesday\u0026rsquos hearing.  The TMO ran the building and oversaw the doomed refurbishment that finished a year before the fire.  Sam Stein QC, representing several bereaved and survivors, said: \u0026ldquoThe TMO say this: \u0026lsquoWhy combustible cladding was used on Grenfell Tower is something this inquiry will have to consider.\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoAs the commercial client, it is, we suggest, extraordinary that their opening statement suggests that the TMO is waiting for the inquiry to tell it why it wrapped Grenfell Tower in combustible material.  \u0026ldquoThe TMO was not a small management organisation \u0026ndash they managed 10,000 homes.  At the end of the day, it was suggested by one advocate that the council, TMO and firefighters could be guilty of \u0026ldquoinstitutional racism.  Imran Khan, who once represented the parents of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, said the current terms of reference should be broadened to see if race, religion or social class played any part in the disaster.

He said those in the block from black or minority backgrounds were not described by their clothes or features, but ethnic origin.

Ms Carlson, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes led to his departure, said the board has heard from potential contestants saying: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot want to be out there in high heels and swimsuits.  \u0026ldquoGuess what? she said. \u0026ldquoYou don\u0026rsquot have to anymore.  Asked if she is worried the show\u0026rsquos television ratings might suffer because of the elimination of swimsuits, Ms Carlson said she is not, adding that the swimsuit portion is not the highest rated section of the broadcast.  Viewers seem to be more interested in the talent competition, she said.  She also said the group will make changes to the evening wear portion of the competition, adding it will not judge women on their chosen attire.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos what comes out of their mouths that we care about, she said.  The changes will start with this year\u0026rsquos broadcast on September 9.  Ms Carlson said the Miss America Organisation will emphasise its role as a scholarship provider."}]
